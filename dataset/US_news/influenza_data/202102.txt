The hemagglutinin gene was amplified and sequenced. We identified amino acid (AA) changes and computed antigenic relatedness using the Pepitope model. Phylogenetic analyses revealed multiple clades/subclades of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) were circulating simultaneously and evolved away from their vaccine strain, but not the influenza B virus. The predominant circulating strains of A(H1N1)pdm09 belonged to 6B.1A1 (2017–2018) and 6B.1A5 (2019–2020) with additional AA substitutions. Clade 3C.2a1b and 3C.2a2 viruses co-circulated in A(H3N2) and clade 3C.3a virus was found in 2020. The B/Victoria-like lineage predominated since 2019 with an additional three AA deletions. Antigenic drift was dominantly facilitated at epitopes Sa and Sb of A(H1N1)pdm09, epitopes A, B, D and E of A(H3N2), and the 120 loop and 190 helix of influenza B virus. Moderate computed antigenic relatedness was observed in A(H1N1)pdm09. The computed antigenic relatedness of A(H3N2) indicated a significant decline in 2019 (9.17%) and 2020 (− 18.94%) whereas the circulating influenza B virus was antigenically similar (94.81%) with its vaccine strain. Our findings offer insights into the genetic divergence from vaccine strains, which could aid vaccine updating.

The majority of seasonal influenza viruses in circulation are influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and two lineages of the influenza B virus (B/Yamagata-like lineage and B/Victoria-like lineage)2. Annual influenza vaccination can reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality in infected individuals, but in some years the influenza vaccine offers lower than expected efficacy due to antigenic differences against the strains circulating in the community3. In 2014, influenza A(H3N2) clades 3C.2a and 3C.3a have emerged and contributed to reduce the vaccine effectiveness (VE). Reductions in the observed vaccine effectiveness may result from virus evolution over the period and the nature of the egg adaptive substitutions acquired in the vaccine4,5,6. Although influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 evolved at a slower rate than A(H3N2), newly emerging genetic groups have been reported7. In addition, B/Victoria-like lineage strains with deletions are also increasingly prevalent8. The hemagglutinin (HA) protein is an important surface glycoprotein, which possesses the antigenic and receptor-binding sites (RBSs) and elicits the main neutralizing response9,10. The HA protein is divided into the globular head domain (HA1) and the stem domain (HA2). There are proposed antigenic sites on the HA1 of A(H1N1)pdm09 (Sa, Sb, Ca1, Ca2, and Cb) and on the HA1 of A(H3N2) (A through E)9,11,12. Meanwhile, there are four major HA antigenic sites for influenza B virus (120 loop, 150 loop, 160 loop, and 190 helix)13. Accumulation of mutations in the HA protein, particularly on the antigenic sites, RBSs and the surrounding region, has enabled the continuous evolution and the emergence of new influenza virus strains12,14,15, which escape the existing neutralizing antibodies16. As a result, the influenza virus strains to be included in the annual vaccine composition are carefully evaluated each year8,17.Although influenza activity in Thailand occurs throughout the year, it is often bimodal18. Most influenza infection occur in the rainy season (August to November), but frequent infection can also occur in the cooler and drier months of January to March18,19. Thailand is geographically located in the northern hemisphere, but the vaccine formulation for the southern hemisphere is used. Thai people are annually vaccinated between April and May which corresponds to the beginning of the peak of influenza activity20. Typically, the vaccine composition for the southern hemisphere is determined many months before the actual influenza season begins in order to allow time for production and distribution21,22. Occasionally, the selected strains to be included in the vaccine are not well-matched (antigenically dissimilar) with the actual circulating strains and subsequently resulted in the poor vaccine effectiveness (VE) as happened during the 2014–201523,24.Periodic monitoring of the influenza virus strains circulating in the region is important for antigenic characterization and improved vaccine design. Here, we examined the influenza incidence from July 2017 and March 2020 from samples submitted for routine diagnostics from three hospitals in Thailand. We characterized the genetic and antigenic variations of the HA gene on 90 strains of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 90 strains of influenza A(H3N2), and 81 strains of influenza B virus sampled monthly over the study period. Deduced amino acid changes were mapped on the HA three-dimensional structures, and the computed antigenic relatedness was analyzed for each influenza (sub)types.Materials and methodsSample collection and ethics statementRespiratory specimens comprising of nasopharyngeal swabs were submitted for testing as part of the routine influenza surveillance from July 2017 to March 2020 from patients with influenza-like illness (ILI). ILI was defined as fever (body temperature > 38 °C) combined with respiratory symptoms (cough, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat). A total of 17,480 samples from Bangpakok 9 International Hospital (n = 14,743), King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital (n = 266), and Chum Phae Hospital (n = 2,471) were tested. Viral RNA was extracted directly from clinical samples by using Ribospin vRD II according to the manufacturer’s instructions (GeneAll Biotechnology, Seoul, Korea). Real-time reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to identify A(H1N1pdm09), A(H3N2), and the influenza B virus as previously described25. Laboratory-confirmed influenza B-positive samples were subjected to cDNA synthesis with primer FluB (5′-AGCAGAAGCA-3′) and ImProm-II Reverse Transcription System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), followed by multiplex PCR and melting-curve analysis26. The study protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Faculty of Medicine of Chulalongkorn University (IRB No. 127/61). Informed consent was obtained from all subjects, and all methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.Amplification of the hemagglutinin geneSamples positive for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (n = 90), influenza A(H3N2) (n = 90), or influenza B virus (n = 81) sampled monthly throughout the study period were subjected to conventional RT-PCR to amplify the entire HA gene and Sanger sequencing. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) were subjected to cDNA synthesis using primer Uni12 (5′-AGCAAAAGCAGG-3′). The primer sets for both influenza A and B viruses have been described elsewhere27,28. PCR mixture of 25 μL contained 5 μL of AccuStart II GelTrack PCR SuperMix (Quantabio, Beverly, MA, USA), 0.25 mM MgCl2, 0.5 μM each of forward and reverse primers, and 3 μL of cDNA template. Amplification conditions were 94 °C for 3 min, 40 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, 90 s at 72 °C, followed by 7 min of final extension at 72 °C. Amplicons were agarose gel-purified and subjected to Sanger sequencing. Nucleotide sequences were assembled using SeqMan Pro (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA) and deposited in the GenBank database under the accession numbers MT803149–MT803238 for A(H1N1)pdm09, MT803239–MT803328 for A(H3N2) and MT803397–MT803477 for influenza B viruses (Table S1).Genetic characterizationPhylogenetic trees for each influenza virus were generated using the nucleotide sequences obtained from this study and additional HA sequences from other Thai strains previously identified and available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and the Global Initiative for Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) (http://platform.gisaid.org) database. A total of 183 nucleotide sequences of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 232 nucleotide sequences of influenza A(H3N2), and 177 nucleotide sequences of the influenza B virus were aligned with the reference and vaccine strains for each influenza virus using MUSCLE. Nucleotide substitution models for the HA gene of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (TN93 + G), influenza A(H3N2) (HKY + G + I) and influenza B (HKY + G) were implemented in MEGAX29. Trees were constructed using the maximum-likelihood method and bootstrapping of 1,000 replicates. Deduced amino acid sequences were compared to the reference and vaccine strains to identify substitutions, which were noted at each branch node on the phylogenetic trees. Potential N-linked glycosylation sites on the HA gene was analyzed using the NetNGlyc 1.0 server30 and a threshold value of > 0.5.Visualization of amino acid residue changes on the HA structurePublicly available three-dimensional crystal structures of influenza virus HA of influenza virus strains A(H1N1)pdm09 (A/California/04/2009, Protein Data Bank accession number 3LZG), A(H3N2) (A/Victoria/361/2011, accession number 4WE9), B/Victoria (B/Brisbane/60/2008, accession number 4FQM) and B/Yamagata (B/Yamanashi/166/98, accession number 4M44) were used to illustrate approximate residue position and changes on the HA. Identification of residues in the structure was performed using PyMOL Molecular Graphics System v1.3 (Schrödinger; https://www.schrodinger.com). Amino acid single-letter code preceding the numerical position represents residue in the vaccine strains, while amino acid single-letter code following the numerical position represents that found in this study. Vaccine strains were A(H1N1)pdm09 (A/Michigan/45/2015), A(H3N2) clade 3C.2a (A/Hong Kong/4801/2014), A(H3N2) clade 3C.3a (A/Switzerland/9715293/2013), B/Victoria-like lineage (B/Brisbane/60/2008), and B/Yamagata-like lineage (B/Phuket/3073/2013).Determination of selection pressureThe ratio of non-synonymous/synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) was considered when evaluating codon under selective pressure. dN/dS was analyzed using the mixed-effects model of evolution (MEME) and the fixed effects likelihood (FEL) methods. Both algorithms were in the HYPHY software implemented in the Datamonkey webserver (https://www.datamonkey.org/) 31. Positively selected residue was considered significant at P = 0.1.Estimation of computed antigenic relatednessThe antigenic relatedness of influenza virus was computed using the Pepitope model, which took into account the distinct antigenic sites between circulating strains and the vaccine strain by considering the epitope sites. The Pepitope model was calculated by the fraction of number of amino-acid substitutions in the dominant epitope and the total number of amino acids in that dominant epitope. The association between Pepitope model and antigenic distance measured by hemagglutinin inhibition assay or antigenic relatedness (efficacy, E) was determined by a mathematical formula. For A(H1N1)pdm09, E = − 1.19 × Pepitope + 0.53 in which efficacy is 53% when the Pepitope = 032. For A(H3N2), the association between the antigenic relatedness and Pepitope is given by E = − 2.47 × Pepitope + 0.47 in which efficacy is 47% when Pepitope = 033. For the influenza B virus, E = − 0.864 × Pepitope + 0.6824 in which efficacy is 68.24% when Pepitope = 034. The trend of computed antigenic relatedness was identified using R v3.6.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria; https://www.r-project.org). The difference among annually computed antigenic relatedness was calculated using one-way ANOVA (P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant). Statistical analysis was done using Prism 8.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA; https://www.graphpad.com).ResultsIn this study, 20.90% (3654/17,480) of the nasopharyngeal swabs from ILI patients tested positive for influenza virus, of which 74.2% (2711/3654) were influenza A virus and 25.8% (943/3654) were influenza B virus. Typical monthly influenza activity peaked between August and November, and again in January to March (Fig. 1). Among influenza A virus-positive samples, 52.2% (1415/2711) were A(H3N2) and 47.8% (1296/2711) were A(H1N1pdm09). Influenza B virus of the B/Yamagata lineage predominated during the 2017–2018 season and accounted for 48.4% (456/943) over the study period. In comparison, influenza B/Victoria accounted for 51.6% (487/943) and was most predominant in the 2019–2020 season.Figure 1Monthly distribution of influenza A and B viruses from July 2017 to March 2020 (n = 17,480). Numbers above the bar graph indicate the monthly number of influenza virus-positive samples (left Y-axis) with respect to the monthly ILI samples (right Y-axis). The bar graph was generated by using Microsoft Excel (Office 365).Full size imageCharacterization of the clades/subclades based on HA sequences and their divergence from the vaccine strainA(H1N1)pdm09To better understand the genetic changes among the recently circulating influenza strains in Thailand, we selected representative influenza samples for genetic characterization (Table S1). We analyzed the phylogenetic tree of 183 HA sequences of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 comprising the Thai strains identified in this study and previously elsewhere in Thailand, along with the vaccine and reference strains. Compared to A/Michigan/45/2015, the vaccine strain for the southern hemisphere from 2017 and 2019, all of the A(H1N1)pdm09 Thai strains belonged to clade 6B.1 and 89.6% (164/183) further clustered into subclade 6B.1A, which possessed changes of amino acid residue S74R, S164T, and I295V (Fig. 2). Since 2018, circulating Thai strains further diverged to form subclades 6B.1A1, 6B.1A5 and 6B.1A6 which all carried the S183P mutation (Fig. S1). Strains in the subclade 6B.1A5A (characterized by N129D, T185I, D235E, and D260N on HA1, and A193V on HA2) predominated in the 2019–2020 season. Interestingly, a subset of 6B.1A5A Thai strains possessed additional D187A and Q189E changes and clustered with the 2020–2021 season northern hemisphere vaccine strain A/Guangdong-Maonan/SWL1536/2019. The most divergent among the 6B.1A5A subclade was a cluster of strains possessing N156K, K130N, L161I, V250A (HA1) and E179D (HA2). Taken together, these data suggest that the existing A(H1N1)pdm09 strains circulating in recent years have genetically drifted from the A/Brisbane/02/2018, which was introduced as the 2020 southern hemisphere vaccine strain (Fig. S2).Figure 2Phylogenetic analysis of the entire HA gene of A(H1N1)pdm09. Sequences from 90 A/Thailand/CU strains and 93 other Thai strains available from the database were compared with the A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine and reference strains of known clades. Phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum-likelihood method using the TN93 + G model with 1,000 bootstrap replicates implemented in MEGAX. Branch values of > 70% are indicated at the nodes, along with the characteristic residues defining these branches. Residue changes in HA1 are denoted in black; changes in HA2 are in blue. Gain (+ CHO) and loss (−CHO) potential glycosylation sites were indicated. Southern hemisphere vaccine strains (magenta squares), the 2020–21 northern hemisphere vaccine (green squares) and the reference strains (purple squares) are indicated. Colored circles indicate the clade and subclade of A(H1N1)pdm09 circulating strains. VS defined as vaccine strain.Full size imageA(H3N2)Phylogenetic analysis of 232 HA sequences of influenza A(H3N2) comprising the Thai strains identified in this study and previously elsewhere in Thailand, along with the vaccine and reference strains, showed that 98.7% (229/232) belonged to clade 3C.2a (the remaining three Thai strains were 3C.3a, all identified in 2020) (Fig. 3). These Thai strains diverged into subclades 3C.2a1 (defined by N121K, R142G, and N171K on HA1, and I77V and G155E on HA2) and 3C.2a2 (defined by T131K, R142K, and R261Q on HA1) (Fig. S1). Further divergence into 3C.2a1b was marked by E62G, K92R, and H311Q on HA1, and E150G on HA2. Strains identified circulating during 2017–2018 are the 3C.2a1b with addition of T135K that circulated together with 3C.2a2 virus. Most circulating strains in 2019 were 3C.2a1b with T131K, which diverged from the 2019 season southern hemisphere vaccine strain A/Switzerland/8060/2017 (3C.2a2). Co-circulation of 3C.2a1b (with additional T135K and T128A) and 3C.3a virus was identified in the first three months of 2020. The additional residue changes in subclade 3C.2a1b at positions 128 and 135 resulted in a loss of glycosylation at these sites. The 3C.3a virus was characterized by S91N, N144K, F193S on HA1, and I149M and D160N on HA2 (by comparison with A/Switzerland/9,715,293/2013), which were genetically similar to the 2019–2020 season northern hemisphere vaccine strain A/Kansas/14/2017. From our data, A/South Australia/34/2019 chosen for the 2020 A(H3N2) southern hemisphere vaccine strain will not expect a good match since 60% of the currently circulating strains are from 3C.2a1 with T135K and T128A, while 30% are 3C.3a in 2020 (Fig. S2).Figure 3Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene of A(H3N2). Sequences from 90 A/Thailand/CU strains and 142 other Thai strains available from the database were compared with the A(H3N2) vaccine and reference strains of known clades. Phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum-likelihood method using the HKY + G + I model with 1000 bootstrap replicates implemented in MEGAX. Branch values of > 70% are indicated at the nodes, along with the characteristic residues defining these branches. Residue changes in HA1 are denoted in black; changes in HA2 are in blue. Gain (+ CHO) and loss (−CHO) potential glycosylation sites were indicated. Southern hemisphere vaccine strains (magenta squares), the 2019–2021 northern hemisphere vaccine (green squares) and the reference strains (purple squares) are indicated. Colored circles denote the clade and subclade of A(H3N2) circulating strains. VS defined as vaccine strain.Full size imageInfluenza B virusFrom the analysis of 177 HA sequences, the circulating B/Yamagata strains were belonged to clade 3 and experience very little change (L172Q and M251V) compared to the B/Phuket/3073/2013, which served as the southern hemisphere vaccine strain since 2015 (Fig. 4). Our B/Victoria strains belonged to clade 1A and grouped with B/Brisbane/60/2008, which was the vaccine strain prior to 2019. These strains possessed either 162–163 double deletions with I180V, or 162–164 triple deletions with I180T or K136E in HA1. From 2019 onward, however, strains with triple deletions and K136E predominated (68/77), which clustered with the 2020 southern hemisphere vaccine strain B/Washington/02/2019.Figure 4Phylogenetic analyses of the nucleotide sequences of the HA coding region of the influenza B virus. Eighty-one nucleotide sequences from this study (designated A/Thailand/CU) and other Thai strains available from the database during July 2017-March 2020 (n = 96) were compared with the influenza B vaccine and reference strains of known clades (magenta and purple squared, respectively). Phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum-likelihood method and the HKY + G model with 1000 bootstrap replicates implemented in MEGAX. Branch values of > 70% are indicated at nodes. Colored circles denote the clade and subclade of the circulating influenza B virus strains. VS defined as vaccine strain.Full size imageDeduced amino acid changes mapped onto the receptor binding and antigenic sites of HATo visualize how amino acid changes present among the Thai strains in this study may affect important domains on the HA, we used publicly available influenza A and B virus HA structures to project amino acid differences between the vaccine and the Thai strains. Comparing the circulating influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 with A/Michigan/45/2015 (vaccine strain since 2017), we identified N156K, L161I and S164T substitutions on the Sa antigenic site (Fig. 5A), which often drives A(H1N1)pdm09 evolution, particularly at residue 15613. We found that T185I, D187A, and Q189E mapped to the Sb antigenic site and overlapped the RBS, while S74R is on epitope Cb. No residue changes appeared on epitopes Ca1 nor Ca2.Figure 5Placement of residue changes identified in the influenza virus strains in this study. Trimeric HA of influenza A and B virus for which three-dimensional structures were available from the Protein Data Bank (https://www.rcsb.org) served to illustrate differences in amino acids at various positions between the vaccine and the Thai strains identified in this study. The AA changes were mapped by using PyMOL Molecular Graphics System Version 1.3 (Schrödinger; https://www.schrodinger.com). A) The AA changes between A/Michigan/45/2015 and A(H1N1)pdm09 Thai strains were mapped onto HA structure of A/California/04/2009 (PDB:3LZG). Amino acid substitutions of A(H3N2) Thai strains compared with B) A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (3C.2a) and C) A/Switzerland/9,715,293/2013 (3C.3a) were mapped on A/Victoria/361/2011 (PDB: 4WE9). D) Residue changes between B/Victoria Thai strains and vaccine strain, B/Brisbane/60/2008 (PDB: 4FQM) were shown. E) The AA changes of B/Yamagata Thai strains and B/Phuket/3073/2013 were mapped on B/Yamanashi/166/98 (PDB: 4M44). RBS and antigenic sites are color-coded. Residue of the vaccine strain, followed by the numerical position and the residue found in the Thai strains, are indicated with arrows pointing to the location (red). Bolded amino acid designations denote important antigenic and/or RBS, while blue designations are on HA2. Only one subunit comprising the trimeric HA is labeled for clarity.Full size imageUsing A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 as a representative A(H3N2) vaccine strain for clade 3C.2a, five residue changes mapped to antigenic epitope A (T131K, T135K, S137F, A138S, R142G/K), three residues mapped to epitope B (T128A, T160K, and L194P), one residue mapped to epitope C (H311Q), four residues mapped to epitope D (N96S, N121K, N171K, and A212T), and three residues mapped to epitope E (E62G, K92R, and R261Q) (Fig. 5B). Using A/Switzerland/9,715,293/2013 as a representative of A(H3N2) vaccine strain for subclade 3C.3a, which was the vaccine strain in 2015, four residue changes identified among the Thai strains were mapped onto the HA structure (S144K on site A, F193S on site B, N246E on site D, and S91N on site E) (Fig. 5C). Five residues at positions 135, 137, 138, 144 and 194 varied on the RBS. Overall, most circulating A(H3N2) strains showed dominant diversity on epitope sites A, B, D and E.On the HA structure of B/Brisbane/60/2008, circulating B/Victoria strains possessed substitutions at residues I117V, N129D, and K136E, which aggregate in the vicinity of the 120 loop region (Fig. 5D). Meanwhile, D197N which is a reversion of the substitution in the vaccine strain acquired as a result of egg-adaption was mapped to the 190 helix region. In contrast, none of the residue changes identified among the circulating B/Yamagata strains occurred on the antigenic or the RBS (Fig. 5E).Determination of the selection pressure on influenza virusAmino acid changes on the HA often result from selective pressure being exerted on the virus by the host immunity during infection. We therefore evaluated the potential positive selection of these residues by examining their rate of change (dN/dS) (Table S2). The relative rate of dN/dS for overall sites under positive selection on the HA1 region was 0.194 for A(H1N1)pdm09, 0.228 for A(H3N2), 0.657 for B/Victoria lineage, and 0.0525 for B/Yamagata lineage. These rates of < 1 implied purifying selection which eliminates or hinders the spread of deleterious mutations. Site-by-site selection analysis showed that two residues at HA1 positions 120 and 233 in A(H1N1)pdm09 circulating strains were under positive selection. Meanwhile, HA1 residues 57,131, 135, 144, and 193 were positively selected in A(H3N2). Although mixed effects model of evolution (MEME) algorithm yielded 10 positive sites in B/Victoria (76, 80, 87, 121, 126, 128, 136, 154, 160, and 238), only residue 238 was also identified by the fixed-effects likelihood (FEL) method. For B/Yamagata strains, only residue 227 was positively selected. This result indicate that more diversity and less purifying selection controls HA1.Implications on the computed antigenic relatednessWe next evaluated how the evolving changes on the HA residues potentially affected antigenic relatedness (Table S3-S5). Given the genetic sequence of the A(H1N1)pdm09 strains identified in this study compared to the vaccine strain A/Michigan/45/2015 (which remained unchanged from 2017–2019), the computed antigenic relatedness gradually decreased from 91.7% in 2017, 88.3% in 2018, and 74.2% in 2019 (Fig. 6). These findings suggest that the recent A(H1N1)pdm09 Thai strains identified in this study have significantly drifted from the vaccine sequence (p < 0.001). For the new 2020 season A(H1N1)pdm09 southern hemisphere vaccine strain A/Brisbane/02/2018, however, the computed antigenic relatedness was 78.5% (Fig. S3). Except for 2017, the vaccine component for southern hemisphere A(H3N2) has changed yearly. From 2017–2020, the computed antigenic relatedness for A(H3N2) were 44.7%, 43.6%, 9.2%, and − 18.9%. These values suggest that the A(H3N2) vaccine strain was a relatively poor match for the circulating strains in Thailand during the past four years (p < 0.01).Figure 6Estimation of the trend of computed antigenic relatedness between July 2017 and March 2020. Computed antigenic relatedness was derived using the Pepitope model by comparing vaccine strains and plotted by using R v3.6.0 (https://www.r-project.org). Circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were compared with A/Michigan/45/2015 (Mic15) and B/Brisbane/02/2018 (Bris18). Circulating A(H3N2) viruses were compared with A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (HK14), A/Singapore/INFIMH-16–0019/2016 (Sin16), A/Switzerland/8060/2017 (Swi17) and A/South Australia/34/2019 (SA19). The circulating B/Yamagata-like lineage was compared with B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Phu13) and the B/Victoria-like lineage was compared with B/Brisbane/60/2008 (B/Bris08), B/Colorado/06/2017 (B/Col17), B/Washington/02/2019 (B/Wa19) with the corresponding number of deletions. The colored circles of each panel represent individual computed antigenic relatedness against the vaccine strain in that year.Full size imageOn the other hand, the computed antigenic relatedness against the B/Victoria lineage strains for 2018 and 2019 were 94.9% and 85.8%, respectively (p < 0.001). For 2020, the chosen vaccine strain B/Washington/02/2019 demonstrated an improved antigenic relatedness of 94.8%. Finally, the fact that computed antigenic relatedness remains relatively high for the B/Yamagata vaccine strain B/Phuket/3073/2013 (94.2–100%), which has remained unchanged since 2015, suggests that the current vaccine strain remains appropriate. Taken together, computed antigenic relatedness estimates provided insight into the importance of the vaccine component match with the circulating influenza virus strains in the region.DiscussionYear-round influenza activity in Thailand can give rise to antigenically drifted influenza virus strains, which are sufficiently different to be categorized into emerging new subclades. These strains sometimes differ significantly from the vaccine strains and are able to escape the host immunity elicited by the annual influenza vaccine. Consequently, the effectiveness of influenza immunization is substantially reduced3,35. Our study aimed to characterize the predominantly circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2), as well as both lineages of the influenza B virus and how residue changes can affect the antigenic relatedness. Analysis of their HA gene sequence and deduced amino acids identified genetic heterogeneity, which were different from those found in the southern hemisphere vaccine strains for their respective years.Among the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus strains in this study, most amino acid substitutions contributing to the phylogenetic cluster transitions were accumulated at the antigenic sites Sa and Sb, while A(H3N2) demonstrated greater diversity with most mutations dominantly located on epitopes A, B, D and E. Meanwhile, antigenic drifts of the influenza B virus occurred at the 120 loop and the 190 helix. Observed changes on the antigenic and the RBS can be important since even one residue substitution at these sites could potentially drive new antigenic variants12,36.The computed antigenic relatedness based on the HA of A(H1N1)pdm09 decreased significantly in 2019 from the previous year. This suggests that most circulating influenza strains were antigenically different from the A/Michigan/45/2015 vaccine component for 2019 and the A/Brisbane/02/2018 vaccine component for 2020. The A(H1N1)pdm09 strains predominant in Thailand from 2010 to 2015 season belonged primarily to clade 6B.127, for which A/Michigan/45/2015 is a member and has served as the vaccine strain from 2017 to 2019. Since then, more recent A(H1N1)pdm09 strains have acquired S74R, S164T, and I295V, which have evolved into subclade 6B.1A17. Some strains with an additional S183P adjacent to the Sb antigenic site now form subclades 6B.1A1 to 6B.1A78. Several of the Thai A(H1N1)pdm09 circulating in 2018 are 6B.1A1 and 6B.1A6 strains, which is noteworthy since experimental studies have shown that serum from those immunized with the vaccine strain of clade 6B.1 was unable to efficiently neutralize influenza virus strain carrying S183P. This was why B/Brisbane/02/2018 (subclade 6B.1A1) was chosen for the 2020 flu season22. From 2019 onward, the majority of the A(H1N1)pdm09 Thai strains was 6B.1A5A, which was the predominant subclade in the 2018–2019 influenza season in Europe37. Several studies of vaccine estimates among all ages in 2018–2019 influenza season revealed that the predominant newly subclade was associated with a relatively low VE (A/Michigan/45/2015) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, which found in Europe (40–71%), USA( 30–58%), Canada (72%)38,39,40. Although B/Brisbane/02/2018 was used in the 2019–2020 influenza season for the northern hemisphere, low VE against A(H1N1)pdm09 has been observed in the USA (37%) and Europe (48–75%)41,42. Thus, 6B.1A5A strains in this study, however, possessed the additional D189E and either N156K or D187A. These changes, if continued, are expected to result in the introduction of a new strain component for the 2021 influenza vaccine.The computed antigenic relatedness for A(H3N2) during this study period, on the other hand, performed worse than A(H1N1)pdm09. This was not surprising given that the evolutionary rate for A(H3N2) in the HA1 domain is considerably greater than that for A(H1N1)pdm0943. Among several circulating A(H3N2), clade 3C.2a predominated since 201527 and has now accumulated sufficient changes to be classified as 3C.2a1 and 3C.2a217. Since then, 3C.2a1b was established, which has gained additional substitutions (either T131K or T135K with T128A) in HA1 and these changes are located in the antigenic and the RBS region7. The 3C.2a1b virus was also reportedly the predominant subclade in Europe for 2017–2018 winter month37. Due to multiple clades/subclades circulation, our study found the mismatch of the 2019 southern hemisphere vaccine (A/Switzerland/8060/2017 (subclade 3C.2a2)) and circulating strains in 2019 (3C.2a1b + T131K ). Furthermore, although A/South Australia/34/2019 which is a 3C.2a1b + T131K strain was announced for the 2020 southern hemisphere vaccine strain22, the predominate strains in the first three months of 2020 were subclade 3C.2a1b with additional T135K and T128A which slightly far away from their vaccine strain. T135K and T128A, which are located at antigenic sites A and B respectively, are predicted to cause a loss of glycosylation that might alter the HA antigenic properties and affect antibody recognition6. Further selective pressure analysis on the HA1 of A(H3N2) suggests that the residues changes at positions 131, 135, 144 and 193 have dN/dS ≥ 1 which indicated the positive selection due to immune escape mechanisms. Detection of clade 3C.3a strains in 2020 has been less frequent so far. A previous report showed that antibodies generated against 3C.2a less neutralize 3C.3a virus, particularly when 3C.3a possesses an additional F193S. It also does not neutralize 3C.2a1 well compared to 3C.2a244.The A(H3N2) vaccine strain was not effective during the 2018–19 influenza season in Europe, and low VE (− 58 to 57%) continues during 2019–20 season39,42. Our study also found that the computed antigenic relatedness against A(H3N2) was < 50% between 2019 and 2020 due to the circulation of multiple clades/subclades. These data suggested that the genetic diversity in A(H3N2) might hamper identification of a well-matched virus as a vaccine component in the 2014–2015 influenza season45 A meta-analysis indicated reduced protection and substantial variation of VE against A(H3N2). At the same time, the influenza vaccine provided moderate-to-high protection against A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B viruses35. Alternatives to egg-based manufacturing should proceed since a negative impact of egg-induced mutations in the H3N2 vaccine strain has been found46.Newly emerging influenza B/Victoria strains are antigenically distinct and possess either double deletion at residues 162–163 or triple deletion at residues 162–164 within the HA1 domain. In this study, the triple deletion strains were more commonly found than the ancestor B/Brisbane-like strain during the 2019–2020 season. New B/Victoria lineages are actively circulating and warrant changing vaccine strain recommendations for this lineage since 20188,17. Interim VE estimates of the 2019–2020 influenza season in the U.S. against the predominant B/Victoria lineage was 39–59% which showed a higher VE than influenza A virus41. This is consistent with a European study showing the VE of 62–83% against the influenza B virus for all ages during 2019–2020 season42. Our study also revealed a high computed antigenic relatedness against the new B/Victoria virus.Control measures to mitigate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have resulted in a decrease of influenza activity in 2020 thus far compared to the corresponding period of the previous year47,48,49. Monitoring influenza virus genetic drift remains critical in tracking novel residue changes, which could potentially affect virulence and evasion of host immunity.Our study had several limitations. First, there was no information on the vaccination status of the individuals with the samples sent to us for influenza virus testing. Second, the results for computed antigenic relatedness, which was assessed using the accumulated substitutions on antigenic sites, ideally would require additional confirmatory antigenic characterization such as hemagglutinin inhibition or virus neutralization assay in order to complement and strengthen our existing data. Finally, we did not investigate the genetic changes in the neuraminidase gene, which encodes a surface glycoprotein that is also immunogenic.By monitoring the genetic and antigenic changes of the influenza virus circulating in the tropics, data from this study suggests that new clades and subclades for both influenza A(H1N1)pmd09 and A(H3N2) viruses increasingly differ from those of the chosen vaccine strain, but not influenza B virus. These findings highlight the need for improved vaccine strain match particularly for A(H3N2).

The aim of this study was to investigate the broad spectrum antiviral activity of a naturally existing sulfated polysaccharide, lambda-carrageenan (λ-CGN), purified from marine red algae. Cell culture-based assays revealed that the macromolecule efficiently inhibited both influenza A and B viruses with EC50 values ranging from 0.3 to 1.4 μg/ml, as well as currently circulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with an EC50 value of 0.9 ± 1.1 μg/ml. No toxicity to the host cells was observed at concentrations up to 300 μg/ml. Plaque titration and western blot analysis verified that λ-CGN reduced expression of viral proteins in cell lysates and suppressed progeny virus production in culture supernatants in a dose-dependent manner. This polyanionic compound exerts antiviral activity by targeting viral attachment to cell surface receptors and preventing virus entry. Moreover, its intranasal administration to mice during influenza A viral challenge not only alleviated infection-mediated reductions in body weight but also protected 60% of mice from virus-induced mortality. Thus, λ-CGN could be a promising antiviral agent for preventing infection with several respiratory viruses.

The diverse chemical structure and the degree of sulfation divides CGNs into three major polysaccharide groups, kappa (κ)-, iota (ι)- and lambda (λ)-CGNs, which contain one, two, and three negatively-charged sulfate ester groups per disaccharide repeating unit, respectively1. These natural polymers of diverse molecular weights have been used widely as pharmaceutical delivery vehicles to facilitate drug formulation or sustained drug release. As biomolecules, CGNs have various biological activities, including anticoagulant, anti-tumoral, or immunomodulatory functions2,3. Several reports suggest that CGNs show in vitro or in vivo activity against rhinovirus, enterovirus 71, dengue virus, human herpes simplex, African swine fever virus, and influenza A virus4,5,6,7,8,9,10. Most of these antiviral efficacy studies have focused on κ- and ι-CGNs; only one study suggested that λ-CGN was a potent inhibitor of rabies virus infection11. Based on the structural characteristics of λ-CGN, by which it has no 3,6-anhydro-d-galactopyranosyl linkage but contains a higher sulfate content compared to the two other sulfated polysaccharides (Fig. 1A), we wondered whether it is active against different respiratory viruses: influenza A and B viruses and severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Figure 1Inhibition of influenza virus infection by λ-CGN in vitro. (A) Chemical structure of the repeating disaccharide unit in λ-CGN. (B) Western blot analysis showing expression of viral proteins. MDCK cells infected with PR8 at an MOI of 0.001 were mock-treated (Mock) or treated with 10 μM of OSV-C or with increasing concentrations of λ-CGN or p-KG03 at 35 °C. On the next day, cell lysates were harvested for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-NP or anti-HA antibodies. β-Actin was used as a loading control. ‘No virus’ means negative control without viral infection.

The graph was created using GraphPad Prism 8.3.1 (www.graphpad.com).Full size imageInfluenza virus is a major human respiratory virus that causes seasonal epidemics or unexpected pandemic outbreaks. It belongs to the family Orthomyxoviridae and contains an eight-segmented, negative-sense RNA genome classified into three types, A, B and C. Type A is further divided into subtypes based on the serological characteristics of surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), while type B is split into Victoria and Yamagata lineages. Even though therapeutic antivirals such as oseltamivir phosphate, zanamivir, peramivir and baloxavir marboxyl, as well as preventative vaccines, have been successfully developed, emerging drug-resistant strains and mismatch-derived inefficacy of vaccines mean that this virus still threatens human public health, resulting in an estimated annual mortality burden of 290,000 to 650,000 deaths12,13,14.Coronavirus, a member of the family Coronaviridae, is also an enveloped virus with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome of 26 to 32 kilobases in length. Similar to influenza virus, it is a zoonotic virus that causes respiratory disease in humans. Most infections have been related to mild symptoms such as fever, fatigue, or dry cough. However, recently emerging viruses have become more lethal and highly contagious. For example, SARS-CoV, first identified in 2003, had a mortality rate of 10%, with over 8000 laboratory-confirmed cases, whereas Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), identified in 2012, had a mortality rate of 34%, with 2494 cases15,16. In comparison to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 has a lower fatality rate (about 9% compared with SARS-CoV-1); however, it has caused a global pandemic, with over forty-four million confirmed cases and 1178 thousand deaths as of November 2020 recorded since December 201917. Despite this formidable circulation, we still have no coronavirus-specific antivirals. Because the symptoms and transmission routes of these respiratory viruses are very similar, a broad spectrum antiviral agent is required for their co-treatment. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the antiviral activity of λ-CGN against influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 and to identify its mechanism of action.Experimental sectionCells, viruses, and compoundsMadin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, African green monkey kidney cells (both Vero and Vero E6) and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 T cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Cat. Nos., CCL-34, CCL-81, CRL-1586 and CRL-3216, respectively; ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). MDCK cells were maintained in minimum essential medium (MEM; HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Atlas Biologicals, Fort Collins, CO, USA). Other cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; HyClone) supplemented with 10% FBS. Influenza viruses A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8; H1N1), A/Hong Kong/8/68 (HK; H3N2), and B/Lee/40 (Lee) were purchased from the ATCC. The mouse-adapted PR8 (maPR8) strain was a kind gift from Prof. H. J. Kim (Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea). Influenza A viruses were inoculated into 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs at 37 °C for 3 days, whereas influenza B virus was amplified at 35 °C for 3 days in MDCK cells in the presence of 2 μg/ml tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). SARS-CoV-2 (BetaCoV/Korea/KCDC03/2020), provided by Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was amplified in Vero cells at 37 °C for 3 days. After centrifugation at 1000g for 5 min, viral stocks were stored at − 80 °C and viral titers were determined in a plaque assay18. The test compound λ-CGN, average molecular weight 1025 kDa, was purchased from DuPont Nutrition & Biosciences (Wilmington, DE, USA). Control anti-influenza viral agents amantadine hydrochloride (AMT; ≥ 98%), ribavirin (RBV; ≥ 98%) and (–)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG; ≥ 95%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Oseltamivir carboxylate (OSV-C) was purchased from United States Biological (Swampscott, MA, USA). Marine microalgae-derived sulfated polysaccharide p-KG03 was purified and characterized by Dr. Joung Han Yim (Korea Polar Research Institute, Incheon, Republic of Korea)19. Oseltamivir phosphate (OSV-P; ≥ 98%) for in vivo antiviral studies was obtained from Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co. (Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea). Remdesivir (RDV; 99.74%), a control anti-SARS-CoV-2 compound, was purchased from MedChem Express (Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA).Cell culture-based antiviral assayAn antiviral assay for influenza viruses was performed as described previously20. Briefly, MDCK cells grown overnight in 96-well plates (3 × 104 cells per well) were mock-infected or infected with each viral strain at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 at 35 °C for 1 h. After removing unabsorbed virus, cells were treated with threefold dilutions of each compound for 3 days at the same temperature. Viability of non-infected or infected cells was measured using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) to determine the half-maximal cytotoxic concentration (CC50) and the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50), respectively.To assess anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in an image-based system, Vero cells were grown overnight in 96-well plates (2 × 104 cells per well). After addition of serial threefold dilutions of compounds, cells were infected with an equal volume of SARS-CoV-2 (MOI of 0.05) at 37 °C for 2 days within a biosafety level 3 laboratory. The cells were fixed and permeabilized with chilled acetone:methanol (1:3) for probing with an anti-spike antibody (Genetex, Irvine, CA, USA) followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) to determine EC50 values. Cell nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Invitrogen) to calculate the CC50 values. The number of viral spike protein-derived or cell nuclei-derived signals detected in four spots per well was quantified from three independent samples using the Operetta high content screening system (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) and the built-in Harmony High-Content Imaging and Analysis software 3.5.2. For determination of 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50), SARS-CoV-2-infected cells were incubated in the absence or presence of antiviral compounds for 2 days. Fresh Vero cells seeded in 96-well plates were infected with serial tenfold dilutions of the culture supernatants for additional 2 days. TCID50s were determined by counting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-derived green fluorescence population as well as the number of DAPI-derived nuclei distribution as mentioned above.Western blot analysisFor anti-influenza viral study, PR8-infected MDCK cells (MOI, 0.001) were treated with increasing concentrations of λ-CGN, pKG-03 or OSV-C at 35 °C for 1 day. For antiviral analysis against SARS-CoV-2, virus-infected Vero cells (MOI, 0.005) were treated with increasing concentrations of λ-CGN or RDV at 37 °C for 2 days. Culture lysates were harvested and loaded onto 10 or 12% SDS-PAGE gels (40 μg total protein per well) for electrotransfer. Influenza viral NP and HA proteins were detected using mouse anti-NP (Cat. No., 11675-MM03; Sino Biological, Beijing, China) and rabbit anti-HA2 (Cat. No., 86001-RM01; Sino Biological) antibodies, respectively, according to our previous report18. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was probed with the mouse anti-spike antibody. Cellular β-actin used as a loading control was detected with a mouse anti-β-actin antibody (Cat. No., A1987; Sigma-Aldrich). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were used to detect the primary antibodies (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). After addition of a chemiluminescent HRP substrate (SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate; Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA), images were obtained using a LAS-4000 Luminescent Image Analyzer (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan).Plaque titrationPlaque reduction assay was performed as described previously, with some modifications18. Briefly, MDCK cells seeded in 6-well plates were infected with PR8 at an MOI of 0.001 in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of λ-CGN or p-KG03. On the next day, the culture supernatants were harvested and serial tenfold dilutions were used for infection of fresh MDCK cells in 48-well plates. After their incubation in overlay medium [serum-free MEM with 1.2% Avicel RC-591 (FMC Corp, Philadelphia, PA, USA) and 2 μg/ml TPCK-trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich)] at 33 °C for 3 days, the number of plaques was counted by crystal violet staining.Time-of-addition experimentsMDCK cells were seeded in 48-well plates at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells per well for 1 day. In the pre-treatment assay, λ-CGN (1 μg/ml) was treated for 2 h followed by PBS-washing and infection with PR8 at an MOI of 0.001 for additional 2 h. In the co-treatment assay, the mixture of λ-CGN and PR8 were loaded onto the cells immediately or after 30-min-preincubation. In the post-treatment assay, λ-CGN was added for 2 h after infection with PR8 for 2 h. As controls, p-KG03 (1 μg/ml) or EGCG (1 μM) was treated in all sets. In each step, cells were washed with PBS to remove non-specifically bound compounds or unabsorbed virus. The cells were cultured at 33 °C for 3 days in the overlay medium for plaque titration19.HA inhibition assayEqual volumes (25 μl) of two-fold dilutions of PR8 (HA titer of the stock, 28) and increasing concentrations of λ-CGN were incubated for 20 min at room temperature in 96-well round bottom plates. In each well, 50 μl of 0.5% chicken red blood cells (RBCs) was added. After 30 min incubation, HA titers were determined by RBC agglutination21.Confocal microscopyMDCK cells were infected with PR8 virus at an MOI of 5 in the absence or presence of the sulfated polysaccharides (10 μg/ml) for 4 h at 37 °C. In parallel, the same samples were incubated for 2.5 h at 37 °C with protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) (CHX; Sigma-Aldrich), of which experimental condition was optimized in our previous reports18,22. Viral NP was visualized using an anti-NP antibody (Cat. No., sc-80481; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen), while nuclear DNA was counterstained using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Images were captured under a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope and data were analyzed with ZEN blue software 3.1 (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY, USA).In vivo studyAntiviral efficacy study in a mouse model was performed by modification of our previous report18. Briefly, female BALB/c mice (6–7 weeks old; Orient Bio Inc., Gyeonggi-do, Republic Korea) were infected with maPR8. Five units of 50% mouse lethal dose (5 MLD50) of the virus were preincubated with λ-CGN for 30 min at room temperature. Mice were challenged intranasally with maPR8 alone or with maPR8 mixed with λ-CGN (1 or 5 mg/kg) in a total volume of 50 μl. The control group received OSV-P orally from days 0 to 5 post-infection [10 mg/kg/day (b.i.d.)] beginning 4 h before virus challenge. Changes in body weight and mortality were measured every day for 15 days. Mice were sacrificed when they lost at least 25% of their body weight. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with ethical guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT). All experimental protocols were approved by the KRICT’s IACUC with the code number of 2020-6D-04-01. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were constructed using GraphPad Prism 8.3.1 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).Pseudovirus production and neutralization assayPseudotyped viruses were prepared by transfecting 293T cells with following plasmids: encoding HIV-1 genome (gag/pol) together with glycoprotein(s) of each virus (pCAGGS-Influenza A (H1N1) HA together with pCAGGS-Influenza A (H1N1) NA, or pCAGGS-SARS-CoV-2-spike), and the firefly luciferase (pQCXIP-fLuc). Transfection was performed with PEIpro (Polyplus-transfection, Illkrich, France) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Culture media were changed with fresh DMEM at 24 h after transfection and supernatants containing pseudovirus were harvested after 24 h of additional incubation.For neutralization assay, Vero E6 cells were infected with each influenza A (H1N1) HA/NA- or SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped viruses. Before induction, pseudoviruses were incubated with λ-CGN for 2 h. Particularly, influenza A (H1N1) HA/NA pseudovirus was treated with 10 μg/ml of TPCK treated-trypsin for 15 min before λ-CGN treatment. After that, TPCK treated-trypsin was inactivated by 10 μg/ml Soybean solution (Sigma-Aldrich). Twenty four hours after infection, the medium was changed with fresh DMEM. Forty eight hours after transduction, BrightGlo (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was added to the cell lysates according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and relative luminescence units (RLUs) were measured by a microplate reader.Quantitative RT-PCRSARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells (MOI, 0.005) were treated with increasing concentrations of λ-CGN or RDV at 37 °C. At day 2, culture supernatants were harvested for viral RNA purification using QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Relative SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies were quantified using a real-time RT-PCR kit with an N gene-specific primer set (PCLMD nCoV one step RT-PCR kit; PCL Inc., Seoul, Republic of Korea) and a CFX96 Touch real-time PCR instrument (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).Statistical analysisStatistical analyses were performed by unpaired, two-way ANOVA t-test according to the Dunnett’s multiple comparison method using GraphPad Prism version 8.3.1. In the Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, survival statistics were calculated by Log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test. P values lower than to 0.05 were considered statistically significant. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ****P < 0.0001.ResultsAnti-influenza activity of λ-CGNTo examine the antiviral activity of λ-CGN, increasing concentrations of the compound were loaded to influenza virus-infected MDCK cells. Another sulfated polysaccharide, p-KG03, of which antiviral activity has been elucidated in our previous report19 and three different antiviral chemicals (AMT, RBV and OSV-C) were used as controls. The anti-influenza viral activity or the drug-resistance profiles of these control compounds were reproducible, indicating that the cell culture-based antiviral assay is reliable (Table 1). The cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay revealed that λ-CGN efficiently inhibited infection by both influenza A and B viruses, with EC50 values of 0.3 to 1.4 μg/ml, with no cytotoxicity up to a maximum concentration of 300 μg/ml. Notably, the inhibitory effect was comparable with that of p-KG03. To confirm this finding, we measured changes in viral protein expression in cell lysates and infectious viral titers in culture supernatants (Fig. 1B,C, Supplementary Fig. S1). The data revealed that λ-CGN not only inhibited expression of viral proteins NP and HA in infected cells, but also suppressed production of progeny virus in a dose-dependent manner as observed in the p-KG03-treated samples. Taken together, these results suggested that λ-CGN has considerable antiviral activity against influenza A and B viruses in vitro, with selectivity index (SI) values over 263.2.Table 1 Antiviral effect of λ-CGN against influenza A and B viruses.Full size tableInhibition of influenza viral entry by λ-CGNWe wondered which step of the influenza virus life cycle is targeted by λ-CGN. Using p-KG03 and EGCG as controls for blocking virus entry, λ-CGN was treated at different time points, such as before (pre-treatment), during (co-treatment) or after (post-treatment) viral infection at 2 h intervals (Fig. 2A). Plaque titration informed that its pre-treatment has little inhibitory effect, while post-treatment resulted in significant reduction but not remarkable (Fig. 2B). However, its co-treatment with the virus induced significant antiviral effect, that was more enhanced when they were pre-incubated for 30 min before treatment. All three compounds seem to target viral entry step by directly attenuating infectivity of the viral particles. The result suggested that λ-CGN could interact with a viral protein important for virus entry, possibly HA.Figure 2Time-of-addition experiment. (A) Schematic representation of compound treatment and virus infection. In the pre-treatment assay, MDCK cells were treated with λ-CGN (1 μg/ml) for 2 h and then infected with PR8 at an MOI of 0.001 for additional 2 h. In the co-treatment assay, the mixture of λ-CGN and PR8 was loaded onto the cells immediately or after 30-min-preincubation [Co-treatment (− 30 min)]. In the post-treatment assay, PR8-infected cells were added with λ-CGN for 2 h. As controls, p-KG03 (1 μg/ml) or EGCG (1 μM) was treated in all sets. In each step, cells were washed with PBS to remove non-specifically bound compounds or unabsorbed virus. (B) Plaque titration. The cells treated with compounds and PR8 at different time points were incubated in the overlay medium. At day 3 post-infection, viral plaques were counted in comparison to the mock-treated controls (set at 100%). Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ****P < 0.0001; n.d., not detected. Pre, pre-treatment of the compound; Co, co-treatment of the compound with virus; Co (− 30), co-treatment with 30 min-preincubated samples; post, post-treatment of the compound. The graph was created using GraphPad Prism 8.3.1 (www.graphpad.com).Full size imageTo evaluate this hypothesis, we examined HA inhibition assay with λ-CGN (Fig. 3A). Agglutination of chicken RBC was achieved by PR8 at the highest dilution 28. However, HA titer was gradually reduced as the concentration of λ-CGN was increased, confirming that it inhibits binding of viral HA to cellular receptors. To further verify its mode-of-action, intracellular distribution of viral NP was compared in the absence or presence of the compound at 4 h p.i, a time when NP was fully localized to the nuclei for robust replication of viral RNA (Fig. 3B, Supplementary Fig. S2). The confocal microscopic images revealed that, similar to p-KG03, λ-CGN reduced the number of NP-positive nuclei when compared to the mock-treated sample. We also monitored the intracellular distribution of NP at an earlier time point (2.5 h post-infection) in the presence of CHX, a protein synthesis inhibitor that allows tracking of the input viral proteins and their localization (Fig. 3C). Under this condition, when NP was present in the cytoplasm but not reached the nucleus, λ-CGN completely blocked membrane penetration of the viral particles harboring vRNP complexes as efficiently as p-KG03. No NP accumulation on the surface of the cellular membrane strongly suggests that λ-CGN targets attachment of influenza virus to its cell surface receptors by neutralizing viral glycoprotein HA.Figure 3Effect of λ-CGN on the influenza A virus entry. (A) HA inhibition assay. Two-fold serially diluted PR8 (from 23 to 211) in PBS was incubated with an equal volume of PBS or twofold increasing concentrations of λ-CGN for 20 min. HA titer in each combination was determined at 30 min after addition of 0.5% chicken RBC. HA titers are marked on the right side of the panel. (B,C) Confocal microscopy. MDCK cells were infected with PR8 (MOI, 5) in the absence (Mock) or presence of either λ-CGN or p-KG03 at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. At 4 h post-infection in the absence of CHX (B) or at 2.5 h in the presence of 10 μg/ml CHX (C), viral NP was detected with an anti-NP antibody and an Alex Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (green). Cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). Original magnification, 400×. The images were analyzed using ZEN blue software 3.1 (www.zeiss.com).Full size imageProtection of mice from influenza A viral infection by λ-CGNTo investigate the antiviral activity of λ-CGN in vivo, mice were infected intranasally with maPR8 alone or with maPR8 plus λ-CGN once. As a control, maPR8-infected mice received OSV-P orally twice a day for 6 days. Antiviral activity was determined by monitoring body weight and mortality for 15 days. The results revealed that maPR8 at 5 MLD50 caused body weight loss (Fig. 4A) and complete death within day 7 (Fig. 4B). Notably, intranasal administration of 5 mg/kg λ-CGN mitigated infection-mediated body weight loss, yielding a 60% survival rate. However, this antiviral efficacy was not observed at a lower dose (1 mg/kg). As expected, treatment with OSV-P at 10 mg/kg/day for 6 days showed remarkable therapeutic effects, ensuring the reliability of the in vivo antiviral study. Taken together, these data suggested that intranasal co-administration of λ-CGN prevents viral infection-mediated body weight loss and reduces mortality.Figure 4Antiviral effect of λ-CGN against influenza A virus in vivo. BALB/c mice (6–7 weeks old female) were mock-infected (black) or intranasally infected with maPR8 at 5 MLD50 (red). As test groups, the virus was preincubated at room temperature for 30 min with λ-CGN at a lower dose (1 mg/kg/d, purple) or a higher dose (5 mg/kg/d, green), followed by intranasal administration. Control mice received OSV-P orally twice a day (10 mg/kg/d) at 8-h intervals, starting at 4 h before viral infection (blue). Body weight (A) and mortality (B) of mice were measured every day from days 0 to 14 post-infection. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. from five mice. Survival statistics were calculated by Log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test. **P < 0.01; n.s., non-statistically significant. The graphs were created using GraphPad Prism 8.3.1 (www.graphpad.com).Full size imageAnti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of λ-CGNTo address whether λ-CGN can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 as well as influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2 spike- and influenza A (H1N1) HA/NA-pseudotyped viruses bearing a firefly luciferase reporter gene were prepared23. Firefly luciferase assay with their infected cell lysates revealed that λ-CGN is able to suppress entry of both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A viral glycoproteins-derived pseudoviruses in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5). As a next step, we examined antiviral activity of the sulfated polysaccharide against infectious SARS-CoV-2. Vero cells infected with the virus at an MOI of 0.02 were treated with increasing concentrations of λ-CGN by using RDV as a control. On day 2, immunofluorescence microscopy with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody revealed that viral infection was inhibited effectively by λ-CGN, without affecting cell viability (Fig. 6A). As expected, anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity was well induced in the RDV-treated cells. Quantitative analysis of antiviral dose–response and cell viability showed that λ-CGN had an EC50 of 0.9 ± 1.1 μg/ml and a CC50 of > 300.0 μg/ml (resulting in an S.I., > 333.3), while RDV had an EC50 of 23.5 ± 1.2 μM and a CC50 of > 300.0 μM (resulting in an S.I., > 12.8) (Fig. 6B). In addition, western blot and quantitative RT-PCR analyses exhibited decreases of both viral protein in cell lysate and viral RNA level in the culture supernatants by the sulfated polysaccharide (Fig. 7A,B, Supplementary Fig. S3). Decisively, reinfection of the culture supernatants into fresh Vero cells confirmed reduction of infectious viral titers in the presence of λ-CGN as observed in RDV (Fig. 7C). These results strongly demonstrate that λ-CGN is active against SARS-CoV-2.Figure 5Inhibition of infection by influenza A virus (H1N1) HA/NA- or SARS-CoV-2 spike-pseudotyped viruses. Lentiviral pseudotypes bearing influenza A virus (H1N1) HA and NA proteins (black bars) or SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (gray bars) were prepared, in which a firefly luciferase-expressing plasmid was incorporated. They were preincubated with mock or increasing concentrations of λ-CGN for 2 h at 37 °C and then infected into Vero E6 cells. On day 2, relative firefly luciferase activity (RLU) was determined by fixing the mock-treated sample at 100%. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. ****P < 0.0001.

On day 2 post-infection, cells were fixed and permeabilized prior to immunostaining with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody and an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (green).

These studies of the physiochemical properties and molecular structure of these compounds reveal that the antiviral efficacy is mainly due to their affinity for viral glycoproteins, resulting in blockade of viral attachment to cellular receptors. Accordingly, it is convincing that the charge density, chain length, degree of sulfation, and detailed structural features of these macromolecules are critical for this interaction. In-depth studies of the underlying mechanisms demonstrated that the macromolecules exert anti-HIV activity by competing with polyanionic regions of host-cell-surface molecules for binding to the positively charged amino acids present in the viral enveloped glycoprotein, gp120, including the V3 loop29,30,31. The microbicidal activity of polystyrene sulfonate against sexually transmitted infectious diseases caused by herpes simplex virus type 2 and papillomavirus has been evaluated in vivo and in vitro32,33. Unfortunately, prevention of vaginal HIV transmission using topical cellulose sulfate gel failed34, indicating the need for development of a more potent microbicidal sulfated polysaccharide or for administration of the polymers through an alternative route, such as oral or intranasal.Regarding this issue, it is not strange to anticipate that intranasal treatment with active sulfated polysaccharides could be a promising way to prevent infection by various respiratory enveloped viruses such as influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and coronaviruses. Previously, it was reported that κ-CGN with a molecular weight of 2 kDa is active against influenza A virus in vitro, with an EC50 value of 32.1 μg/ml. In addition, ι-CGN inhibited influenza A virus infection of MDCK cells with an EC50 value of 0.04–0.20 μg/ml; not only that, intranasal administration of ι-CGN showed therapeutic effects in an influenza A virus-infected mouse model4,35. Notably, a randomized double-blind study in volunteers with early symptoms of the common cold confirmed the efficacy and safety of an antiviral ι-CGN nasal spray36. In contrast to κ- and ι-CGNs, the antiviral activity of λ-CGN has rarely been investigated in the context of viral species that are transmitted in droplets or through the air. Therefore, we explored whether λ-CGN is able to inhibit both influenza A and B viruses and/or the emerging SARS-CoV-2. We had a great interest in λ-CGN, because this compound comprising alternating (1,3)-linked α-D-galactose-2-sulfated and (1,4)-linked β-D-galactose-2,6,-disulfated units has a higher degree sulfation with an ester sulfate content of about 32–39% and shows better solubility in cold water than the other two CGNs37. Accordingly, the sulfated polysaccharide was expected to have efficient and broad antiviral activity and to be easily dissolved in an aqueous solution when it is formulated for a nasal spray.Here, we successfully observed that λ-CGN inhibits not only influenza viruses but also SARS-CoV-2 by targeting their entry process. Strikingly, its virucidal properties led to a 60% survival rate in virus-challenged mice after an exposure of infectious virus to the antiviral agent (Fig. 4). However, it remains to be investigated whether this polyanionic compound is able to protect small animals such as hACE2-expressing mice or Syrian hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 infection by blocking the viral S protein-associated entry step38,39. In addition, because CGNs have intrinsic anti-coagulant activity, any unwarranted side effects should be reviewed before clinical application. This is because dysfunctional or aberrant coagulation is responsible for the hyper-inflammatory responses observed in severe cases of influenza or SARS-CoV-2 infection-mediated pneumonia, and anti-coagulant signals could be over-stimulated already in the lungs of infected patients40,41. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to suggest that λ-CGN potently inhibits infection by influenza B as well as influenza A viruses and emerging SARS-CoV-2. The broad spectrum antiviral activity of this compound would make it valuable especially when different respiratory viruses are circulating concurrently or when their prophylactic treatment is definitely required before diagnosis.

Updated: 3:16 PM EST Jan 11, 2021 The sorts of things we look for are is a change in a part of the virus that we think is important to target with the vaccine and is the change in a place in the virus. We think it might change the virus to lead the virus to do something we don't like, like transmit more easily. And the reason we focused on this, um, particular and 51 y mutation is it met both criteria. You get syrah from people who've been vaccinated. The antibodies that are in that Sarah, is the thing that you hope of protecting them against infection. You find out if those anybody specifically block the mutant virus or not, that's what you do. That would be testing the impact on the vaccine going forward. We're going to be need to do many Mawr experiments as new variants come out. Not just looking. Single mutations booking all the combinations of mutations out there as well. So So this is not the end of the story.

Jeffrey Greenberg Getty ImagesBy mid-December, the Northern Hemisphere is usually well into the start of its annual cold and flu season—but so far this year, even as the COVID-19 pandemic surges in dozens of countries, the levels of many common seasonal infections remain extremely low.The pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has infected at least 67 million people and killed 1.5 million worldwide. The patchwork of responses intended to fight the pandemic—from temporary lockdowns to mask wearing, social distancing, enhanced personal hygiene and reduced travel—has had a huge impact on other common respiratory illnesses, too.In the Southern Hemisphere—now past its winter—seasonal influenza hardly struck at all. That looks as though it might happen in the north, too. Conversely, some common-cold viruses have thrived, and tantalizing evidence suggests that they might, in some cases, protect against COVID-19.On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

Scientists hope this year’s disrupted seasons could reveal new information about the transmission and behaviour of these unwelcome annual guests: how these viruses respond to health measures, how they interact and what that might mean for long-term disease burdens. “This is a natural experiment for so many respiratory viruses,” says Sonja Olsen, an epidemiologist at the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, part of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia.The influenza fizzleIn May, at the tail end of the first wave of COVID-19 deaths in many nations, and when some of the strictest lockdowns were in place, health workers noted an abrupt and early halt to the 2019–20 flu season in the Northern Hemisphere.That might partly have been an artefact caused by fewer people coming to a clinic for testing, experts say, but it was also attributable to the effectiveness of policies such as social distancing. After the pandemic started, positive tests for the flu virus plummeted by 98% in the United States, for example, whereas the number of samples submitted for testing dropped by only 61%. In the end, the US 2019–20 flu season was rated as ‘moderate’ by the CDC, which estimates that 38 million people fell ill with influenza, and 22,000 people died. That’s fewer than in recent years, but not unprecedented.After the flu season in the north ended early, it hardly got going at all in the Southern Hemisphere. There were astonishingly few cases of seasonal flu there from April to July 2020—even as global COVID-19 cases continued to climb. In Australia, Chile and South Africa, a grand total of just 51 cases of flu were spotted in more than 83,000 tests. “We know it’s less transmissible than coronavirus, so it makes sense,” says Olsen, but the decline was still “greater than expected”. Influenza’s absence has been attributed to pandemic-response measures, but they don’t tell the whole story.“Some South American countries haven’t done such a good job controlling COVID, but even there flu is low,” says virologist Richard Webby at St Jude’s hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. “I don’t think we can put it all down to mask wearing and social distancing.” He suspects that the dearth of international travel played a part. Flu typically travels around the world from one winter to another, while maintaining a lower year-round presence in the tropics. Although the mechanisms underlying this behaviour aren’t entirely clear, the movement of people clearly contributes. Enhanced school cleaning might have reduced the spread of some viruses, but others persist. Credit: Oli Scarff Getty Images Increased influenza vaccination might have contributed to the disappearance, too. Australia, for example, saw more than 7.3 million flu jabs administered by 20 May 2020, compared with 4.5 million by that date in 2019, and 3.5 million in 2018. It’s unclear if that trend will hold in the north.Vaccination rates in the United States for seasonal flu have been trending upwards for years: slightly more than half of the US population over six months of age was vaccinated in 2019–20, up 2.6 percentage points from the previous year. But it is unclear whether Americans will be more or less inclined towards flu vaccinations this year, particularly given the tumultuous backdrop of the pandemic and the change in president.Viral unknownsMost experts are cautiously betting on a very mild flu season for the Northern Hemisphere this year. That would be good news on many fronts—in particular, it would help to alleviate the potential burden on the health system, from hospitals to testing centres, caused by simultaneous waves of flu and COVID-19. But surprises could be in store.No one really knows, for example, why one nation, such as Australia, can be hit hard by influenza for several years while a neighbouring country, such as New Zealand, sees very low rates, says Webby. Even influenza’s seasonality isn’t entirely understood, nor exactly how it travels around the globe. “We don’t have a real good handle on why it’s a winter disease,” he says. Untangling lessons about flu from this year’s data will be interesting but difficult, Olsen says, because pandemic policies and compliance vary on the national, state and even neighbourhood level.And the changing trends could have consequences. If this year’s flu season does fizzle out in the Northern Hemisphere, that could make it harder to predict the right strains to put in 2021’s flu vaccine. It could also have intriguing, longer-term consequences. Webby speculates that a low-flu season might kill off less-common variants of influenza. “A lot of different flus have been circulating in recent years. Are they all going to make it out of this or not?” he asks. “It’s possible that what this season will do is actually make the virological picture a lot simpler. That may be permanent, potentially.”At the same time, Webby adds, the lack of viral competition in human hosts could conceivably open a door for new swine-flu variants in the future. “We get a handful of those every year, in the agricultural-fair season,” Webby says. “One of the things holding those viruses back a lot is natural immunity. If flu is low for a few seasons, that might leave a gap for swine viruses to have more impact.”“I am sure that flu will come back with a vengeance at some stage in the future,” says Robert Ware, a clinical epidemiologist at Griffith University in Queensland, Australia, “but it might take a few years.”Bucking the trendInfluenza viruses aren’t the only ones affected by pandemic-response measures. There are hundreds of viruses that cause respiratory symptoms similar to those of a common cold, from parainfluenza to metapneumovirus. And most of these viruses, too, seem to have been held at bay in the Southern Hemisphere’s winter.In particular, researchers saw some abrupt declines in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a common virus that typically infects young children and can sometimes cause serious conditions such as pneumonia. There is no vaccine for RSV, and the virus causes about 5% of deaths in children under five around the world. In Western Australia, RSV in children declined by 98% (and flu by 99.4%) through their winter 2020, even though schools were open.The RSV reprieve might be only temporary, though. Data from Australia’s most populous region, New South Wales (NSW), for example, show RSV detections climbing back up in October. And a build-up of susceptible, uninfected children might result in bigger waves of infection in future, some researchers warn. Credit: Nature, https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-020-03519-3; Sources: UK: ref. 4; NSW: NSW ministry of Health There is one major exception to the downward viral trend. “The one virus that’s not being halted is the rhinovirus,” says Janet Englund, a paediatric infectious disease researcher at Seattle Children’s Hospital in Washington. Rhinoviruses are the major cause of the common cold, especially in children. More than a hundred strains exist, and about a dozen typically circulate in any given community. In one study in Southampton, UK, rhinovirus detection in adults admitted to hospital remained lower over the summer of 2020 than in summer 2019, but shot up as usual once schools reopened in September. Data from NSW likewise show an apparent surge in rhinoviruses over the southern winter. Although some of these peaks are probably due to an increase in testing in people with mild cold symptoms, these viruses certainly did not decline as others did.“No one really knows why” rhinoviruses are proving so persistent, says Englund. Some viruses that cause cold-like symptoms are very different from each other in structure; in particular, rhinoviruses, unlike influenza and coronaviruses, don’t have an outer lipid coat, or envelope, which is vulnerable to soaps and sanitizers. In NSW, detection of the non-enveloped adenoviruses, which also cause cold-like symptoms, held relatively steady throughout the southern winter, rather than crashing like flu or surging like rhinovirus. “The expectation is that rhinovirus is perhaps more stable on surfaces,” Englund says, allowing greater transmission between children on hands, desks and doorknobs. There is also thought to be greater asymptomatic transmission of rhinoviruses, which would allow them to circulate more freely in schools, even when sick children are staying at home.The good news is that the common cold might help to protect people against COVID‑19. One study of more than 800,000 people, for example, showed that adults who had had cold symptoms within the previous year were less likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2—although why this is so remains a mystery.Cross-protection?One possible explanation is that previous infection with a coronavirus (another cause of the common cold) could confer some immunity to SARS-CoV-2—although it’s notable that people can get the same coronavirus colds over and over again, and multiple cold viruses at once. Previous coronavirus infections do seem to generate T cells and B cells—immune-system cells that help to attack and remember pathogens—that can recognize SARS-CoV-2. These pre-existing cells might provide some partial cross-protection against the new coronavirus.A few studies have shown that, because of other coronavirus infections, about one-quarter of people have antibodies that can bind to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, says Scott Hensley, a viral immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. One study showed that these antibodies can actually neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infections, stopping the virus from invading cells. Strong cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by antibodies against other coronaviruses would be “really spectacular”, says Qiuwei Abdullah Pan at Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, because it would open the door to universal coronavirus vaccines that protect across the board. But other studies, including Hensley’s, found that these antibodies cannot neutralize SARS-CoV-2 or protect against COVID-19. “Cross-neutralization has not been proven,” says Pan. Even if it is, he says, “I would expect the activity would probably be very moderate.”Another way that seasonal colds might be contributing to COVID-19 immunity is that a current rhinovirus infection might interfere directly with SARS-CoV-2—perhaps by kicking off interferon responses, part of the immune system that inhibits viral reproduction. A study by Ware and his colleagues, for example, shows that someone with a rhinovirus infection is 70% less likely to also get a common coronavirus infection, compared with someone who doesn’t have the sniffles. Clinical microbiologist Alberto Paniz Mondolfi at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, and colleagues have shown markedly few rhinovirus co-infections in people with SARS-CoV-2 in New York City. “Rhinovirus is one tough virus,” says Paniz Mondolfi. Its fast growth stops other viruses from taking off, and it could conceivably be outcompeting SARS-CoV-2, he says.This viral interference might be a powerful effect. Ellen Foxman, an immunologist at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, and colleagues have found evidence that rhinoviruses might have derailed the influenza H1N1 pandemic that occurred in 2009, for example. Hospitalized adults had fewer-than-expected instances of co-infection with both viruses. And, in cell cultures, rhinovirus infection stopped that strain of H1N1 from infecting cells. Foxman is now looking to see whether rhinovirus infection can block SARS-CoV-2; she expects results soon.Overall, it’s a “very likely scenario” that rhinoviruses and other coronaviruses will help to stem the spread of COVID-19, says Paniz Mondolfi. “I think many virologists, like me, have been waiting for this season to look at how this will evolve.”But with so many unknowns surrounding all these viruses, most researchers say that people should be ready for a worst-case scenario—from a bad flu season compounding the challenges of COVID-19, to future outbreaks of RSV. “It’s best to be prepared,” says Olsen. “We don’t know what’s going to happen.”This article is reproduced with permission and was first published on December 15 2020.Nicola Jones is a contributing editor and writer for Knowable Magazine and lives in Pemberton, British Columbia.

The latest to confirm cases are the capital, New Delhi, and the western state of Maharashtra, Indian media reports said on Monday. New Delhi has closed the Ghazipur wholesale poultry market, the biggest in the region, after nearly 200 birds, mostly crows, were found dead. Visitors have been barred from parks with water bodies, lakes and wildlife sanctuaries in the national capital region. Bird flu confirmed in Delhi after testing eight samples from dead crows and ducks. All the samples tested positive for avian flu: Animal Husbandry Department, Delhi — ANI (@ANI) January 11, 2021 An official in Maharashtra on Monday said at least 800 hens died there in the last two days. “Their samples were given for testing. And now it is confirmed that the reason is bird flu,” Deepak Madhukar Muglikar, a district collector of Parbhani, about 500 kilometres (310 miles) from the state capital Mumbai, told Indian broadcaster, NDTV. “It has been confirmed in Murumba village. There are about eight poultry farms and 8,000 birds. We have give orders of culling those poultry birds,” he said. On Sunday, authorities in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh shut down a zoo in Kanpur city after the death of four jungle fowls and two parrots. Test reports received late on Saturday confirmed they were positive for the virus, Kanpur district’s chief veterinary officer RP Mishra said. “We are in the process of culling all birds present in all the enclosures and the zoo has been declared a containment zone. It is unfortunate but we are following the protocol,” Mishra said. The sale of meat has been banned in a 10-km (six-mile) radius of the zoo and a close watch is being kept on all poultry farms and markets in Kanpur district. Samples from dead crows from four other Uttar Pradesh districts have been sent to a laboratory in the central Indian city of Bhopal for testing. Cases of bird flu have also been confirmed by Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and Gujarat, according to the federal government. Dead birds include poultry fowl, crows, pigeons, peacocks and migratory birds. Bird flu affects mainly poultry and wild birds but can infect humans who have close contact with sick birds. Chickens are being culled in Haryana and Madhya Pradesh. Markets and shops selling poultry have been shut for a week in seven Madhya Pradesh cities, a government spokesperson said. In the southern state of Kerala, the process of culling about 50,000 birds, mostly poultry farm ducks, has been completed in two affected districts, the state’s animal husbandry department chief KM Dileep said. Samples from Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala have tested positive for the H5N8 strain of the virus, while samples from Himachal Pradesh have shown the presence of H5N1.

Share this item with your network: By Jessica Kent Published: 12 Jan 2021 A new early warning system can fill in gaps in infectious disease surveillance and forecast the spread of influenza using predictive analytics, according to a study published in Nature Communications. Researchers noted that respiratory viruses contribute to high morbidity and mortality rates, with influenza claiming 290,000 to 650,000 lives each year alone. Surveillance and real-time forecasting systems can help prevent and control the spread of these viruses. However, the team stated that the US Influenza Surveillance System collects data from participating outpatient healthcare clinics in all US states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and the US Virgin Islands, but not in every US county. Provider participation is voluntary, and may change over time. Each week, approximately 3,000 providers report data to the CDC on the total number of patients seen for any reason, as well as the number of those patients with influenza-like illness. The research team developed a forecasting model for locations without surveillance using data streams from multiple other locations collectively in a networked system informed by human movement. The team validated the approach using historical data to demonstrate the system’s ability to forecast the spread of past outbreaks at the state and county levels. At the state level, researchers used real-world data in 35 states from the US Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch for influenza during nine seasons (2008-2009 to 2016-2017), and human metapneumovirus and seasonal coronavirus during four seasons (2013-2014 to 2016-2017). At the county level, the team validated their method using a model-generated outbreak since there are no historical data available in the majority of counties. The method they designed can create much more accurate near-term forecasts than alternative models tested by the researchers, including those that prioritize locations with large populations or use a random selection. "Our goal was to design a way to provide a cost-effective early warning system so public health officials can quickly respond to outbreaks and prevent further spread," said first author Sen Pei, PhD, associate research scientist in the Department of Environmental Health Sciences at the Columbia Mailman School. "Our method can be used to support development of a more robust surveillance system and to identify where to set up or improve surveillance." The team noted that their approach could help forecast not just influenza, but also human metapneumovirus and seasonal coronavirus, which have similar transmission routes. Researchers could also modify the system to work with other diseases. "Too often infectious outbreaks spread undetected due to gaps in surveillance at the community level. These gaps have contributed to tragic and unnecessary illness and loss of life, as we have seen over the past year," said senior author Jeffrey Shaman, PhD, a professor in the Department of Environmental Health Sciences at the Columbia Mailman School. "Our method can help fill these gaps to prevent these unwanted outcomes, and provide guidance on where to invest in greater surveillance." Researchers have previously looked to predictive analytics tools to infectious disease forecasting. In January 2019, a team from the University of Massachusetts Amherst compared the forecast accuracy of predictive analytics models to that of a historical baseline seasonal average, and found that the predictive models achieved greater accuracy than other approaches. The team noted that their findings could further advance the field of infectious disease surveillance and forecasting. “Our collaborative, team science approach highlights the ability of multiple research groups working together to uncover patterns and trends of model performance that are harder to observe in single-team studies. The field of infectious disease forecasting is in its infancy and we expect that innovation will spur improvements in forecasting in the coming years,” the team said. “Public health officials are still learning how best to integrate forecasts into real-time decision making. Close collaboration between public health policy-makers and quantitative modelers is necessary to ensure that forecasts have maximum impact and are appropriately communicated to the public and the broader public health community.” Next Steps Predictive Analytics Offers Insight into COVID-19 Spread, DisparitiesPredictive Analytics Tool Helps Fill Gaps in COVID-19 Data3 Ways Predictive Analytics is Advancing the Healthcare Industry Related Resources Top 12 Ways Artificial Intelligence Will Impact Healthcare –TechTarget Teradata LinkedIn Live: The Disruptive Economics of AI –Video Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare –Talk Dig Deeper on Artificial intelligence in healthcare FDA authorizes combined at-home flu, COVID-19 tests outside EUA By: Veronica Salib FDA approves self-administered nasal influenza vaccine By: Veronica Salib Reviewing the CDC 2024-2025 respiratory virus season outlook By: Veronica Salib WHO identifies first bird flu death in 59-year-old man By: Veronica Salib Sponsored News Flexible IT: When Performance and Security Can’t Be Compromised –Dell Technologies AI & Healthcare: Truth Behind the Buzz and a Path Forward –Greenway Health What To Know About Insurance Eligibility, Discovery, and Verification –ZOLL Data Systems See More Related Content Pfizer Eyeing Expedited FDA Approval for RSV Vaccine – Pharma Life Sciences Moderna Doses First Patient in Study of Flu mRNA ... – Pharma Life Sciences CDC unveils wastewater dashboard to track the spread ... – Pharma Life Sciences Latest TechTarget resources Health IT Healthtech Security Healthcare Payers Pharma Life Sciences xtelligent Health IT and EHR How generative AI in healthcare is helping cut admin burden Over 90% of healthcare workers feel optimistic about the promise of generative AI in healthcare to alleviate administrative ...

Over the past few weeks, cases of bird flu have been reported from various states across the South Asian nation, posing a new challenge to authorities. Officials in several states have stepped up efforts to contain two strains of bird flu — H5N1 and H5N8 — in recent days after the deaths of thousands of migratory birds, ducks, crows and chickens. Addressing the issue at a virtual meeting held with state governments, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, "Poultry farms, zoos, water bodies have to be constantly monitored to control the spread of bird flu." He stressed that authorities have put together a plan to tackle the emergency. The spread of avian influenza has been confirmed in more than ten states so far, including Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Rajasthan, Delhi and Maharashtra. States that haven't reported cases have also been asked to exercise caution. Samples from dead birds are being studied at the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), in the central city of Bhopal. "People who come in direct contact with poultry are most at risk of being infected by the flu. However, human-to-human transmission can also occur," Aravind M, a Bengaluru-based doctor, told DW.Health officials bury culled chickens at a poultry farm on the outskirt of Agartala, capital of the northeastern state of TripuraImage: Photoshot/picture alliance Spread through migratory birds Officials first detected the H5N8 strain of the virus in January after dead fowl and wild birds were found in several parts of the country. Most of the dead were Central Asian high-altitude bar-headed geese — one of the world's highest-flying birds — that migrate to South Asia during the winter season. The H5N8 subtype has spread to different parts of the world since early last year. It has also affected several countries in Europe, including France, where thousands of chicken and other poultry have been culled. India too has announced the culling of poultry and wild geese. Officials said the flu has spread in India mainly through migratory birds. The virus can spread to cats, dogs and other mammals as well. India has witnessed bouts of devastating bird flu outbreaks in recent decades, most seriously in 2008, when millions of poultry were culled. Severe economic impact The fear of the virus has hit several cities across the country, leading to plummeting prices and sales of chicken, eggs and other fowl. Poultry sales have dropped even in states that have no reported cases of the disease. While New Delhi announced a ban on the import of live birds, poultry chickens are being culled in Haryana and Madhya Pradesh and ducks in Kerala. Markets and shops selling poultry have been shut for a week in seven Madhya Pradesh cities and the Uttar Pradesh government has announced a temporary closure of the biggest wholesale poultry market in Ghazipur city. "We are the ones who are at risk, those dealing with birds on a daily basis. Now, very few people are coming to buy poultry products. This has affected our earnings. Thankfully, people are still buying lamb, so we aren't left high and dry. But if this continues for a long time, we will suffer," said Ashfaq, a meat shop owner in the national capital region. India's minister for animal husbandry, Giriraj Singh, said that it was safe to consume eggs and chicken that have been cooked up to 70 degrees Celsius (158 degrees Fahrenheit). According to the World Health Organization, the virus does not spread from person to person, and cannot survive at high temperatures. The first outbreak of bird flu was reported in India in 2006, in the western states of Gujarat and Maharashtra. Subsequently, other states too reported cases of the flu. But there were no cases of human infection. India had previously declared itself free of bird flu in September 2019.

To capture the extent of available data within these sources, we proposed a completeness metric based on the effective time series length. Using FluNet records for 29 Pan-American countries from 2005 to 2019, we explored whether completeness was associated with health expenditure indicators adjusting for surveillance system heterogeneity. We observed steady improvements in completeness by 4.2–6.3% annually, especially after the A(H1N1)-2009 pandemic, when 24 countries reached > 95% completeness. Doubling in decadal health expenditure per capita was associated with ~ 7% increase in overall completeness. The proposed metric could navigate experts in assessing open access data quality and quantity for conducting credible statistical analyses, estimating disease trends, and developing outbreak forecasting systems.

Extensive time, personnel, and monetary resources are required to collect, process, and maintain time referenced and geographically tagged surveillance data. These data enable a rapid evidence-based response to protect human health, distribute supplies, and mitigate disease outbreaks. Effective surveillance data must be credible to produce reliable alerts, complex to incorporate a variety of data streams, and historically rich to track disease trajectories for early warning detection2. Poor-quality surveillance data can lead to policy interventions that are based on inaccurately interpreted patterns resulting in diminished quality of life, less productive societies, and slower global responses3,4. High quality data available to a broad range of experts are critical to reliably predict disease trends2.The World Health Organization (WHO) has played an instrumental role in regulating the generation of international surveillance data for over 70 years. The WHO has established high standards by using a comprehensive set of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) metrics to routinely collect worldwide records5,6. These metrics track the production of surveillance data and provide critical information for effective analysis and interpretation of the data. Some of these metrics like sensitivity, specificity, and positive predicted value measure the accuracy and reliability of testing protocols and mechanisms. Other metrics, like timeliness and representativeness, provide information on the frequency and comprehensiveness of data incorporated within surveillance systems6. Together, these M&E metrics help data users understand the reliability of patterns that are captured, detected, and demonstrated based on the collected data.The WHO established the Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) in 1952 to raise awareness of the economic impact and public health consequences of influenza7,8,9. In 1997, the standardization of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology enabled rapid case identification of influenza infections and improved the ability to definitively diagnose influenza infection. These scientific breakthroughs made global virological influenza surveillance possible and led to a strengthening of the GISN through the creation of FluNet: a system of over 122 national influenza centers (NICs) and 6 international centers interconnected by Internet servers that consistently record population-level influenza in over 170 countries9,10,11,12. FluNet data is publicly available to encourage wide dissemination and analysis of influenza trends, burdens, and patterns12. This public platform supports the broader mission of WHO influenza surveillance: to monitor, plan for, and alert the world on novel influenza epidemiology for seasonal, pandemic, and zoonotic influenza12.As the velocity and volume of collected data increased from 1998–2010, so did opportunities to utilize multiple data streams and disseminate surveillance records more broadly. This gave rise to web-based platforms like FluID that actively collect, deposit, and report influenza health records using various influenza case definitions and surveillance strategies13. Information reported by these platforms includes numerous influenza-related case definitions, testing techniques, surveillance strategies, reporting timeliness, and population coverage. Once registered, any certified health center, not just a NIC, is able to participate in this data curation. The information collected by platforms like FluID complement FluNet to improve the accuracy and coverage of estimating true influenza incidence9. The merging of multiple data streams has been shown to improve rates of influenza testing and diagnosis, which greatly influence the reporting completeness of surveillance data3,4,14.National healthcare infrastructure and public health resources are likely to drive the reliability, completeness, and accuracy of reported data5. Thus, FluNet relies on the case identification and collection capacity of each participating country. While several studies examined the association between country wealth and the burden of influenza15,16,17, little is known whether country income or health expenditure indicators along with the national surveillance system attributes influence data availability. A broad network of available data streams might facilitate data collection and reporting to FluNet, but does not guarantee data completeness. Furthermore, existing WHO M&E metrics that target surveillance system quality are not embedded into metadata of publicly available records. This questions whether and how external users assess the quality and completeness of available data18,19. Yet, the completeness of publicly disseminated surveillance data influences modeled disease trends, seasonal features, outbreak signatures, and forecasts20,21,22,23.In this communication, we proposed a metric of completeness based on the effective time series length (ETSL) to capture the extent of the available time series data within FluNet records. We illustrated the utility of this metric for 29 Pan-American countries across 14 influenza variables (6 testing outcomes and 8 strain subtypes) from 2005 to 2019. We calculated this metric for each country using annual (52–53 weeks), full study (782 weeks), and select interval (470–782 weeks) time period lengths. We ranked countries based on completeness estimates and determined trends across countries. We adjusted completeness estimates for specific strain subtypes (e.g. A(H1N1)pdm09) to isolate only time periods when reporting is meaningful. We applied a mixed effects regression model to evaluate whether national economic indicators could explain the degree of completeness for each influenza variable. Our proposed completeness metric helps external data users understand the amount of data available for analyses and the potential of data to accurately estimate disease trends, detect temporal changes, and develop spot checks in data quality. This metric can also assist data users to recognize data limitations, understand the heterogeneity of primary data sources, and develop strategies for conducting credible statistical analyses using publicly disseminated surveillance data. The presented material is especially important in light of publicly reported time series data for the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.Data and methodsFluNet weekly recordsWe abstracted FluNet weekly records on 24–27 April 2020 for 29 Pan American countries from Week 1 (03 January) 2005 through Week 52 (29 December) 2019. Due to the absence of a public application programming interface (API) and the challenges of the website’s dynamic AJAX interface24, we acquired public data with a custom scraper built using RSelenium25. We downloaded each country’s records individually and used a scripted pipeline to standardize and merge country-specific datasets. Codes are available in the Supplementary Materials Appendix.FluNet reports time series data of influenza confirmed cases representing a complex array of data streams. For each country download, we extracted time series data for 6 available testing outcomes: specimens collected, specimens processed (tests), total positives, total negatives, influenza A positives, and influenza B positives. We also extracted time series data for 8 influenza subtypes: A(H1), A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3), A(H5), A(Unsubtyped), B(Yamataga), B(Victoria), and B(Undetermined). The overall data compilation included 14 variables for 29 countries covering 782 weeks.Surveillance systems attributesWe compiled FluNet case definitions, surveillance strategies, reporting quota and timeliness, NICs, and reporting facilities using several WHO reports6,26,27,28 to assess surveillance attributes associated with completeness (Table 1). Influenza case definitions are not fully standardized: they have subtle but important differences in their evaluation setting and diagnostic criteria. Case definitions for each country include severe acute respiratory illness (SARI), influenza-like-illness (ILI), pneumonia, influenza cases (Influenza), acute respiratory infection (ARI), and deaths (Mortality) (Supplementary Table S1). Mortality was defined as deaths from influenza unless otherwise specified. Six FluNet countries (Chile, Cuba, Dominica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, and Honduras) have fully adopted the WHO case definitions. We marked countries utilizing non-WHO definitions.Table 1 Case definitions, adherence to WHO case definition, surveillance strategies, reporting quotas, reporting timeframes, number of NICs, and reporting facilities for 29 Pan-American FluNet-reporting countries based on WHO and PAHO reports from 201710,11,12,13.Full size tableSurveillance strategies include national, sentinel, and universal, which offer different population coverage for each influenza case definition (Supplementary Table S2). NICs are nationally recognized institutions approved by the WHO and responsible for reporting influenza surveillance records to FluNet. Influenza reporting facilities include SARI hospitals, ILI centers, PCR testing facilities, and influenza (IF) testing laboratories, and their number vary by country. Each facility processes tests at different volumes and speeds, resulting in differing reporting quotas and timeframes. Reporting quotas describe the fraction of cases that are reported to FluNet from in-country surveillance systems. They include all cases or a specific number of cases based on each country’s health objectives. Reporting timeframe is the difference between when disease cultures are laboratory confirmed and when they are reported by surveillance facilities to a national or global database. Though FluNet publishes weekly records, reporting timeframes range from daily to monthly across countries. We found no resources that compile these surveillance system characteristics to allow for clear side-by-side comparison across continental countries.Economic and health expenditure indicatorsWe extracted three economic indicators for each country reported by the World Bank’s World Development Indicators publicly available database. Indicators included Gross National Income (GNI) per capita (GNIPC), domestic general government health expenditure per capita (DHEPC), and out-of-pocket health expenditure as a percentage of current health expenditure (OOPHE%)29. GNIPC was reported in purchasing power parity (PPP) constant 2011 international US dollars (USD). DHEPC was reported in current international USD. OOPHE% is reported as the percentage of current government expenditure (Supplementary Table S3). GNIPC estimates were available for all countries from 2005 to 2018 except Cuba and Venezuela (data available for 2005–2016 and 2005–2014, respectively). DHEPC and OOPHE% records were available from 2005 to 2016 for all countries except Venezuela (data available for 2005–2015).Completeness metricWe measured completeness based on an effective time series length (ETSL), or the extent of time series data that can be used in data analysis. Time series length greatly influenced how and what the completeness metric described. We used an annual ETSL to calculate completeness from Week 1 to Week 52/53 to compare completeness between outcomes and across countries. We used these values to calculate the overall completeness, or the mean across all years from 2005 to 2019. We also calculated the average completeness using the full time series ETSL for the entire 782-week study period. Finally, we calculated the corrected average values and corrected overall completeness by including only years when selected outcomes or subtypes were reported. This prevented the deflating of the completeness metric by including all study years irrespective of whether a country’s surveillance records were present or not.We calculated the annual completeness, Ci,j,k, as a fraction of the time series length for which reliable data are available to the overall length of the considered time series, or the number of full weeks between the start and end of the time period, multiplied by 100:$$C_{{i,j,k}} = ~\left( {{\raise0.7ex\hbox{${n_{{i,j,k}} }$} \!\mathord{\left/ {\vphantom {{n_{{i,j,k}} } {L_{1} }}}\right.\kern-\nulldelimiterspace} \!\lower0.7ex\hbox{${L_{1} }$}}} \right)*100\%$$where Ci,j,k is completeness for i-outcome (i = 1–14), j-country (j = 1–29), k-year (k = 1–15); ni,j,k—the number of time units (weeks) in the time series when records are available (e.g. weeks with reported counts ≥ 0) for i-outcome, j-country, k-year; L1—the number of full weeks (52 or 53) for k-year (Table 2). We calculated the annual completeness by using the total length in weeks for each year.Table 2 Number of full weeks included for calculating the completeness metric using annual, full study, and corrected effective time series lengths.Full size tableWe calculated the completeness for each outcome and country for the full time series using the total 782-week length covering the study period from Week 1 (03 January) 2005 to Week 52 (29 December) 2019, as:$${C}_{i,j}= \left(n_{i,j}/{L}_{i,2}\right)*100\%$$where Ci,j is completeness for i-outcome (i = 1–14), j-country (j = 1–29); ni,j—the number of time units (weeks) in the time series when records are available (e.g. weeks with reported counts ≥ 0) for i-outcome, j-country; Li,2—the number of full weeks (782) or the full study period. To draw comparisons across countries, we calculated the overall completeness as the average completeness across all 14 outcomes for each country.To more accurately reflect completeness for specific influenza outcomes, we corrected the average estimates to only include the time period when reporting is meaningful. For example, Jamaica, Paraguay, and Mexico were the first Pan American countries to report the new influenza subtype A(H1N1)pdm09 in 2008. All 29 countries have continued reporting this subtype as of 2019. Thus, we estimated the average estimates for A(H1N1)pdm09 to account for the start of pandemic strain reporting in 2008 for all countries. Specimens were also first reported in 2008 by Paraguay with Canada and the United States continuing reporting through 2019; completeness for specimens was similarly estimated for a 626-week time period from Week 1 2008 to Week 52 2019. For A(H5), we estimated average completeness from Week 1 2008 to Week 52 2016 (470 weeks). For B(Yamataga) and B(Victoria), we estimated average completeness for a 678-week time period from Week 1 2007 to Week 52 2019. All analyses of average estimates were performed using values of L3 as shown in Table 2.Completeness analysisWe examined trends in annual completeness for all 14 influenza variables and produced heatmaps illustrating the country ranking with respect to completeness. To further examine trends and associations with national economic indicators (GNIPC, DHEPC, and OOPHE%), we selected annual completeness estimates for tests, positives, A(H1N1)pdm09, and overall. We applied loess smoothers with a span of 0.5 to illustrate trends across all years and countries. We transformed the GNIPC and DHEPC values using the natural logarithm function to minimize the effect of skewed distributions in regression models. For each influenza variable, we estimated the change in annual completeness associated with time and national economic indicators using a mixed effects regression model (Model 1):$${C}_{i,j,k}= {\beta }_{0}+ {\beta }_{1}*{Year}_{k}+ {\beta }_{2}*{E}_{j,k}+ {\alpha }_{j}*{Country}_{j}+ {\varepsilon }_{jk}$$where Ci,j,k is completeness for i-outcome (i = 1–4), j-country (j = 1–29), k-year; Ej,k – one of three national indicators for j-country and k-year; β1—fixed effects for the annual trend, αj – random effects for individual countries. The length of the time series used in each regression varied according to the length of available records for the economic or health expenditure indicator in each country.We expanded the model to adjust for surveillance systems’ attributes (Model 2):$${C}_{i,j,k}= {\beta }_{0}+ {\beta }_{1}*{Year}_{k}+ {\beta }_{2}*{E}_{j,k}+{\beta }_{m}*{S}_{j,m}+ {\alpha }_{j}*{Country}_{j }+ {\varepsilon }_{jk}$$where Sj,m—matrix of the national surveillance system attributes as defined in Table 1. Attributes included in the analysis were: case definition type, including ARI, ILI, Influenza, Pneumonia, Mortality, and SARI as the reference category; adherence to WHO definition as a binary variable; surveillance strategy, including Sentinel, National, and Universal as the reference category; reporting quota, including categories for reported quota, varying or unknown quota, and reporting all cases as the reference category; reporting timeframe, as weekly, not reported (NR), and daily reporting as the reference; number of NICs, and the natural log of reporting facilities number (we applied the transformation given the skewed distribution of reporting facilities as fewer countries have many facilities).To estimate the effect size (ES) from regression model results, we calculated the decadal change between 2005 and 2015 for each economic and health expenditure indicator. For Venezuela, we estimated decadal changes in GNIPC from 2005 through 2014 due to limited data availability. Using the coefficients from Models 1 and 2, we estimated ES and its 95% confidence intervals (CI) associated with time and health expenditure indicators in the completeness of tests, positives, A(H1N1)pdm09, and overall completeness. For GNIPC and DHEPC, the effect size was associated with a doubling in these predictors; the 95% confidence interval was estimated as: \(ES=ln\left(2\right)*\left({\beta }_{2}+1.96se\left({\beta }_{2}\right)\right)\). For OOPHE%, ES was associated with a 10% increase in expenditures; 95%CI was estimated as: \(ES=10*\left({\beta }_{2}+1.96se\left({\beta }_{2}\right)\right)\).We used Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to assess model performance. Data management, statistical analyses, and maps were conducted using Stata/SE 15.1 and R versions 1.1.419 and 4.0.0.ResultsAnnual completeness, trends, and spot-checkingThe annual completeness values for each influenza outcome in each country and year of the 15-year study period are compiled in Supplementary Table S4. Figures 1 and 2 show the completeness values for influenza outcomes along with the trend line for average completeness across all 29 countries presented as a heatmap and a line-plot, respectively. In each country, completeness for tests, positives, influenza A positives, and influenza B positives are almost identical (completeness for positives shown in Fig. 1a). In 2005, these 4 outcomes are nearly 100% complete for nine countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, and the United States). Since the 2009 pandemic, 19 countries reached > 95% completeness with further improvements by 2019 when 24 countries reached > 95% completeness. This annual progression in influenza outcome surveillance illustrates the maturity of FluNet over time.Figure 1Multi-panel plots of annual completeness of (a) positives, (b) A(H1N1)pdm09, (c) A(H5), and (d) specimens for 29 Pan American countries from 2005 through 2019.

Countries are listed in descending order by corrected average completeness using three letter country abbreviations.Full size imageJamaica, Paraguay, and Mexico were the first countries with available records starting in 2008 for both influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H5) (Fig. 1b,c). For A(H1N1)pdm09, completeness across the region reached ~ 70% by 2010 and slowly grew to ~ 80% by 2019. Some countries, including Uruguay, Ecuador and Nicaragua, show a reduction in completeness for A(H1N1)pdm09 after 2014. Some countries such as Suriname, Haiti, and Barbados did not offer surveillance data for A(H1N1)pdm09 until 2015. For influenza A(H5), completeness across countries almost reached 50% in 2010, then declined to 0% by 2016 and has not been reported by any country since. A similar trajectory was seen for specimens though this testing outcome continues to be reported by the United States and Canada as of 2019 (Fig. 1d).The completeness of influenza A(H1) for the region grew from 43 to 70% between 2009 and 2011 and decreased gradually from 75% in 2014 to 56% as of 2019 (Fig. 2a). The completeness of influenza A(Unsubtyped) increased briefly in 2008 just prior to the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic. In 2009, the average completeness across countries increased from 46 to 75% completeness by 2011; it began to decline in 2014, surging back to ~ 70% completeness in 2017 but gradually declining again to 68% completeness as of 2019 (Fig. 2b).Influenza B(Yamataga) and B(Victoria) subtypes have showed increased trends in completeness since 2012 (Fig. 2c,d). Both subtypes increased in completeness from 2007 to 2010 however the average completeness across countries did not exceed 50% for either subtype. After a brief decline from 2010 to 2011, the average completeness grew for both subtypes from 32% in 2012 to 75% in 2014. While declining from 2014 to 2016, completeness for these influenza B subtypes continuously increased thereafter and reached an average of ~ 67% across the region as of 2019.In addition to temporal trends, we detected anomalies in annual completeness for influenza subtypes. For example, Fig. 1a showed that the United States, despite having 100% completeness in all other years, had only 63.5% completeness in 2006. During this year, we found that records for total positives are missing from Week 21 (22 May) to Week 49 (10 December). Yet, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported influenza records during these missing weeks30. Though cases are near zero, the national surveillance system does collect data on influenza positives that were not reported in FluNet.Missing reports for influenza positives in 2018 from Week 30 (23 July) to Week 38 (23 September) in Peru provided another example of using annual completeness for spot-checking data quality (Fig. 1a). Reports from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) suggest that Peru reported a surge in influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and SARI activity during these weeks31,32,33. Despite increased case counts, influenza activity dipped below the alert threshold with pneumonia cases increasing for infants < 5 years of age. Like in the United States, PAHO reported case information on influenza A positives, influenza B positives, and subtypes including A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(Unsubtyped) during these weeks33 though no data is reported within FluNet.We also used annual completeness to identify patterns across variables and study years for specific countries. For example, while a surveillance system existed in Venezuela beginning in 2005, annual completeness varied greatly from 2005 to 2019 (Supplementary Table S5). Though surveillance data was reported for 2005–2007, completeness dropped to 0% for all influenza variables for 2008–2010 during the known rise of the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic. While 100% completeness was achieved for nearly all influenza outcomes and subtypes in 2011, completeness again dropped to 0% in 2012 and 2013. Since 2014, however, Venezuela maintained > 75% completeness for 5 of 6 influenza outcomes and 7 of 8 influenza subtypes. This fluctuation in annual completeness suggested that attributes related to the surveillance system or factors influencing surveillance performance such as economic stability and health expenditure could be influencing completeness.Overall completeness ranking and economic and health expenditure indicatorsThe overall and average completeness values for six influenza outcomes for each country are compiled in Table 3 (all outcomes are reported in Supplementary Table S6). A map of average overall completeness is shown in Fig. 3. The overall completeness was > 80% for 4 countries (Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, United States) and > 70% for an additional 6 countries (Chile, Peru, El Salvador, Paraguay, Honduras, Panama). Completeness for tests, positives, influenza A positives, and influenza B positives were nearly identical for all countries except Brazil, Peru, Honduras, Jamaica, Costa Rica, Venezuela, and Ecuador where test completeness was slightly less than positives completeness. Eight countries (Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, United States, Chile, Peru, Colombia, and the Dominican Republic) had > 90% completeness for tests and total, influenza A, and influenza B positives. The average completeness values for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H5) across all countries were 66% and 25%, respectively. Seven countries (Suriname, Haiti, Belize, Barbados, St. Lucia, Dominica, and St. Vincent & Grenadines) had < 40% completeness for all influenza outcomes, subtypes, and overall completeness. Figure 4 demonstrates that high and low overall completeness was likely in countries of mid-range DHEPC and OOPHE%. Given the similarity in completeness for multiple outcomes, we selected tests, positives, A(H1N1)pdm09, and overall completeness for further regression analyses.Table 3 The overall and average completeness of seven influenza variables and three economic and health expenditure indicators for 2005–2019 time period for 29 Pan American countries and all countries combined.Full size tableFigure 3A map of average overall completeness for 29 Pan American countries over the 782-week time series starting from Week 1 (03 January) 2005 to Week 52 (29 December) 2019.

The decadal change of economic indicators for each country and averaged across countries (with standard deviation estimates) is provided in Supplementary Table S7. GNIPC and DHEPC almost doubled (2.02 ± 0.67 vs 2.19 ± 0.77, respectively) between 2005 and 2015; and OOPHE% declined by 16 ± 18%.Figure 5Annual trends presented as loess-smoothed curves along with their confidence intervals in country-specific completeness for four influenza outcome variables (overall, tests, positives, and A(H1N1)pdm09 completeness) for 29 Pan American countries over the 782-week time series starting from Week 1 (03 January) 2005 to Week 52 (29 December) 2019. Horizontal dashed red lines indicate 50% completeness.Full size imageFigure 6Annual trends presented as loess-smoothed curves along with their confidence intervals for three national economic and health expenditure indicators for 29 Pan American countries for available years between 2005 and 2018.

DHEPC was reported in current international USD. OOPHE% is reported as the percentage of current government expenditure.Full size imageTable 4 shows the annual change in completeness for four outcome variables estimated from unadjusted (Model 1) and adjusted (Model 2) mixed effects models. All variables exhibited a strong positive trend with an annual increase in completeness from 4.2 to 6.3% on average. Improvements in completeness were most prominent for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 showing a strong positive relationship with GNIPC. DHEPC was the strongest predictor of completeness across all influenza outcome variables. With the doubling in DHEPC achieved on average in the region, all four variables exhibited an improvement in completeness up to 9.4%. A projected 10% change in OOPHE% had no association with changes in completeness.Table 4 Estimated annual change in completeness of four influenza outcome variables and three economic and health expenditure indicators in 29 Pan American countries over the 782-week time series starting from Week 1 (03 January) 2005 to Week 52 (29 December) 2019.Full size tableThe adjusted models also indicated that the high numbers of NICS and reporting facilities were consistently associated with an increase in completeness. For every additional NIC, the completeness for tests, positives, and overall completeness increased by ~ 18–24% irrespective of the economic or expenditure indicator assessed. Similarly, every additional NIC was associated with a 15–20% increase in influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 completeness. A doubling in the number of in-country reporting facilities was associated with a 1.85–5.00% increase in completeness across all influenza outcomes and economic indicators. While some countries use multiple surveillance systems or followed numerous reporting quotas, timeframes, and case definitions, on average there was no difference in completeness values across surveillance system attributes.DiscussionIn this study, we demonstrated the progress made by FluNet over the last decade towards achieving high overall completeness in publicly available influenza surveillance records. The proposed metric shows that influenza surveillance reporting has improved especially after the A(H1N1) 2009 pandemic, highlighting the effort by national systems and the WHO. This metric further demonstrated the substantial increase in completeness after the 2013 WHO guidelines for influenza surveillance5. These improvements were practically identical for tests, total positives, influenza A positives, and influenza B positives indicating the systematic approach taken in their reporting. As of 2019, 24 of 29 Pan-American countries were operating at > 95% of completeness for these key outcomes, though efforts are still needed to ensure consistent surveillance for other indicators. National reporting infrastructures continued to increase in their richness and heterogeneity, which indicates wider in-country surveillance coverage14. Annual completeness estimates continue to improve over time by ~ 5% annually and the rates of improvement are similar among countries with different national surveillance systems attributes. Yet, countries with higher numbers of NICs, more reporting facilities, and greater health expenditures showed the best performance. The proposed completeness metric provides essential information on data availability and suitability for statistical analysis and modeling and can improve the utility of existing data for all users.Our metric is based on the effective time series length and can be computed for any pre-specified time periods. The metric ultimately reflects the fraction of weeks when surveillance reports are missing. We define ‘missing’ as a week for which case counts are undefined or not reported. This is not to be mistaken with zero reported observations, or the absence of counts for a specific case definition. To further the utility of the completeness metric, we recommend supplementing publicly disseminated reports with metadata on why data are missing, what missing data means, and how much missing data are reported.Although the metric is simple to implement and interpret, the metric could not take into consideration patterns of missingness. Missing records could be distributed randomly or systematically throughout the study period when the data displays structural missingness with records lost in chunks or more frequently during specific times of the year. However, low completeness estimates call for attention to further investigate the pattern of missingness. This was demonstrated above in examples with the United States, Peru, and Venezuela where we identified periods of missing weeks and years using our metric. By knowing the temporal distribution of missing records some correction can be made during the analysis stage, for example by using completeness as an additional variable to reduce the weight of years with incomplete records. Closer inspection into patterns of missingness can also be used for verifying, inspecting, or updating public records within a data source prior to analysis.The metric provides greater clarity on how a country’s surveillance system quality changes over time and helps identify anomalies in surveillance reporting. If an unusual drop in completeness is noted yet the national surveillance records exist for the time period in question, such discrepancies can be curated in a timely manner. Furthermore, such discrepancy calls into question whether external data users could help data curating organizations with checking the fidelity and accuracy of the data they use and their assumptions for handling missing data.By examining annual completeness estimates, users could determine the study interval with reliable information. In the extracted records from 2005 to 2019, each country-outcome-specific time series had varying numbers and patterns of weeks with missing information. While a longer historical reference period indicates greater statistical power in estimating disease trends, some outcomes are collected over limited time frames. The length of these time series is influenced by the country of interest, outcome of interest, and date of data extraction. For example, positives of A(H1N1)pdm09 showed consistently high completeness across most countries from 2009 to 2019. Yet, for some countries, records were available for a fraction of that period. Based on our findings, we encourage data users to clearly specify the start and end date of their time series, the completeness of that time series, and the date of data extraction.In recent years, the WHO has taken numerous efforts to evaluate the economic burden associated with seasonal influenza, especially in lower- and middle-income countries34,35,36. These efforts, including a published Manual for estimating the economic burden of seasonal influenza in 2016, aim to demonstrate the value of population surveillance by calculating the direct medical, direct non-medical, and indirect costs of influenza illness34,35. Studies applying methodologies outlined in this manual confirm that increased country income and health expenditure is associated with increased immunization policies, vaccination coverage, health infrastructure, and surveillance coverage35,36. The WHO 2016 manual further recognizes that data validity and completeness can influence assessments of economic burdens related to national income, domestic health expenditure, and out-of-pocket health expenditure34.Our study faced several challenges related to data availability and accessibility. First, the FluNet data portal requires country time series to be downloaded individually and merged using a scripted pipeline. This process is both inefficient and prone to human error during data alignment and compilation. While our data extraction and merging code overcomes this challenge, we encourage FluNet curators to allow for multi-country data downloads and improve data accessibility.Next, we examined only the most recent records starting in 2005. Our initial intention was to use all available data from 1995 to 2019. We completed two attempts to extract records: first on 15 December 2019 and second on 26 April 2020 to retrieve data for the final weeks of 2019. Between extraction dates, however, available FluNet data changed dramatically: data originally available from Week 1 1995 to Week 52 2004 were reported as missing at the time of second extraction. No justification is provided regarding this change. Thus, we encourage FluNet curators to provide information on when, by how much, and why retrospective records are modified to ensure accuracy and validity of analyses performed with the open source records.Finally, we recognize that examined national economic indicators, such as DHEPC and OOPHE% describe all national health expenditures and the fraction of health expenditures dedicated to influenza may vary dramatically each year. During the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic, health expenditures may have been quite high for influenza vaccinations and testing. Moving forward, the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have decreased this fraction of health expenditures for influenza monitoring much lower. A better tracking of influenza-related expenditures at the national and global levels is needed to confirm or refute our findings.In prior works, we have developed tools and explored the seasonality of influenza and other infections. In a study of pandemic seasonal epidemics in Wisconsin from 1967 to 2004, we found that seasonal peak timing varied greatly and while viral evolution played an important role, the variability of seasonality estimates was also influenced by the data granularity23. The estimates (and their confidence intervals) of seasonal peak timing and intensity could be in part influenced by data aggregation and completeness of surveillance data and thus affect our understanding of deviations in influenza seasonality21. Our mini-review of mathematical modeling techniques for influenza transmission highlighted that variations in theories governing seasonal dynamics could also be attributed to data availability limitations22.Examining disease trends and seasonal epidemic signatures allows for greater understanding of influenza transmission and developing preparedness strategies at the local, national, and regional levels2,18,19,20,36. The proposed metric of completeness is essential in estimating the statistical power to detect disease trends and temporal changes by providing the effective length of disease surveillance time series data. Further work is needed to understand how completeness influences the reliability of modeling results. The use of the proposed metric will also allow for better assessment of the quality of historical data for tracking disease trends. The continuously updated surveillance records and the ensemble of disease outcomes allows for adaptive modeling to create real-time forecasts and detection of local events with high spatiotemporal granularity2.ConclusionThis study provided the first attempt at quantifying the percentage of available data usable for closer examination of disease trends or seasonality analyses. As more surveillance data becomes available for public use, indicators such as completeness should be applied to ensure quality, accuracy, and reliability of trend estimations. The proposed metric of completeness is vital to any secondary time series data analysis where the data user did not curate the data source. This metric can also be estimated and reported by external data users to ensure reliability and improve understanding of data structure. This next step in data sharing can help external data users detect outbreak signatures more accurately and reliably as well as improve health policies, programming, and recommendations. Combined with access to already developed WHO M&E indicators, the completeness metric for publicly disseminated data will strengthen disease surveillance systems.

Though the currently available filters are effective at removing submicron-sized particulates, filter materials with enhanced virus-capture efficiency are still in demand. Coating or chemically modifying filters with molecules capable of binding influenza viruses has received attention as a promising approach for the production of virus-capturing filters. For this purpose, tannic acid (TA), a plant-derived polyphenol, is a promising molecule for filter functionalization because of its antiviral activities and ability to serve as a cost-efficient adhesive for various materials. This study demonstrates the facile preparation of TA-functionalized high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter materials and their efficiency in influenza virus capture. Polypropylene HEPA filter fabrics were coated with TA via a dipping/washing process. The TA-functionalized HEPA filter (TA-HF) exhibits a high in-solution virus capture efficiency of up to 2,723 pfu/mm2 within 10 min, which is almost two orders of magnitude higher than that of non-functionalized filters. This result suggests that the TA-HF is a potent anti-influenza filter that can be used in protective equipment to prevent the spread of pathogenic viruses.

Every year, 1 billion cases are reported, of which 3‒5 million are severe cases, with 290,000‒650,000 influenza-related respiratory deaths worldwide1. Aerosol transmission is the predominant mode of influenza virus transmission in households, accounting for approximately half of all transmission events2. Thus, preventive measures to deal with influenza virus particles present in the air are urgently needed. To eliminate airborne viruses, filters have been developed for face masks, air purifiers, and ventilation systems. High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters in particular are gaining popularity as they block the passage of approximately 99.97% of particles with a diameter > 0.3 μm3. However, viral particles with a small diameter (e.g., influenza virus; ~ 100 nm) may still pass through the filter3. Therefore, filters with enhanced virus capture capability based on affinity binding, which would efficiently limit the spread of viral infection, are in high demand. Several types of antiviral and virus-adsorbing materials have been incorporated in or coated on filters, including sialyllactose4, curdlan sulfate5, poly(ethylenimine)6, and sodium chloride7. Although previous reports have shown promising results for viral capture or inactivation, they have limitations such as high cost4,5, narrow-spectrum targets4, multi-step production4,5, possible toxicity6, or insufficient stability7. Particularly during pandemics, it is crucial to supply cheap and easily made respirators (e.g., filters and masks) rather than expensive and complex ones, so that even countries with economical constraint do not suffer from severe shortages of equipment. Thus, it is important to develop cost-effective and environmentally friendly coating materials that can serve as broad-spectrum virus capturing agents on filter surfaces with high efficiency and stability. Tannic acid (TA), a high molecular weight polyphenol, is widely known for its antioxidant and antibacterial activities8 and protein-aggregating properties9,10. TA has a unique structure with multiple catechol and galloyl groups linked to a glucose core. This structure allows it to form multiple modes of interaction, such as hydrogen bonding, metal chelation, and electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, with a variety of materials of different chemical compositions and surface properties11,12,13,14,15,16. In addition, owing to the recent outbreak of novel respiratory disease viruses, the antiviral activity of polyphenols against a wide range of virus strains such as herpes virus17, Zika virus18, coronavirus19,20, and influenza virus21,22 have been highlighted. In particular, TA has been spray-coated on filter materials to inactivate influenza viruses, as described in a previously published patent23. However, several important issues involved in the development of TA-treated filter materials have not been thoroughly addressed, such as the virus capture property, storage stability, and mechanistic basis of virus infection inhibition.In this study, we demonstrate a simple, cost-effective, and robust strategy for anti-influenza filter development by introducing the natural antiviral compound TA onto the surface of polypropylene (PP) HEPA filter fabric, combining the material-independent coating and virus-capturing properties of TA (Fig. 1). We also demonstrate a possible mechanism for TA-functionalized filter materials to capture influenza viruses and their potential for practical use based on results from inhibition assays, cytotoxicity assays, assessing storage stabilities at different temperatures, and monitoring capturing capability in typical environments where these filters would be used.Figure 1Preparation of TA-HF for influenza virus capture. Schematic illustration of TA-HF preparation and influenza virus capture based on interaction of TA with viral proteins (HA hemagglutinin, NA neuraminidase, M2 matrix-2). TA tannic acid, HF high-efficiency particulate air filter.Full size imageResults and discussionPreparation and characterization of TA-functionalized HEPA filter materialsTo prepare TA-functionalized HEPA filter fabric (TA-HF), the filter was treated with TA solution (1, 5, 10, and 20 mg/mL, pH 5) (Fig. 1). TA functionalization was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The only peak observed for the bare HF XPS spectrum was C 1s, as the PP hydrocarbon surface contained no heteroatoms (Fig. 2a, bottom). However, an O 1s peak appeared after TA functionalization (Fig. 2a, top), indicating that TA was successfully introduced to the PP surface. We confirmed that the peak area ratio O 1s/C 1s of the filter materials increased from 0.09 to 0.12 as the TA concentration increased from 1 to 5 mg/mL (Fig. S1). Moreover, in the TA concentration range of 5–20 mg/mL, O 1s/C 1s remained relatively constant at 0.12–0.13 (Fig. S1). Therefore, a TA concentration of 5 mg/mL was employed in further experiments. Even after TA functionalization, no significant change was observed in the porous fibrous structures and surface morphology of the HF (Fig. 2b,c). Meanwhile, the HF surface became less hydrophobic after TA functionalization, which was confirmed by water contact angle measurements (Fig. 2d). The TA-HF surface showed a decreased contact angle of 94 ± 3.5° compared to a contact angle of 125 ± 5° for the bare HF surface, again confirming that hydrophilic TA is present on the HF surface. The phenolic functionality of TA on TA-HF was examined by assessing nanoparticle growth in the presence of silver ions, taking advantage of the reducing properties of TA. The growth of nanoparticles was observed on TA-HF after immersion in AgNO3 solution (100 mM) for 12 h, but no nanoparticles were observed on the bare HF (Fig. 2e,f). These nanoparticles were identified as silver-based on energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (Fig. S2).Figure 2Surface characterization of TA-HF.

TA tannic acid, HF high-efficiency particulate air filter, SEM scanning electron microscopy.Full size imageTA-hemagglutinin interactionWe examined whether TA molecules exhibit binding to hemagglutinin (HA), the most abundant protein on the surface of influenza viruses. The HA-TA interaction was observed by SDS-PAGE, where the HA band at approximately 70 kDa shifted to a higher molecular weight, and its intensity became weaker as the concentration of TA increased from 4.9 to 19.6 mM (Fig. 3a and Fig. S2). The shift and intensity decrease of the band were accompanied by TA-HA aggregate formation, which remained in the well of the gel (Fig. S3). This result indicates that the TA-HF material may mediate adsorption of IAV onto the filter surface via TA-HA interaction.Figure 3Influenza virus capture efficiency of TA-HF.

TA tannic acid, HF high-efficiency particulate air filter, SEM scanning electron microscopy, IAV influenza A virus.Full size imageEfficiency of the TA-HF in influenza virus captureIndeed, we observed that TA-HF efficiently captured IAVs such as A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 (PR8) and A/Aichi/2/68 H3N2 (X31) from suspension within 10–120 min, while the bare HF removed only 11% and 5% of X31 and PR8, respectively, even after 120 min (Fig. 3b,c). Each filter sample was prepared as a circular disk with a diameter of 6 mm and placed in a viral suspension [230 μL, 12,236‒83,720 plaque-forming units (pfu)] for 10 or 120 min with gentle shaking, followed by a neuraminidase activity assay of the remaining suspension to determine the viral concentration based on the standard curve (Fig. S4). TA-HF captured most of the viral particles within 10 min [PR8, 83% (345 pfu/mm2); X31, 93% (2723 pfu/mm2)], indicating that IAV capture by TA-HF occurs rapidly. Following this, we investigated the IAV concentration-dependent capture efficiency of TA-HF. Capture efficiencies of > 80% and > 90% were observed for PR8 and X31, respectively, in the high viral concentration range of 4 × 104 pfu/mL to 4 × 105 pfu/mL (Fig. 3d). These results revealed that the full capacity of TA-HF to capture virus was 14,187 pfu/mm2 for X31 and 1,968 pfu/mm2 for PR8 (Fig. S5). The remarkable IAV capturing capability of TA-HF was also confirmed by the reduction in plaque formation of the viral suspensions that had been in contact with TA-HF (Fig. 3e and Fig. S6). The bare HF reduced the plaque number by only 8.9‒28.5%, whereas TA-HF successfully eliminated all plaques (similar to the cell-only control). IAV capture was clearly observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. 3f and Fig. S7 (right)); spherical virus particles (100‒120 nm in diameter) were observed on the TA-HF filter, whereas the bare HF did not show viral adsorption (Fig. 3g and Fig. S7 (left)). We believe that the virus-capturing efficiency of TA-HF shown in these in-solution tests can be translated to that of TA-HF for aerosols or droplets containing respiratory fluid and viral particles in the following aspect. Viral aerosols are tiny particles of liquid that contain viruses floating in the air. Therefore, upon contact of viral aerosols with filters, interaction between the virus and filter surface occurs at the interface between the filter surface and the moist liquid.Cytotoxicity and storage stability of TA-HFFor practical use of the developed filter materials, it is important to investigate their biosafety and storage stability properties. A cell viability assay performed using a Transwell system showed that TA-HF exhibited no cytotoxicity toward Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells over a period of 3 days (Fig. 4a). Next, a TA-HF sample used for X31-capture was immediately tested for cytotoxicity in the same manner, to examine whether the captured viruses can exert a negative effect on cell growth (Fig. 4b and Fig. S8). The captured viruses exhibited no detectable cytotoxicity, indicating that they remained firmly attached to the filter surface and were not released into the culture medium. The storage stability of TA-HF was evaluated by measuring the virus capture efficiency of filters after storage at − 20 °C, 4 °C, or 25 °C for one or two months. Temperature had no impact on the stability of the filters over the storage period (Fig. 4c,d), and the virus capture efficiencies of the TA-HFs remained in the range of 87‒99% after two months of storage.Figure 4Investigation of the biosafety and storage stability of TA-HF.

(c,d) Influenza virus capture efficiency of TA-HFs, which were freshly prepared and stored for one or two months at − 20 °C, 4 °C, or 25 °C, to determine the storage stability of TA-HF.

(e) Influenza virus capture efficiency of TA-HFs for a period of three weeks placed in indoor environment (ID) and inside an air purifier environment (AP). TA tannic acid, HF high-efficiency particulate air filter.Full size imageEvaluation of filter lifetime in a typical environmentWe designed experiments to monitor changes in the lifetime of the filters placed in a virtual regular environment where the filters would possibly be used. Two locations, indoor (ID) group and an air purifier (AP) group, were chosen. The ID group was a typical indoor office environment where several people spent a majority of their time per day. In the AP group, a filter was placed inside an air purifier between a pre-filter and HEPA filter, both of which were in the purifier. The air purifier was placed in the aforementioned indoor office and set to operate for a period of 21 days. The TA-HF filter in each group was removed at designated time points (0, 7, 14, and 21 days) and immediately assayed for in-solution virus capture. The TA-HFs in both ID and AP groups retained their virus-capturing efficiency up to 85% (ID) and 81% (AP) for 21 days (Fig. 4e). These results indicate that the TA-functionalized filters have immense potential for practical use in influenza virus prevention equipment and devices.ConclusionsThe simple and environmentally friendly process of TA-HF preparation was demonstrated, and the TA-HF showed remarkable efficiency for IAV capture based on the strong interaction between TA and IAV. Rapid and efficient virus capture was achieved by TA-HF, best exemplified by the capture performance of 2730 pfu/mm2 for the X31 virus in a span of 10 min. TA-HF displayed no cytotoxicity and was stable enough to retain over 87% of the initial virus capture capability during a two-month storage, which holds great promise for practical use in influenza virus infection-preventive filters. The use of versatile TA as a filter coating material allows not just the development of highly affordable and easy-to-produce anti-influenza filters, but also demonstrates that TA-functionalized filters may be expanded to prevent the spread of broad-spectrum pathogenic viruses.MethodsMaterialsPP HEPA filter fabrics (H14) were gifts from Envioneer Co., Ltd (Sungnam, Korea). All reagents were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification. Acetic acid, sodium acetate, silver nitrate (AgNO3), phosphate buffered saline (PBS), tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TCK)-treated trypsin, minimum essential medium (MEM), and antibiotic/antimycotic solution (Pen/Strep/Fungiezone) were purchased from Hyclone (Pittsburgh, USA). TA, 36.5% formaldehyde, and crystal violet were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (USA). Polypropylene (PP) nominal prefilter (0.2 μm) was purchased from Sterlitech (Korea). Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells (MDCK, NBL-2) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (USA). Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) was purchased from Thermo Fisher (Waltham, MA, USA), and 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-α-D-neuraminic acid (MUNANA) was purchased from GoldBio (St Louis, MO, USA). Sea plaque agarose was purchased from Lonza (Alpharetta, GA, USA). Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) was purchased from Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc. (Japan). Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was obtained from Atlas Biologicals (Fort Collins, CO, USA).Preparation of TA-HFTA (0.1 g) was dissolved in 20 mL of pH 5.0 acetate buffer. The fabric of the HEPA filter was cut into a rectangle of 2 cm × 4 cm and immersed in the TA solution. The TA coating proceeded for 16 h at 22 °C in the dark with gentle shaking. After the functionalization process, the filter fabric was transferred to fresh deionized water and washed three times (15 mL each). The excess water was removed using filter paper and gaseous nitrogen and dried in air for 12 h. For XPS, a PP nominal prefilter (0.2 μm) was used because the fabric of the HEPA filter was not appropriate for XPS due to its loosely woven texture. All coating, washing, and drying steps of the PP nominal prefilter were performed in the same manner as described above.Characterization of TA-HFThe surface morphology and chemical composition of the prepared TA-HF were analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and XPS. The TA coating was also confirmed by silver nanoparticle growth on the filter, which took advantage of the reducing property of TA. The filter samples were analyzed by FE-SEM (JSM7000F, JEOL, Japan) after coating with iridium to a thickness of 3 nm. The accelerating voltage was 5 kV. The typical magnification was × 50,000‒100,000. Elemental mapping was conducted with SEM (JSM7000F, JEOL, Japan) to observe silver nanoparticle formation on TA-HF samples. XPS analysis of the filter fabrics was performed using a Model ESCALAB250 (Thermo Scientific, USA) instrument with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source. For each sample, a survey scan from 0 to 1100 eV binding energy (BE) and elemental scans of O 1s and C 1s were acquired to determine the composition. Measurements were performed on three independent replicates for each sample. The growth of silver nanoparticles on the filter samples was initiated by immersing the TA-HF in aqueous AgNO3 (100 mM) and incubating it in the dark at 22 °C for 12 h. The resulting filters were washed with deionized water three times and dried using gaseous nitrogen prior to SEM analysis. The contact angle was measured by angle analysis in ImageJ (http:/sb.info.nih.gov/ij/) using an image captured with a digital microscope (AM7013MZT, Dino-Lite, USA). For each drop, clean deionized water was used, and the drop volume was 10 μL. The final measurement was an average of 3 replicates for each drop.Viral harvest and purificationFertile eggs were incubated in a brooder at 37 °C and 45% humidity for 10 days. Then, the A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 (PR8) or A/Aichi/2/68 H3N2 (X31) strain of the influenza virus was inoculated into the eggs at 10,000 pfu/mL (100 μL for each egg). The development of the eggs was aborted 3 days post-infection by moving to a refrigerator at 4 °C. The next day, the allantoic fluid was collected from each egg and centrifuged at 1792 × g for 30 min to remove excess debris. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 μm pore size filter and centrifuged at 36,042 g for 1.5 h. Each pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of PBS (pH 7.4) overnight. The following day, the viral suspensions were purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation (50%, 40%, 30%, and 20%, sequentially from bottom to top) at 58,804 × g for 2.5 h. The band that appeared between the 40% and 30% layers was collected. After additional centrifugation at 58,804×g for 1.5 h, the virus pellet was resuspended in PBS at an appropriate titer. The final virus stock was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 °C in a deep freezer.IAV tittering based on neuraminidase activity assayThe viral suspension (200 μL) was placed in a well of a black 96-well plate. Then, 50 μL of MUNANA (0.5 mM in PBS) was added to each well. Following incubation of the mixture at 37 °C for 2 h, the resulting fluorescence of the mixture was measured (λex: 355 nm; λem: 460 nm). The fluorescence values were converted to PFU based on the standard curve for each viral strain (Fig. S3).Plaque formation reduction assayMDCK cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well in a 12-well plate. When cells reached 90‒100% confluency, the cells were washed with PBS and inoculated with PR8 or X31 for 1 h. The cells were then rinsed with PBS and overlaid with low-melting-temperature agar. After 3‒4 days, the cells were fixed with 1 mL of 0.38% formaldehyde for 3 h. Then, the agar overlay was carefully removed with running water and stained with 0.5% crystal violet for 30 min. For in-solution virus-capture assay, viral suspension (PR8: 2.56 × 106 pfu/mL; X31: 3.36 × 106 pfu/mL) that had been in contact with TA-HF or bare HF for 1 h was diluted 5 × 104 times, and 0.5 mL of the resulting viral suspension was used as inoculum. The number of plaque forming units (pfu)/mL was calculated according to the following equation: number of plaques/[dilution factor × (mL of inoculum/plate)].In-solution virus-capture assayPR8 and X31 suspensions were diluted with PBS to a designated concentration. Then, the in-solution virus capture assay was performed in a 96-well round plate (230 μL in each well). Each filter sample was prepared as a circular disk with a diameter of 6 mm using a biopsy punch and placed in the viral suspension for 10 or 120 min with gentle shaking. Then, the filter samples were washed three times with PBS, and the titer of the remaining influenza virus suspension was evaluated based on MUNANA or plaque assay. ReferencesOrganization, W. H.

Here we show that hemagglutinin cleavage sites (HACS) of H9N2 viruses tended to mutate towards hydrophilic via evolutionary transition, and the tribasic HACS were found at high prevalence in Asia and the Middle East. Our finding suggested that the tribasic H9N2 viruses increased the viral replication, stability, pathogenicity and transmission in chickens and the virulence of mice compared to the monobasic H9N2 viruses. Notably, the enlarged stem-loop structures of HACS in the RNA region were found in the increasing tribasic H9N2 viruses. The enlarged HACS RNA secondary structures of H9N2 viruses did not influence the viral replication but accelerated the frequency of nucleotide insertion in HACS. With the prevailing tendency of the tribasic H9N2 viruses, the tribasic HACS in H9N2 viruses should be paid more attention.

The Eurasian lineage formed three distinct sublineages represented by their prototype strains: A/quail/HongKong/G1/97 (G1-like), A/duck/HongKong/Y280/97 (Y280-like), and A/chicken/HongKong/Y439/97 (Y439-like)1,2,3,4. Although frequently updated commercial vaccines were used in areas of endemicity, the influenza A (H9N2) viruses continued to persist in avian and wild birds. The broad prevalence of the influenza A (H9N2) virus in birds naturally increased the risk of transmission to mammals, including dogs, pigs, and humans5,6,7,8. From 2013 to 2018, 27 human cases were laboratory-confirmed in China, Egypt, and Bangladesh as influenza A(H9N2) viruses, while only 13 cases were reported prior to 20125,7,9,10,11,12, suggesting an increasing threat to human health. Strikingly, influenza A(H9N2) virus had continuously contributed to some zoonotic spillover events via the reassortment of cross-species variants, including the H5N1 influenza virus in HongKong in 1997, the H7N9 and H10N8 influenza viruses in 2013, and the H5N6 influenza virus in 201513,14,15,16,17, posing public health concerns.An essential step in infection by influenza A viruses is the proteolytic processing of the trimeric hemagglutinin cleavage site (HACS)18. For infection to occur, the HA0 precursor must be cleaved into the HA1 and HA2 subunits, thereby revealing a fusion peptide for membrane fusion19. Although the infection of H9N2 viruses is usually mild and localized to the respiratory and intestinal tracts due to the restriction of the proteases, the cleavage sites of distinct H9N2 lineages present are with the continuing evolution7,20,21,22. H9N2 viruses varied remarkably in the amino acid at the HACS. The nomenclature of the monobasic, dibasic, and tribasic influenza viruses was designated previously, with basic amino acids occurring once, twice, and three times, respectively. Viruses with the tribasic PAKSKR/G-motif and dibasic PARSSR/G-motif, PAKSSR, and PSRSSR/G-motif viruses in the Y280-sublineages and G1-sublineages had been found at high prevalence in Asia and the Middle East in birds and humans. The monobasic H9N2 viruses bearing one basic amino acid residue at the P1 position were frequently found in the Y439-sublineage and North America-lineage in wild birds; however, there had been no human infections. Thus, the main question is which HACS motifs in distinct lineages confer a replicative advantage to the virus in chickens and mammals and pose an increasing threat to humans.The H5 and H7 subtype influenza viruses can evolve from low pathogenic (LP) to highly pathogenic (HP) in natural reservoirs, in which virulence can be increased in birds and can then posed threats to humans14,23,24. A previous study suggested that the enlarged stem-loop structures of HACS accelerated the multiple adenine and/or guanine insertions required to create codons for basic amino acids24. Although the H9N2 viruses were LP and did not possess a polybasic cleavage sites, some carry a motif similar to the cleavage sites were found in the HP H5N1 and H7N3 viruses25,26,27, indicative of the potential to acquire a polybasic site. In this study, we analyzed the genetic evolution and the structures of HACS among distinct H9N2 lineages, and introduced a scatter plot tool to show the selection and avoidance of certain predominant HACS mutations. Then, we evaluated the viral replication, stability, cleavage efficiency, and virulence in chickens and mice of H9N2 viruses bearing different cleavage site motifs. In addition, the correlation between the frequency of the nucleotide insertion and the size and locations of the stem-loop structures of different HACS among H9N2 viruses was assessed.ResultsBioinformatic analysis of the cleavage sites of global influenza A (H9N2) virusesTo better understand the evolution, prevalence, and molecular features of the cleavage sites of the global influenza A (H9N2) viruses, hemagglutinin (HA) sequences were studied from a genetic perspective by performing multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis. With the flexibility of the P2, P4, and P5 positions in the HACS, the cleavage sites showed variability in different clades as depicted by WebLogo (Fig. 1a, d, e). The amino acid sequences of the cleavage sites of the HA1/HA2 junction possessed 5 main cleavage motifs, including PARSSR/G-motif, PSRSSR/G-motif, PAKSSR/G-motif, PAKSKR/G-motif, and PAASDR/G-motif (Fig. 2). We found that a steep increase in the number of PSRSSR/G-motifs occurred in China after 2006 (Fig. 1b,d and Fig. 2). Soon afterwards, the PSRSSR/G-motif had replaced the PARSSR/G-motif as a dominant cleavage motif of Y280-like H9N2 viruses in chickens and humans. The PARSSR/G and PAKSSR/G-motifs were widely prevalent in some countries, mainly including China, Iran, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia before 2010 (Fig. 2). Of note, a tribasic PAKSKR/G-motif of G1-like virus occurred in Bangladesh since 2010, with PAKSKR/G-motif viruses occurring in almost all H9N2 viruses during 2011-2019 (Fig. 1c,e). Notably, the PAASDR/G-motif of H9N2 viruses had been circulating in most European and North American countries. The HACS of Y439-like viruses was more polymerous in migratory birds, mainly including the PATSGR/G, PAASDR/G, and PAASYR/G motifs.Fig. 1: Evolutionary history of HACS of the influenza A(H9N2) viruses.a Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogeny of the H9N2 influenza virus HA gene.

Data are available from the GISAID’s EpiFlu Database, GenBank Database, the World Health Organization, the World Organisation for Animal Health, and the National Health and Family Planning Commission of the People’s Republic of China. The map was designed using ArcGIS Desktop 10.4 software (http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgis-for-desktop/).Full size imageThe P2 and P4 positions at cleavage sites of H9N2 viruses influence the viral replication and cleavage efficiencyA reverse genetic system of an H9N2 virus, A/chicken/Guangdong/V/2008 (rV08-PARSSR), with an HA-PARSSR/G cleavage motif, was established previously28. Different H9N2 viruses with monobasic, dibasic, and tribasic cleavage sites were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Supplementary Data 1), including the PSRSSR/G, PAKSSR/G, PAKSKR/G, and PAASDR/G cleavage motifs. To compare the replicative abilities of the H9N2 viruses, we inoculated Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and chicken embryo fibraoblasts (CEF) cells with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 and 0.001, respectively. Then, we determined the viral titers of supernatants at 12, 24, 36, and 48 h post-infection (hpi) after infection. In MDCK cells, the growth rate of rV08-PSRSSR and rV08-PAKSKR were higher than that of parental virus (Fig. 3a; Supplementary Data 2). By contrast, the replication of rV08-PAASDR markedly decreased compared with that of the parental virus at each time point (Fig. 3a; Supplementary Data 2). In CEF cells, the replicative ability of the rV08-PAKSSR, rV08-PSRSSR, and rV08-PAKSKR was not significant when compared with that of the parental virus. However, the rV08-PAASDR grew to a lower titer at each time point (Fig. 3b; Supplementary Data 3). To determine the influence of the H9N2 viruses on the activation of the cleavage of the HA precursor HA0, a Western blot analysis was performed with virus-infected A549 and CEF cell cultures inoculated with H9N2 viruses at an MOI of 0.01 in the presence of 1 μg/ml tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin for 24 h. Our results showed that the cleavage efficiencies of CEF-grown and A549-grown rV08-PARSSR, rV08-PAKSSR, rV08-PSRSSR, and rV08-PAKSKR were similar, while the CEF-grown and A549-grown HA0 precursors of rV08-PAASDR could not be efficiently cleaved, although bearing supplemental TPCK-treated trypsin (Fig. 3d, e; Supplementary Figs. 1–2). In addition, we determined the cleavage efficiency of H9N2 viruses at different concentrations of TPCK-treated trypsin in the CEF cells (Supplementary Figs. 1–2), and we found that the rV08-PSRSSR and rV08-PAKSKR displayed no significant cleavage efficiency than did the parental virus. These results suggested that the P2 and P4 positions of HACS was crucial to viral replication and cleavage efficiency.Fig. 3: The biological characteristics of influenza A(H9N2) in vivo and in vitro.Growth curves after inoculation of each virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 into (a) MDCK cells and at an MOI of 0.001 into (b) CEF cells. Each point on the curve is the mean ± standard deviation from three independent experiments. The independent-samples t test was used for analysis. c Thermo stability of the influenza A(H9N2) viruses. The influenza A(H9N2) viruses were incubated for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 h at 50 °C. The titers of heat-treated recombination viruses were determined by TCID50 assay in MDCK cells. Western blots of CEF (d) and A549 (e) cell cultures inoculated with five influenza A(H9N2) virus at an MOI of 0.01 in the presence of 1 μg/ml trypsin for 24 h. f Syncytia formation induced by five influenza A(H9N2) viruses in Vero cells. Cultures of Vero cells were inoculated with H9N2 viruses at MOI of 1 for 16 h, followed by incubation with 10 μg/ml of TPCK-trypsin for 15 min to cleave expressed HA0. To induce syncytia formation, Vero cells were incubated for 5 min with fusion buffers of pH values ranging from 5.0 to 5.8, with 0.2 unit increments, and were visualized 3 h later. Representative images at pH values of 5.0 to 5.8 derived from three replicates are shown. Five groups of ten 5-week-old SPF chickens were infected intranasally with 106 EID50/200 μL of each virus. g Viral titers in the lungs of three inoculated chickens. h Viral titers in the duodenum of three inoculated chickens. i Viral titers in the kidney of three inoculated chickens. j Viral titers in the brain of three inoculated chickens. k Antibody titers of inoculated and exposed chickens at 14 dpi. An HI titer ≥1:16 was considered seroconversion. Five groups of three female BALB/c mice were intranasally inoculated with 106 EID50/50 μL of the H9N2 viruses. Three mice from each group were euthanized at 4 dpi. Viral titers in the mouse lungs (l) were shown. The dashed lines represent the detection limit. The independent-samples t test was used for analysis.Full size imageThe P2 and P4 positions at cleavage sites of H9N2 viruses influence the pH stability and thermostabilityHere, we investigated the influence of the HA cleavage mutations on thermal stability. In contrast to the other H9N2 viruses, the rV08-PAKSKR virus displayed a significantly increased infectious titer after incubation at 5 hpi compared with the parental H9N2 viruses (Fig. 3c; Supplementary Data 4). In contrast, the rV08-PAASDR virus were observed to be less stable than the parental virus at each time point (Fig. 3c; Supplementary Data 4). No significant difference was observed for the rV08-PAKSSR and rV08-PSRSSR viruses when compared to the parental virus (Fig. 3c; Supplementary Data 4). These results demonstrated that the tribasic H9N2 virus was more stable; however, the monobasic H9N2 virus was less stable than the other cleavage motif viruses. To assess the acid stability of the five H9N2 viruses, a syncytium formation assay was performed to measure the pH threshold required for HA-mediated cell-to-cell fusion. Vero cells were inoculated with the five H9N2 viruses and exposed to trypsin to cleave and activate the HA; subsequently, the cell culture was acidified with a pH gradient of pH 5.0, 5.2, 5.4, 5.6, and 5.8. Visual inspection of the cell cultures for the presence of syncytia was used to determine the pH threshold triggering the conformational change and subsequent membrane fusion. The pH values at which cell-to-cell fusion was triggered by PARSSR/G, PAKSSR/G, PSRSSR/G, and PAASDR/G-motif viruses were 5.6, 5.6, 5.4, and 5.4, respectively (Fig. 3f). However, the pH value at which cell-to-cell fusion of the PAKSKR/G-motif virus occurred was 5.2 (Fig. 3f), indicating that the P2 and P4 position at cleavage site affect the cell-to-cell fusion activation of H9N2 viruses.The P2 and P4 positions at cleavage site influence the virulence and transmissibility of H9N2 virus in chickensTo determine which cleavage site mutations abolished the virulence and transmissibility in chickens, ten 5-week-old White Leghorn specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens were intranasally inoculated with 106 50% egg infection dose (EID50)/200 μl of H9N2 viruses. After 24 h, the ten uninfected chickens were housed with the inoculated groups. All of the H9N2 viruses could be detected in lung samples from the inoculated chickens except with the rV08-PAASDR group (Fig. 3g; Supplementary Data 5). Remarkably, the inoculated and exposed chickens of rV08-PAKSKR group showed elevated virus output from the duodenum samples (Fig. 3h; Supplementary Data 5). The viral titers of rV08-PAKSKR could be detected in the duodenum samples of inoculated and exposed chickens, with an average of the ~102.2 log10EID50/200 μl and ~101.5 log10EID50/200 μl, respectively (Supplementary Data 5). No virus was detected in the kidney and brain samples of inoculated chickens of each group (Fig. 3i, j; Supplementary Data 5).In addition, virus shedding was also detected in tracheal and cloacal swab speciments at 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 day post-inoculation (dpi). The inoculated chickens in the rV08-PARSSR, rV08-PAKSSR, rV08-PSRSSR, and rV08-PAASDR group shed viruses at 3 and 5 dpi; however, virus shedding in the rV08-PAKSKR group lasted for 7 dpi (Supplementary Data 6). The virus in the trachea of all inoculated chickens exhibited robust shedding at 3 dpi and 5 dpi, whereas the cloacal virus shedding showed different time points of each group. The rV08-PAASDR virus shedding from the trachea only lasted for 3 days; however, the other groups shed comparable levels of infectious virus from the trachea until 7 dpi (Supplementary Data 6). Notably, the rV08-PAKSKR virus showed cloacal virus shedding in all of the inoculated chickens at 3 dpi and 5 dpi, but the other H9N2 viruses were shed via the cloacal route by less than half of the inoculated chickens at each time point (Supplementary Data 6). The transmission study showed that the exposed chickens in the rV08-PAASDR group failed to shed viruses and exhibited no seroconversion (Fig. 3k; Supplementary Data 7). Remarkably, the parental and other recombinant viruses were able to transmit to exposed chickens. Virus shedding of the exposed chickens in the rV08-PARSSR, rV08-PAKSSR, and rV08-PSRSSR groups mostly peaked from 5 to 7 dpi and decreased after 9 dpi. In the rV08-PSRSSR group, however, 4/7 exposed chickens had detectable trachea virus shedding at 9 dpi, while the parental virus was not shed (Supplementary Data 6). Of the rV08-PAKSKR virus, there appeared that the exposed chickens shed virus at the highest level and for the longest duration. The exposed chickens in this group shed virus via cloacal and tracheal routes at 5, 7 and 9 dpi, and the number of chickens shedding in the rV08-PAKSKR virus-infected group was more than that of the rV08-PAASDR H9N2 viruses at 7 and 9 dpi (Supplementary Data 6). Collectively, the results showed that the H9N2 virus possessing the monobasic PAASDR/G cleavage motif did not cause a productive infection and transmission in chickens; however, the tribasic H9N2 virus conferred a greater severity of infection and transmissibility, more prolonged shedding, and digestive viral spread in chickens.The tribasic H9N2 virus enhanced the pathogenicity in miceTo investigate the effects of H9N2 viruses containing different cleavage sites in mammals, 106 EID50/50 μl of each virus was intranasally inoculated into 4-week-old female BALB/c mice. All five H9N2 viruses could replicate efficiently in the lungs of the inoculated mice by 4 dpi. There was no significance in the titers of the rV08-PAKSSR viruses compared with those of the parental rV08-PARSSR virus. However, the rV08-PAKSKR (0.001 < p < 0.01) in the lungs was significantly higher than the parental rV08-PARSSR virus at 4 dpi, while the virus titers of rV08-PAASDR virus in the lungs was lower than that of the rV08-PARSSR virus (0.0001 < p < 0.001) (Fig. 3l; Supplementary Data 5). No H9N2 viruses were detected in the brains infected with the rV08-PARSSR, rV08-PAKSSR, and rV08-PAASDR viruses. However, the H9N2 viruses had been detected in one mice brain infected with the rV08-PSRSSR and rV08-PAKSKR virus (Supplementary Data 5).The enlarged stem-loop RNA secondary structure of the cleavage sites in H9N2 virus accelerated the nucleotide insertions in the HACSTo evaluate the frequency of the nucleotide insertions in the distinct HACS regions of H9N2 viruses, we comprehensively compared the stem-loop structures of different cleavage site regions in H5, H7, and H9 subtype viruses. Compared with low pathogenic H5 and H7 subtype precursors, the well-positioned loop structure occurred less frequency in the HACS of most H9 subtype viruses, and the locations and sizes of the stem-loop structure of distinct cleavage site regions in H9N2 viruses were not significant enough (Supplementary Figs. 3–5). The HACS of most H9N2 viruses usually contain one small stem-loop structure consisting of six nucleotides, which include the successive adenines or guanines (5’-AGGGGA-3’). However, the locations of the stem-loop structure changed when the cleavage sites were varied, resulting in two or three small discontinuous stem-loop structures (Fig. 4c; Supplementary Figs. 6–8). Interestingly, the stem-loop structure of one tribasic cleavage site, the PAKSKR/G motif circulating in Bangladesh, tended to be larger than those of the HACS of H9N2 viruses (Fig. 4c; Supplementary Figs. 6–8). This large stem-loop structure of the HACS consisted of ten nucleotides and fully included the codons for the successive adenine or guanine (5’-AAAAAGAGGA-3’).Fig. 4: Quickfold-predicted RNA structures of the HA cleavage sites and luciferase activity in DF-1 cells.DF-1 cells were transfected with plasmid. The predicted RNA secondary structures of each HA cleavage site motif and amino acids corresponding to each codon are shown. Nucleotides different from the PARSSR/G-motif are shown in red. a Luciferase activities were expressed relative to the Link30-PARSSR plasmid and compared among the reporter plasmids containing the different linkers, including Link28-PARSSR, Link29-PARSSR, Link29-PSRSSR, Link29-PAKSSR, Link29-PAKSKR, Link29-PAASDR, Link29-PAKKKR, Link29-PAKSKR-NL, and Link29-PAKKKR-NL. Each point on the curve is the mean ± standard deviation from three independent experiments. The independent-samples t test was used for analysis. b The linker 29 and 30 polynucleotides were inserted between a start codon and the firefly luciferase gene lacking its start codon. c Quickfold-prediction RNA structures of the HACS sequences. The predicted RNA secondary structure of rV08-PARSSR (i), rV08-PAKSSR (ii), rV08-PSRSSR (iii), rV08-PAASDR (iv), rV08-PAKSKR (v), rV08-PAKSKR-NL (vi), rV08-PAKKKR (vii), and rV08-PAKKKR-NL (viii) are shown. Nucleotides different from the parental rV08-PARSSR are shown in red.Full size imageTo assess the correlation between the frequency of the nucleotide insertions and the stem-loop structures of distinct HACS, a reporter assay24 was established to detect the nucleotide insertions in the RNA sequences encoding the amino acids in the HACS (containing 29 nucleotides) of the rV08-PARSSR virus (Supplementary Fig. 9). In our reporter plasmids, the firefly luciferase gene lacking its start codon was inserted downstream of the start codon, and the firefly luciferase was expressed when nucleotides were inserted into the cleavage site regions to make the sequence in frame with the open reading frame (ORF) (Fig. 4b). To test this system, the chicken fibroblast (DF-1) cells were transfected with the Link29-PARSSR and Link30-PARSSR plasmids, and the luciferase activities were measured. We observed that a high level of luciferase activity upon transfection with the Link30-PARSSR compared with Link29-PARSSR (Fig. 4a; Supplementary Data 8). Next, we constructed the reporter plasmids with different cleavage site motifs (i.e., PARSSR/G, PSRSSR/G, PAKSSR/G, PAKSKR/G, and PAASDR/G) and compared the luciferase activities. Our results showed that the Link29-PAKSKR significantly enhanced the luciferase expression compared with the Link29-PARSSR plasmid, while the luciferase activities did not increase when transfected with the other reporter plasmids (Fig. 4a; Supplementary Data 8). We then constructed the Link29-PAKKKR plasmid, which further enlarged the stem-loop structure of HACS. We found that a significantly increase of luciferase activity in the Link29-PAKKKR. These findings indicated that the enlarged stem-loop structures accelerated the nucleotide insertions into the cleavage site. To further confirm our hypothesis, we constructed another modified Link29-PAKSKR-NL and Link29-PAKKKR-NL plasmids, which were artificially designed to have consecutive adenines and to minimize the loop structures (Fig. 4c). As expected, compared to the enlarged loop structure of Link29-PAKKKR, the significantly lower luciferase expression was observed in the DF-1 cells when transfected with Link29-PAKKKR-NL; however, the difference of luciferase expression between Link29-PAKSKR and Link29-PAKSKR-NL was not significant (Fig. 4a; Supplementary Data 8). These findings suggested that the enlarged stem-loop magnitude was correlated with the efficiency of luciferase expression.To verify the presence of nucleotide insertions in the different HACS of H9N2 viruses, we analyzed the linker RNA of different HACS in the DF-1 cells when transfected with different plasmids, including Link29-PARSSR, Link29-PAKSSR, Link29-PSRSSR, Link29-PAKSKR, Link29-PAKKKR, and Link29-PAASDR plasmids. Using Sanger sequencing, the single-nucleotide and double-nucleotide insertions or double-nucleotide deletion occurred in the synthetize of mRNA or vRNA in the enlarged stem-loop RNA secondary structure of HACS in H9N2 viruses, while no insertions were observed in the linker RNA of other HACS motif of H9N2 viruses when transfected with other plasmids (Supplementary Fig. 10), indicating that the enlarged stem-loop structure accelerated frequency of the nucleotide insertion.The enlarged RNA secondary stem-loop structure of HACS do not influence viral replication in H9N2 virusTo assess the correlation between the viral replication and the enlarged stem-loop structures of HACS, we constructed the synonymous mutation of the HACS in H9N2 virus, designating rV08-PAKSKR-S, which could minimize the stem-loop structures of HACS (Fig. 5a). The replicative ability of the rV08-PAKSKR-S was not significant when compared with that of rV08-PAKSKR. Subsequently, we restored the size of stem-loop structure of HACS and found that the replicative ability of the H9N2 viruses did not increase (Fig. 5b; Supplementary Data 9), indicating that viral replication was not responsible for the enlarged RNA secondary stem-loop structure in H9N2 viruses. We then analyzed the three-dimensional (3D) structural basis of the different HACS in H9N2 viruses. The structure of HACS showed that, with the exposed conformation, the cleavage site loop with K at residue 319 was more exposed to the glycoprotein surface, and thus, the potential proteases could more easily access the cleavage site. However, when the residue at P2 and P4 were both non-basic amino acids, the residues potentially blocked the surface and were not exposed in the same way, resulting in the poor potential protease access (Fig. 5c). These findings indicated that the viral replication was not responsible for the enlarged RNA secondary stem-loop structure of the tribasic H9N2 virus, and however, possibly due to the 3D amino acids structure of the HA protein.Fig. 5: The structures of the tribasic HA cleavage sites and growth property of tribasic H9N2 viruses.a The predicted RNA secondary structures of tribasic HA cleavage sites and amino acids corresponding to each codon are shown. The Quickfold program (http://unafold.rna.albany.edu/?qDINAMelt/Quickfold) and RNAfold program from the ViennaRNA Web Services (http:/na.tbi.univie.ac.at/) and the ViennaRNA package were used to predict RNA sequences of the cleavage site regions of the HA genes. b Growth curves after inoculation of each virus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.001 into MDCK cell. Each point on the curve is the mean ± standard deviation from three independent experiments. c Three-dimensional (3D) structural analysis of amino acids at the HA cleavage site. A side view of the HA trimer structure of influenza A virus based on the uncleaved H3 monomer (protein Data Bank ID 4BSE) as a template. The corresponding amino acids to a 3D structure of the HA protein containing different cleavage motifs were mapped using MacPymol (http://www.pymol.org/).Full size imageUsing the predicted mutation plots to trace the evolution of HACS in H9N2 virusesA bioinformatics tool described by Lee DW29, AAScatterPlot, was used to represent the diversity of amino acid residues at the HA proteolytic cleavage site from P6 to P1. The scatter plots showed the diversity and rare residues at each position more clearly than the WebLogo. The size and color of the dots corresponded to the frequency of occurrence and the unique properties of the residue (green = polar neutral, blue = polar positive, red = polar negative, brown = proline or glycine, teal = bonding cysteine, and gray = nonpolar aliphatic). A random point mutation of a residue in a codon was indicated with a hollow circle overlaying the scatter plots. In our study, we found that the P6 and P1 positions were stable as compared to other residues during the viral evolution. However, substitutions with hydrophobic residues were observed in the P4 and P3 (Fig. 6a). The P5 and P2 seemed to mutate in a defined region, and P2 seemed to prefer hydrophilic residues during 2010 to 2019 (Supplementary Fig. 11). We then indicated an ‘Avoided Region’ to show the biochemical properties, which was unfavorable for the P2 mutation (Fig. 6b). AAScatterPlot was also used to predict the restricted evolutionary paths of the HA proteolytic cleavage site. According to the tool, we found that there would be two major paths for the P2 position to mutate between residues G and N, including S⇄G⇆D or S⇄N⇆K (Fig. 6b), which supported that the transition between P2 D and K would most likely involve a P2 G and N intermediate, respectively. It is noteworthy that the P2 N was increasing in the G1 and Y280 lineage H9N2 viruses in recent years (Supplementary Fig. 11), which indicated that the possible path for the P2 position from N to K. These findings suggested that the P2 residue was experiencing a selection pressure, and the tendency of the HACS evolving from dibasic to tribasic was observed in H9N2 viruses.Fig. 6: Scatter plot of the HA proteolytic cleavage site.a Scatter plots of each AA residue at the HACS of 1550 HA sequences. The X-axis is HPI (unitless), and the Y-axis is Y-axis is VdWV (Å3). b Scatter plots for P2 position residues. Potential mutation pathways are shown by an arrow. An “Avoided Region” was marked to show the biochemical properties that appear to be unfavorable for the P2 position mutation.Full size imageDiscussionThe H9N2 virus was one of the major subtype of influenza viruses circulating in poultry worldwide that causes significant economic losses to the poultry industries and threatens human health5,7. Because influenza A(H9N2) viruses were low pathogenic to birds and had only sporadically infected humans with mild or asymptomatic symptom, their eradication had not been a priority for zoonosis control agencies in many countries. This neglect caused them to continue to share genetic materials with other HP influenza virus of public health significance. Cleavage activation of HA by host protease is a crucial step in the life cycle of influenza virus and ultimately influence the virulence, transmissibility between hosts and adaption to new species20,30,31,32. The minimum sequence requirement of H9N2 viruses is R/K-X-X-R, which consisted of two paired arginine/lysine residues at the P1 and P4 position. However, we found that the HACS of H9N2 virus showed the avoidance of hydrophobic residues at the P2 and P5 positions, and the P2 position seems tolerant of large variations in biochemical properties, especially S337K substitution. Interestingly, our findings showed the mutation pathways that a virus can take to transition between a P2 S and K via a N (Fig. 6b), indicating that P2 residues are experiencing a selection pressure during virus evolution.This study demonstrated that during serial passaging in chickens, the P2 position at HACS of the H9N2 virus was more polymorphic, and the amino acids N337K in the P2 position detected in the 6th passage33. The G1-lineage H9N2 viruses were adapted to birds and humans and induced more severe infections than the other representative lineage of H9N2 virus, and a basic amino acid in the P3 position of HACS formed an intermediate step towards a gain in pathogenicity34. In this study, we found that a sharp increase occurred after 2010 in the G1-lineage of H9N2 viruses with an identical HACS of the tribasic PAKSKR/G-motif from Bangladesh. Previous study showed that the tribasic H9N2 viruses can be activated by matriptase and furin22,35. It is noteworthy that all SARS-CoV-2 harbor tribasic cleavage sites, which are activated by ubiquitously expressed furin36. Furin and matriptase are mainly expressed in the kidneys and human lungs, indicating the potential to infect humans of H9N2 viruses. Our findings suggested that the predominant tribasic H9N2 virus increased the replicative ability, viral stability, and digestive virus spread in chickens (Fig. 7), which explains the selective evolution in the HACS that increase viral fitness in chickens. In addition, when the residues at P2 and P4 were both non-basic amino acids, the H9N2 virus dramatically reduced the stability, cleavage efficiency, pathogenicity and transmission in chickens (Fig. 7), indicating a decrease in viral fitness of monobasic H9N2 viruses. The North American-like and Y439-like H9N2 sublineages with P2 D had difficulty infecting chickens and pigs37, and this prototype virus did not become a dominant variant and cause human infection in China, which might be responsible for the lack of its transmission to birds.Fig. 7: Graphic summary of H9N2 viruses containing the different cleavage site motifs in vivo and in vitro.The up arrow and down arrow indicate the increase and decease, respectively.Full size imageThe secondary structures of RNA molecules were important for the RNA editing mechanism38. The insertions encoding for multibasic cleavage site motifs in the HA gene of HP H5 and H7 subtype viruses occurred in the hairpin loops of the stem-loop structures flanking the cleavage site regions39. Compared to the RNA structures of cleavage sites among H5 and H7 subtype viruses, the stem-loop structure of H9N2 viruses tended to be smaller. However, interestingly, we found that the stem-loop structure of PAKSKR/G-motif was obviously larger than that of the other HACS, and it significantly enhanced the luciferase expression compared with the reporter plasmid containing the PARSSR/G-motif, which suggested that this enlarged stem-loop structure was important to accelerate the nucleotide insertion in HACS, indicating potential threats of acquiring the polybasic cleavage sites of H9N2 viruses. Although we observed that the tribasic cleavage site motif accelerated the nucleotide insertion in HACS, we cannot determine whether the tribasic H9 virus could evolve to become HP in chickens and posed increased threat to humans. Previous study indicated that the introduction of polybasic amino acid residues at the HACS of H9N2 virus alone could not acquire high pathogenicity in birds40, unless it undergoes a series of passages in chickens. HP is a generalized phenotype determined by a series of complex genotype changes in influenza virus, which could arise from different combinations of adaptive mutations and reassortment. In addition, disrupt of the HACS structure in H5 subtype mutant viruses generated by reverse genetics did not reveal any effect on viral replication41. Consistent with their findings, we found that enlarged RNA secondary stem-loop structure in H9N2 viruses could not increase the viral replication, indicating that no direct correlation between conservation of the RNA structure of influenza virus and their functional importance.Due to the controversy of the gain-of-function study, we did not passage the tribasic or polybasic H9N2 viruses in chickens to explore the pathogenicity determinant of HP H9N2 viruses. However, it is noteworthy that the H9N2 viruses bearing the tribasic or polybasic cleavage sites with the internal genes of H5N1 viruses obviously enhanced the pathogenicity in chickens. Bangladesh and Egypt had been identified as a “hotspot” of H9N2 and H5N1 evolution in multiple avian species25,42. Although it remains speculative, the increasing tribasic H9N2 viruses suggests that a substantial potential to generate novel reassortants with greater fitness in avian and mammalian species, and in turn, evolving into the HP phenotype. The Middle East, south Asia, and Africa in particular have an important role in the global dissemination of H9N2 virus, since these countries here lie along major migratory bird pathways–the central Asian, east Africa-west Asian, and Black Sea-Mediterranean routes. Considering these concern, it should be noted that the transmission of the H9N2 virus accelerates the spread and reassortment of novel human-infecting influenza viruses. Our findings initially offer insights into the evolutionary dynamics of HACS of H9N2 viruses and risk assessment regarding which predominant cleavage site motifs may pose the great threat for zoonotic and pandemic emergence in birds and humans.MethodsEthics statement and biosafetyAll experiments with reverse H9N2 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) were conducted in an animal biosafety level 3 laboratory and animal facilities at South China Agricultural University (SCAU) (CNAS BL0011) in accordance with protocols. All animals involved in the experiments were reviewed and approved by the Institution Animal Care and Use Committee at SCAU and treated in accordance with the guidelines (2017A002).Data collectionAll of the human-infecting influenza A (H9N2) cases data were obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO) (http://www.who.int/en/), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (EMPRES-I data sets) (http://empres-i.fao.org/eipws3g/#h=1), and the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China (http://en.nhfpc.gov.cn/). We performed a systematic search using PubMed, Internet-based, the Weekly Epidemiological Record (WER) of WHO for serological evidence of human infection. The global distributions of influenza A (H9N2) viruses in birds and humans were available from GenBank (http:/cbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) and GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org) and evaluated using GraphPad Prism 7 (https://www.graphpad.com/) and ArcGIS 10.4 for Desktop (http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgis-for-desktop/).Virus isolation and cellsThe virus used, the H9N2 virus A/chicken/Guangdong/V/2008 (rV08-PARSSR) (PB2, EPI1383190; PB1, EPI1383191; PA, EPI1383192; HA, EPI1383193; NP, EPI1383194; NA, EPI1383195; M, EPI1383196; NS, EPI1383197) was isolated from ostensibly healthy chickens in a poultry farm in Guangdong Province of China in 2008. Each segment used in this study is available in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database (http://www.gisaid.org/). The H9N2 virus was propagated in the allantoic cavities of 10-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs at 37 °C for 60 h and then were stored viruses at −80 °C until use. All cells used, including human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells, MDCK cells, A549 cells, CEFs cells, Vero cells, and DF-1 cells were provided by the National Avian Influenza Para-Reference Laboratory (Guangzhou) at South China Agricultural University. HEK293T, MDCK, A549, and Vero cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, 100U/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. CEFs and DF-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, 100U/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin and incubated at 39 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.Phylogenetic analysis and generation of the biophysical scatter plotsAll of the available genomic sequences with the complete coding regions of influenza A (H9N2) viruses were downloaded from GenBank (http:/cbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) and GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org). The genomic sequence data set (sequence alignments are available on request) was then created. All sequences were aligned using the MAFFT (version 7.149) program (https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/). Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenies for the codon alignment of the genomic gene segments were estimated using the GTRGAMMA nucleotide substitution model in the RAxML (version 8.2) program. Node support was determined by nonparametric bootstrapping with 1000 replicates. The phylogenetic tree was visualized with the FigTree (version 1.4.3) program (http:/ree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). The AAscaterPlot was coded in MATLAB (MathWorks), and the source codes and installation file were provided at http://github.com/WhittakerLab/AAScaterPlot.Plasmid construction and reverse geneticsEight gene segments from the A/chicken/Guangdong/V/2008 (rV08-PARSSR) strain were cloned into the Hoffmann’s bidirectional transcription vector pHW2000 plasmid system43, as described previously. The parental and HA mutant constructs (rV08-PAKSSR, rV08-PSRSSR, rV08-PAKSKR, and rV08-PAASDR) were produced by site-directed mutagenesis PCR and then sequenced. The recombinant H9N2 viruses were designated rV08-PARSSR, rV08-PSRSSR, rV08-PAKSSR, rV08-PAKSKR, and rV08-PAASDR, respectively. The five H9N2 viruses were generated using reverse genetics. Briefly, HEK293T cell monolayers in 6-well plates were transfected at 80-90% confluency with 4 μg of the eight plasmids (500 ng of each plasmid) by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA and transfection reagent were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 5 min, and added to the cells. Four hours later, the mixture was replaced with Opti-MEM (GIBCO) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 1 μg/ml trypsin. After 48 h, the supernatant was harvested and injected into SPF embryonated eggs for virus propagation. Viruses were titrated in embryonated eggs using hemagglutination assays, as recommended by the WHO manual on influenza diagnosis and surveillance. All mutant viruses were confirmed by RT-PCR and sequencing.Animal experimentsFor the chicken experiment, groups of ten 5-week-old SPF chickens (Guangdong Dahuanong Animal Health Products Co., Ltd., Guangdong Province, China) were inoculated intranasally with 106 EID50/200 μl of the five H9N2 viruses. Chickens were observed for clinical symptoms for 14 days, and serum samples were collected for analysis of virus-specific antibodies. Ten chickens were introduced into the isolators with inoculated chickens 24 h after direct inoculation to assess transmission. Cloacal and throat swab specimens were collected at 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 dpi from the infected and naïve chickens. Three chickens in each group were dissected to test for virus replication in the organs, including the lung, kidney, duodenum, and brain. Tissue and swab samples were collected for virus titration by an EID50 assay. For the mouse experiments, groups of 4-week-old female BALB/c mice, obtained from the Vital River Company in Beijing, were anesthetized with isoflurane and inoculated intranasally with 106 EID50/50 μl viruses. To test for virus replication in the organs, three mice in each group were euthanized at 4 dpi. Tissue samples including brain and lung tissue samples from each euthanized mouse were collected for virus titration by an EID50 assay.Thermal stability and syncytia formation assay to evaluate the threshold pH of HA activationThe thermal stability of the HA protein was measured by determining the loss of the virus titer after incubating the viruses at 50 °C temperature for 1–5 h. The titers of heat-treated H9N2 viruses were determined by TCID50 assay in MDCK cells. Vero cells grown in 24-well plates were inoculated with five H9N2 viruses containing different HACS motifs at an MOI of 1 for 16 h. Vero cell cultures were then treated with 10 μg/ml of TPCK-trypsin (Sigma) at 37 °C for 15 min. To induce syncytia formation, cells were incubated with fusion buffer with the pH adjusted to 5.0, 5.2, 5.4, 5.6, and 5.8 for 5 min at 37 °C. At 3 h post fusion induction, Vero cells were fixed and stained with Giemsa stain (Solarbio Life Science, Beijing, China). Images were taken on a cell imaging system (Leica DM14800B, Germany).Western blottingCEF and A549 cells were inoculated with the H9N2 viruses at an MOI of 0.01 in the presence of either 1 μg/ml TPCK-trypsin for 24 h in minimal essential medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Dingguo, Beijing, China). Proteins from the cell cultures were separated on 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels and then electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Polyclonal rabbit anti-HA antibody from A/Hong Kong/1073/99 H9N2 expressed in baculovirus (1:2000 dilution for 2 h at room temperature; Sino Biological Inc., Beijing, China) was used to detect HA. Goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature; Dingguo, Beijing, China) was used as a secondary antibody, followed by chemiluminescence detection (LI-COR Odyssey). Grayscale analysis of individual bands was determined by using ImageJ, and relative cutting efficiency was calculated according to the equation HA1/(HA0 + HA1).Virus growth kineticsConfluent MDCK cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 TCID50/cell for 1 h at 37 °C, and CEF cells were infected at an MOI of 0.001 TCID50/cell for 1 h at 37 °C. After 1 h incubation, the cells were washed twice, and then incubated with DMEM containing 0.2% BSA (Dingguo, Beijing, China) and TPCK trypsin (1 μg/ml) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Culture supernatants were collected at the indicated time points and stored at −80 °C until use. The MDCK cells infected with rV08-PAKSKR appeared cytopathic effect and began to fall off slightly after 24 hpi. Hence, the mixture of culture supernatants and cell cultures were collected at the indicated time points, and viral titers were determined by the TCID50 assay in MDCK cells.Reporter assayIn brief, we used the modified luciferase reporter plasmid, containing chicken RNA polymerase I promoter, RNA polymerase I terminator, rV08-PARSSR HA segment-derived noncoding region (NCR), and the firefly luciferase gene (Supplementary Fig. S4). The reporter plasmid was constructed by inserting 29-polynucleotide and 30-polynucleotide linkers whose sequences were derived from those encoding the HA cleavage site of the rV08-PARSSR strains, between a start codon and the remaining ORF of the firefly luciferase gene. The construct was flanked by the rV08-PARSSR HA-NCR at both the 5’ and 3’ ends. The RNP complexes, consisting of PA, PB1, PB2, and NP (200 ng each) plasmids of rV08-PARSSR virus, were mixed with a luciferase reporter plasmid (200 ng) and a thymidine kinase promoter-Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid (pRL_TK) construct (20 ng), then co-transfected into DF-1 cells in a 12-well plate with Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and incubated at 39 °C for 24 h. Luciferase production was assayed using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Firefly luciferase activities were standardized to the transfection control Renilla luciferase activities (i.e., firefly luciferase activities were divided by Renilla luciferase activities).To verify the presence of nucleotide insertions in the different HACS of H9N2 viruses, RNA was extracted from the transfected DF-1 cells with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) as directed by the manufacturer. Then, RNA was treated with DNAase (Omega) to eliminate the influence of plasmids. Two-step RT-PCR was conducted with primers (F: 5’-TGTAGGAGATCTTCTAGAAAGATGTTAA-3’; R: 5’-ACTGCATACGACGATTCTGTGATT-3’). PCR products were purified with a QIAamp Gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and cloned into the PJET vector. Recombinant plasmids were maintained under nonselective conditions in Escherichia coli and then ten cloned plasmids of Link29-PARSSR, Link29-PSRSSR, Link29-PAKSSR, Link29-PAKSKR, Link29-PAASDR, and Link29-PAKKKR were sequenced with an ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems), respectively.Prediction of the RNA secondary structureThe Mfold program (http://unafold.rna.albany.edu/?q=mfold), Quickfold program (http://unafold.rna.albany.edu/?qDINAMelt/Quickfold) and RNAfold program from the ViennaRNA Web Services (http:/na.tbi.univie.ac.at/) and the ViennaRNA package were used to predict RNA sequences of the cleavage site regions of the HA genes44. The HACS sequences of low pathogenic H5, H7, and H9 precursors were all avian species (chickens, ducks, and wild birds) available in the GISAID database (http://www.gisaid.org/). Identical HACS sequences were removed. The representative HA sequences of A/chicken/Bangladesh/29588/2016 (H9N2), A/chicken/Zhejiang/221/2016 (H9N2), A/chicken/Shenzhen/9/1997 (H9N2), A/chicken/Egypt/S4454B/2010 (H9N2), and A/wild waterfowl/Korea/7/2010 (H9N2), A/wild_caterfowl/Dongting/C2032/2011 (H9N2) isolates available in the GISAID’s EpiFlu Database (http://www.gisaid.org/) were used for the structural analysis.Structure-based mapping analysisWe predicted the HA monomer structure using the SWISS-Model website (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/), employing the uncleaved H3 monomer (protein Data Bank ID 4BSE) as a template. The corresponding amino acid to a three-dimensional (3D) amino acids structure of the HA protein were mapped using MacPymol (http://www.pymol.org/).Statistical analysis and reproducibilityData are presented as the mean ± SD and analyzed using GrapPad Prism 5.0. The independent-samples t test was applied for analysis, and p values less than 0.05 were considered significant and are represented as *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001. For all statistically significant data from at least two biological repeats performed on separate days was used. The exact number of replicates are presented in individual figure legends. Any differences in statistical significance are indicated.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Mathematical models of disease transmission can support outbreak control efforts by estimating relevant epidemiological parameters. In this article, diagnostic testing data from each house on a premises infected during a LPAI H5N2 outbreak in the state of Minnesota in the United States in 2018 was used to estimate the time of virus introduction and adequate contact rate, which determines the rate of disease spread. A well-defined most likely time of virus introduction, and upper and lower 95% credibility intervals were estimated for each house. The length of the 95% credibility intervals ranged from 11 to 22 with a mean of 17 days. In some houses the contact rate estimates were also well-defined; however, the estimated upper 95% credibility interval bound for the contact rate was occasionally dependent on the upper bound of the prior distribution. The estimated modes ranged from 0.5 to 6.0 with a mean of 2.8 contacts per day. These estimates can be improved with early detection, increased testing of monitored premises, and combining the results of multiple barns that possess similar production systems.

LPAI can place a heavy financial burden on producers due to the reductions in egg production, decreases in bird market weight, and increases in mortality that can occur in infected flocks as well as costs stemming from intensive cleaning and extended downtime1. In addition, H5 and H7 LPAI strains can not only mutate into highly pathogenic avian influenza, a devastating disease in domestic poultry that can cause near 100% mortality in infected flocks2, but their presence in domesticated poultry can also result in significant trade restrictions. Thus, it is critical to limit the spread of virus during an outbreak.Epidemiological investigation is an important part of any LPAI outbreak response. Transmission of LPAI between poultry premises is primarily driven by human activity, for example live bird movements, rendering truck visits to multiple premises, or equipment sharing1. Epidemiological investigation can identify the specific activities responsible for disease spread, allowing for effective mitigation strategies to be implemented that target a specific pathway during an outbreak. The identification of these pathways can also improve understanding of transmission routes, knowledge that can be used to inform future outbreak response. Furthermore, tracing efforts performed as part of an epidemiological investigation can highlight previously unidentified at-risk premises.Information on the time of infection for a house or premises can assist epidemiological investigations by allowing investigators to focus on a specific timeframe, improving the precision of the pathway analysis and tracing efforts. Mathematical modeling can provide such information, estimating a range of possible virus introduction times from outbreak data3,4,5,6,7. Here, the time of virus introduction is estimated using diagnostic testing data from turkey flocks infected during a 2018 LPAI H5N2 outbreak in the state of Minnesota in the United States (U.S.). The likelihood of observing the diagnostic test results given a time of virus introduction was estimated using simulated output from a stochastic disease transmission model.This comparison of simulated and observed data can also be used to reduce uncertainty in the internal parameters of the simulation model, a process known as inverse modelling8. There is substantial uncertainty in the adequate contact rate (also called the transmission parameter) for LPAI in turkeys, which determines the rate of spread in the disease transmission model. To address this uncertainty, the adequate contact rate was jointly estimated with the time of virus introduction for the LPAI infected turkey flocks in Minnesota.To reduce uncertainty and provide disease transmission estimates applicable to epidemiological investigations, we explored an approach to estimate the time of virus introduction and adequate contact rate using diagnostic testing data from LPAI infected turkey flocks. Results are presented for the houses testing virus positive on one of the eight meat-type turkey premises infected during the 2018 LPAI H5N2 outbreak in Minnesota. The performance of the estimation approach was evaluated by applying the method to diagnostic testing data simulated with known parameters for several combinations of scenarios including high and low contact rate scenarios, scenarios varying the time of exposure relative to the sampling time of the first test, and scenarios varying by the amount and frequency of testing performed. Lastly, the method validation was extended to assess the effect of combining the likelihoods from multiple houses on the parameter estimates.Materials and methodsOutbreak dataBirds on eight premises, all meat-type turkey premises, tested positive by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) during the 2018 LPAI H5N2 outbreak in Minnesota. Diagnostic test results were available for each of the 33 barns that tested positive across the eight premises from the time of detection until the birds were sent to processing as part of controlled marketing9. The current article focuses on the estimated time of virus introduction and adequate contact rate results for a single premises, the 2nd premises detected in Kandiyohi county in Minnesota (Kandiyohi 2). Results from the other premises have been reported10. All five barns on Kandiyohi 2 tested positive for virus. The data consisted of the number of birds in each barn, the date swabs for rRT-PCR or serum samples were taken, and the number of positive diagnostic test results. Swabs for rRT-PCR were taken from live birds and tested in pools of 10 or 11 swabs. Serology testing consisted of 10 serum samples tested individually by either agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The Kandiyohi 2 testing data is provided in Supplementary Table S1. All samples were collected and tested under the guidance and authority of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) enacted to guide avian influenza surveillance in poultry as outlined in 9 CFR parts 145, 146, 147 and 5611.Stochastic within-house LPAI transmission modelThe infection prevalence of LPAI and seroprevalence over time simulated from the stochastic within-house transmission model were used to estimate the likelihood of observing the diagnostic test results given different virus exposure times and adequate contact rates. The transmission model for LPAI in broiler breeders from Bonney et al. was reparametrized for LPAI in turkeys12. A summary of the input parameters is given in Table 1. The transmission model tracks the number of birds in the susceptible, latently infected, infectious, recovered, removed (dead), and seroconverted states at each simulation time step, which in this case was set to 0.01 days.Table 1 Input parameters for the stochastic within-house LPAI transmission model.Full size tableThe number of initially infected birds in a house was dependent on whether the house was the first infected on the premises, as deduced from diagnostic testing data. In the house that first tested positive for virus, each transmission run began with a single latently infected bird. The number of initially infected birds was increased for the houses that tested positive for virus at a later date based on the assumption that more virus would be present on the premises and thus likely transmitted to more susceptible birds in neighboring houses. For these houses, the number of initially infected birds was randomly sampled from the integers between one and ten. The number of birds initially infected in non-index barns during an outbreak is unknown given potential on-farm spread due to movement of people or equipment and could be higher than the baseline assumption of one to ten1. Due to the uncertainty in this parameter a sensitivity scenario was evaluated where the interval for the number of initially infected birds was increased from one to fifty. For the results and discussion of this sensitivity analysis see Supplementary Table S9 and Supplementary Table S10.In each proceeding time step, the number of infected birds was simulated from a binomial distribution as follows. Let β be the adequate contact rate, \(N_{I} \left( t \right)\) be the number of infectious birds at time step \(t\), and \(N\left( t \right)\) be the number of birds alive at time step \(t\). The probability of infection in the time interval \(\left( {t, t + \Delta t} \right)\), \(p_{inf} \left( {t,\Delta t} \right)\), is given by the equation13,14:$$p_{inf} \left( {t,\Delta t} \right) = 1 - e^{{\left( { - \beta \frac{{N_{I} \left( t \right)}}{N\left( t \right)}\Delta t} \right)}}$$The length of the time step \(\Delta t\) was set to 0.01 days in this analysis. Next, let \(N_{S} \left( t \right)\) be the number of susceptible birds at time step \(t\). The number of newly infected birds in the time interval \(\left( {t, t + \Delta t} \right)\), \(N_{new\_cases} \left( {t, \Delta t} \right)\), is modeled by the binomial distribution13:$$N_{new\_cases} \left( {t,\Delta t} \right) \sim Binomial\left( {N_{S} \left( t \right), p_{inf} \left( {t,\Delta t} \right)} \right)$$As constructed, any increase in the contact rate increases the probability that a susceptible bird is infected in the simulation time step, resulting in a faster rate of disease spread.Random latent period and infectious period lengths were generated for each infected bird from distributions modeling their respective lengths. Birds transitioned out of the latent and infectious states in the first simulation time step where the randomly generated length was exceeded. The parameters of the latent and infectious period length distributions, assumed to be gamma distributed, were estimated from inoculation study data using a maximum likelihood estimation method. Data involving both H5 and H7 LPAI strains were included due to insufficient data on turkeys inoculated with H5 LPAI strains. The inoculation studies used in the estimation of the latent period distribution include Pillai et al., Iqbal et al., and Pantin-Jackwood et al.15,16,17 and those for the infectious period distribution include Pillai et al., Saenz et al., Iqbal et al., Comin et al., Pantin-Jackwood et al., and Spackman et al.3,15,16,17,18,19.The proportion of birds that die from infection was set to 0.01 based on the low mortality observed in houses infected during this Minnesota LPAI outbreak. The birds designated to die from infection transition from the infectious to the removed state, while the other birds transition to the recovered state. Once a bird is in the removed or recovered state, it remains there for the rest of the simulation.The transition into the seroconverted state occurred as follows. Once a bird was infected, a random number was generated from a distribution modeling the time to seroconversion. A bird transitioned into the seroconverted state in the first time step where this length was exceeded. The time to seroconversion was assumed to be gamma distributed. The parameters of this distribution were estimated from inoculation studies using a maximum likelihood method. Data involving any LPAI virus strain were included due to a scarcity of viable data. The studies used were Dundon et al., Morales, Homme et al., and Preskenis, which involved H4, H6, H7, and H9 LPAI strains20,21,22,23. The proportion of birds that seroconvert was set to 0.99 based on the results of Spackman et al. (2010) in which 88/89 (99%) of the turkeys inoculated with twelve North American H7 LPAI isolates had detectable antibody by day 18 to 21 post-inoculation19.Due to high uncertainty in the parameter estimate for the proportion of birds that die due to infection, a sensitivity analysis was performed where the proportion of birds dying due to disease was set to 0 and 0.04. The Kandiyohi 2 results were identical to the baseline results in the sensitivity analysis, suggesting the estimates are robust to changes in the proportion of infected birds that die due to disease. This is to be expected since only live birds were sampled for testing. There is uncertainty in other parameter estimates such as the shape and scale of the time to seroconversion distribution. More work is required to characterize this uncertainty in the form of prior distributions for these parameters. However, this was reserved for future work in order to focus the paper on the estimation method for the time of virus introduction and adequate contact rate.Estimation of the time of virus introduction and adequate contact rateThe time of virus introduction and the adequate contact rate were estimated for each poultry house using a Bayesian approach. The likelihood of observing the diagnostic test results was estimated given output simulated from the stochastic within-house LPAI transmission model for different virus introduction time and contact rate pairs. Similar to Pinsent et al. (2014), the likelihood of observing a test result was modeled with the binomial distribution4. A summary of the notation used in the following derivation of the estimation method is given in Supplementary Table S2.The probability of observing a pooled rRT-PCR test result, with all swabs taken from live birds, was determined as follows. First, let \(N_{pcr,j}^{swabs}\) be the number of swabs per pool in rRT-PCR test event j. A test event was defined as the testing performed on samples taken at the same time. In the case of Kandiyohi 2, the rRT-PCR test events were comprised of either 3 pooled samples of 11 swabs each or 1 pooled sample of 11 swabs. Let \(\rho_{I,ij} \left( {\beta , t_{intro} } \right)\) be the infection prevalence at the time of sampling for test event j. This prevalence was estimated from the ith LPAI transmission model run simulated with a given contact rate \(\beta\) and time of virus introduction \(t_{intro}\). The probability of including at least one swab from an infectious bird in a single pooled sample taken as part of test event j and based on simulation run i, a probability notated as \(p_{pcr,ij}\), is$$p_{pcr,ij} = 1 - \left( {1 - \rho_{I,ij} \left( {\beta , t_{intro} } \right)} \right)^{{N_{pcr,j}^{swabs} }}$$Next, let \(N_{pcr,j}^{tests}\) be the total number of pooled rRT-PCR samples tested as part of test event j and \(N_{pcr,j}^{pos}\) be the number of pooled samples that tested positive in test event j. Both \(N_{pcr,j}^{tests}\) and \(N_{pcr,j}^{pos}\) were observed from the field data. Finally, let \(Se_{pcr}\) be the rRT-PCR test sensitivity, in this case equal to 0.9024. The probability of observing \(N_{pcr,j}^{pos}\) given contact rate \(\beta\) and time of virus introduction \(t_{intro}\) and based on output from transmission run i is$$P_{i} \left( {N_{pcr,j}^{pos} | \beta , t_{intro} } \right) = \left( {\begin{array}{*{20}c} {N_{pcr,j}^{tests} } \\ {N_{pcr,j}^{pos} } \\ \end{array} } \right)\left( {Se_{pcr} p_{pcr,ij} } \right)^{{N_{pcr,j}^{pos} }} \left( {1 - Se_{pcr} p_{pcr,ij} } \right)^{{N_{pcr,j}^{tests} - N_{pcr,j}^{pos} }}$$The probability of observing a serology test result was determined similarly. Let \(N_{sero,k}^{tests}\) be the number of serum samples taken as part of serology test event k and \(N_{sero,k}^{pos}\) be the number of those samples that test positive, where both \(N_{sero,k}^{tests}\) and \(N_{sero,k}^{pos}\) were observed in the field data. Next, let \(\rho_{S,ik} \left( {\beta , t_{intro} } \right)\) be the seroprevalence in the flock at the time of sampling for test event k, estimated from the ith disease transmission model simulation run given contact rate \(\beta\) and time of virus introduction \(t_{intro}\). Last of all, let \(Se_{sero}\) be the AGID or ELISA test sensitivity, in this case set equal to 1.0025. A sensitivity analysis was performed for the \(Se_{sero}\) parameter where the time of virus introduction and adequate contact rate were estimated from the Kandiyohi 2 diagnostic test data considering an AGID or ELISA test sensitivity of 0.98. Little difference was observed in the results of the sensitivity analysis compared to the baseline. Results are given in Supplementary Table S7 and Supplementary Table S8. The probability of observing \(N_{sero,k}^{pos}\) given contact rate \(\beta\) and time of virus introduction \(t_{intro}\) and based on the output from the ith iteration of the disease transmission model is$$P_{i} \left( {N_{sero,k}^{pos} | \beta , t_{intro} } \right) = \left( {\begin{array}{*{20}c} {N_{sero,k}^{tests} } \\ {N_{sero,k}^{pos} } \\ \end{array} } \right)\left( {Se_{sero} \rho_{S,ik} \left( {\beta , t_{intro} } \right)} \right)^{{N_{sero,k}^{pos} }} \left( {1 - Se_{sero} \rho_{S,ik} \left( {\beta , t_{intro} } \right)} \right)^{{N_{sero,k}^{tests} - N_{sero,k}^{pos} }}$$The samples taken for rRT-PCR and serology testing were performed without replacement, meaning a hypergeometric distribution would provide a more exact probability of observing the test result. However, due to the large population size in the houses (over 7200 turkeys in each barn) compared to the size of the samples taken for testing (no more than 33 turkeys sampled for rRT-PCR and 10 turkeys sampled for serology testing), a binomial distribution can serve as an appropriate substitute. As its implementation was more straightforward, a binomial approximation was used in this analysis.The likelihood of observing the set of diagnostic test results in a house for a given contact rate and time of virus introduction was estimated by taking the average across the 10,000 simulation iterations of the product of the individual test probabilities. Let \(N_{iterations}\) be the number of transmission model simulation iterations run for each contact rate and time of virus introduction pair. Let \(N_{pcr}\) be the total number of rRT-PCR test events and \(N_{sero}\) be the total number of serology test events. The likelihood of observing the diagnostic test results given contact rate \(\beta\) and time of virus introduction \(t_{intro}\) is$$l\left( { x | \beta , t_{intro} } \right) = \frac{{\mathop \sum \nolimits_{i = 1}^{{N_{iterations} }} \mathop \prod \nolimits_{j = 1}^{{N_{pcr} }} P_{i} \left( {N_{pcr,j}^{pos} | \beta , t_{intro} } \right)\mathop \prod \nolimits_{k = 1}^{{N_{sero} }} P_{i} \left( {N_{sero,k}^{pos} | \beta , t_{intro} } \right)}}{{N_{iterations} }}$$The prior distributions for the contact rate and time of virus introduction were assumed to be uniform distributed. The distribution for the contact rate had a minimum of 0.1 and maximum of 6.0 contacts per day, which was set based on LPAI and HPAI contact rate estimates for turkeys in the literature3,18,26,27,28,29. The latest time of virus introduction that was evaluated was the time of sampling for the first positive diagnostic test result observed in the data. The earliest time of virus introduction that was evaluated was 80 days prior to the sampling time of the last diagnostic test taken from the house.Due to the low dimensionality of this problem (two parameters to be estimated), the parameter space defined by the prior distributions was explored using a grid-based method. The contact rate was incremented by 0.1 steps while the time of virus introduction was incremented by 0.25 day steps. The likelihood was estimated for each combination of contact rate and virus introduction and then normalized to obtain a posterior distribution. Let \(\pi \left( {\beta , t_{intro} } \right)\) be the prior distribution for the contact rate and time of virus introduction. The posterior distribution, \(p\left( {\beta , t_{intro} |x} \right)\), was determined by$$p\left( {\beta , t_{intro} |x} \right) = \frac{{l(x|\beta , t_{intro} )\pi \left( {\beta , t_{intro} } \right)}}{{\mathop \sum \nolimits_{\beta } \mathop \sum \nolimits_{{t_{intro} }} l\left( {x|\beta , t_{intro} } \right)\pi \left( {\beta , t_{intro} } \right)}}$$A posterior distribution was estimated for each house following this approach.Multiple house estimation approachThe single house likelihoods can be conditioned on the results from other houses with similar production characteristics (e.g. similar housing structures and bird ages) with the goal of improving the parameter estimates. Houses with similar production characteristics were assumed to have the same contact rate. Therefore, the likelihoods from these other houses represent a source of additional information.The contact rate and time of virus introduction were estimated for a given house conditioned on the contact rate likelihoods observed in houses with similar production characteristics using the following approach. A summary of the notation used for the multiple house estimation method is given in Supplementary Table S3. First, a multi-house contact rate likelihood was derived by multiplying the marginal contact rate likelihoods, estimated by summing up the likelihood across each candidate time of exposure for a given contact rate, from each house. Let \(l_{h} \left( {x|\beta , t_{intro} } \right)\) be the likelihood of observing the diagnostic testing data from house h. Let \(t_{1}\) be the earliest and \(t_{max}\) be the latest time of virus introduction evaluated for house h. The marginal likelihood for the contact rate, \(l_{h} \left( {x|\beta } \right)\), was determined by$$l_{h} \left( {x|\beta } \right) = \mathop \sum \limits_{{t_{intro} = t_{1} }}^{{t_{max} }} l_{h} \left( {x|\beta , t_{intro} } \right)$$Without loss of generality, suppose we are interested in estimating the time of virus introduction and contact rate from house 1, notated \(h_{1}\). Suppose that the set \(H\) of houses, \(h_{2} , h_{3} , \ldots , h_{n}\), have similar production systems to house \(h_{1}\). The multiple house contact rate likelihood, \(l_{H} \left( {x|\beta } \right)\), was determined by$$l_{H} \left( {x|\beta } \right) = \mathop \prod \limits_{{h = h_{2} }}^{{h_{n} }} l_{h} \left( {x|\beta } \right)$$The house 1 likelihood was combined with the multi-house contact rate likelihood through multiplication. Let \(l_{{h_{1} }}^{H} \left( {x|\beta , t_{intro} } \right)\) be the house 1 posterior likelihood conditioned on the contact rates from the houses in set H. This likelihood was determined by$$l_{{h_{1} }}^{H} \left( {x|\beta , t_{intro} } \right) = l_{{h_{1} }} \left( {x|\beta , t_{intro} } \right)l_{H} \left( {x|\beta } \right)$$Estimates for the contact rate and time of virus introduction were then estimated from the posterior \(p_{{h_{1} }}^{H} \left( {\beta , t_{intro} |x} \right)\), where$$p_{{h_{1} }}^{H} \left( {\beta , t_{intro} |x} \right) = \frac{{l_{{h_{1} }}^{H} \left( {x|\beta , t_{intro} } \right)\pi \left( {\beta , t_{intro} } \right)}}{{\mathop \sum \nolimits_{\beta } \mathop \sum \nolimits_{{t_{intro} }} l_{{h_{1} }}^{H} \left( {x|\beta , t_{intro} } \right)\pi \left( {\beta , t_{intro} } \right)}}$$The models were coded in R statistical software and C programming language and the analysis was performed using supercomputing resources of the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute30,31. Figures 1 and 2 were produced using the ‘ggplot2′ package in R30,32.Figure 1A contour plot of the posterior likelihood and plots of the marginal posterior likelihoods for the adequate contact rate and day of virus introduction estimated from the Kandiyohi 1 house 1 data.Full size imageFigure 2A contour plot of the posterior likelihood and plots of the marginal posterior likelihoods for the adequate contact rate and day of virus introduction estimated from the Kandiyohi 1 house 2 data.Full size imageMethod validationThe time of virus introduction and adequate contact rate were estimated from simulated data generated with known parameters in order to validate the estimation approach. Test results were simulated for two test schedule and two contact rate scenarios for six barns, each with a different time of exposure relative to the first test. The first test schedule scenario was a replicate of the Kandiyohi 2 test schedule. The second test schedule scenario consisted of an intensive testing schedule of three pooled rRT-PCR samples of 11 swabs each and 10 serum samples tested by AGID or ELISA taken on the same day every three days. The two contact rate scenarios consisted of a slow contact rate scenario, with the contact rate set to 1.0 contacts per bird per day, and a fast contact rate scenario, with the contact rate set to 4.5 contacts per bird per day. The times of virus introduction relative to the first test day for the six barns were 19 days prior, 6 days prior, 3 days prior, 1 day after, 2 days after, and 9 days after, respectively.The validation datasets were generated by first simulating the number of positive birds in a sample from a binomial distribution with the probability of sampling a positive bird equal to the infection prevalence or seroprevalence estimated from the LPAI transmission model. If a positive bird was sampled, the test result was simulated from a Bernoulli distribution with the probability of the sample testing positive equal to the test sensitivity. The validation datasets were formed by taking the average test results from 10,000 simulation iterations for each barn under each test schedule and contact rate scenario. The time of virus introduction and adequate contact rate were estimated from these datasets for both the single and multiple house approach.ResultsEstimated time of virus introduction and adequate contact rate from Kandiyohi 2 diagnostic testing dataThe mode, median, and 95% credibility interval (CI) estimated from diagnostic testing data from each of the five houses on Kandiyohi 2 are given in Table 2. Figures 1 and 2 display contour plots of the posterior likelihood and marginal posterior likelihood plots for the time of virus introduction and adequate contact rate for Kandiyohi 2 house 1 and Kandiyohi 2 house 2, respectively. The marginal posterior likelihood for the time of virus introduction was parabolic in shape for each house, meaning an informative mode and 95% CI could be estimated. On average, the 95% CI’s spanned 17 days.Table 2 Mode, median, and 95% CI for the date of virus introduction and adequate contact rate estimated from each house on Kandiyohi 2.Full size tableAn informative mode and 95% CI could not always be estimated for the adequate contact rate. In two of the houses on Kandiyohi 1, house 1 and house 2, the likelihood increased as the contact rate increased, as can be seen for house 1 in Fig. 1. For these two houses, only the lower CI bound is informative, with the upper CI bound entirely dependent on the upper bound of the prior distribution. In house 2, house 3, and house 4, on the other hand, the marginal posterior likelihood for the contact rate was parabolic in shape, allowing for more informative estimates.Method validation resultsThe mode, median, and 95% CI estimated from simulated diagnostic testing data based on the Kandiyohi 2 testing schedule for six houses with different dates of virus introduction and same adequate contact rate of 1.0 contact per day are given in Table 3. Estimates are given for the single and multiple house approach. The multiple house approach results given in the table consider the addition of one house and five houses. The results for the addition of one house are given as the average mode, median, and 95% CI estimated from all the possible house pairings. Validation results estimated from the three scenarios not represented in Table 3. ie. the results from simulated Kandiyohi 2 test data given a contact rate of 4.5 and simulated increased testing data given a contact rate of 1.0 contact per day and 4.5 contacts per day, are provided in the Supplementary Table S4, Supplementary Table S5, and Supplementary Table S6, respectively.Table 3 Validation results given barns were infected 19, 6, and 3 days prior to and 1, 2, and 9 days after the date of the first test, assumed to have been performed on October 20.Full size tableThe true estimates for the time of virus introduction and contact rate were contained by the 95% CI for each validation run under the single house estimation approach. Including the contact rate information from other houses in the multiple house approach generally both improved the accuracy and reduced uncertainty in the estimates. Similar issues with estimating an upper bound for the contact rate as encountered in the Kandiyohi 2 field data were present in the validation results. This can be observed in the results under the single barn approach in rows 1, 2, 3, and 6 in Table 3, where the upper bound for the contact rate is dependent on the bound of the prior distribution.As expected, more accurate estimates with narrower 95% CI bounds were observed in the results of the validation scenarios with increased testing. The estimation approach also performed better when the house was exposed to virus relatively close to or after the time of the first test as compared to houses exposed multiple days prior. While the estimates for the day of virus introduction were more accurate in the higher contact rate scenarios, performance did not necessarily improve for the contact rate estimates. An informative lower 95% CI bound could be estimated for the higher contact rate scenarios, but the upper bound, and oftentimes the mode, were dependent on the upper bound of the prior distribution.DiscussionMonitoring flocks with diagnostic testing is an intrinsic part of outbreak management strategies like controlled marketing in LPAI infected poultry flocks. Pinsent et al. (2014) developed a method to estimate the time of virus introduction and basic reproduction number from diagnostic testing data using a binomial likelihood and output from a deterministic disease transmission model4. Here, diagnostic testing data from five barns infected on a premises during the 2018 LPAI H5N2 outbreak in the U.S. state of Minnesota were used to estimate the time of virus introduction and adequate contact rate for each barn. The approach used built on the Pinsent et al. (2014) method in the following ways. First, output from a stochastic disease transmission model was used to estimate the likelihood as opposed to a deterministic model. Furthermore, pooled testing in addition to individual bird testing was incorporated into the method, and the method was applied to field data as opposed to simulated data only. Most notably, the method was extended to allow for parameter estimation from the combined likelihoods of multiple houses with the goal of reducing uncertainty in the estimates.The parameter estimates for the time of virus introduction and adequate contact rate can be used in a number of applications related to preventing widespread transmission of LPAI during an outbreak. The time of virus introduction estimates provide information on how the outbreak unfolded, which can help stakeholders evaluate the management of the outbreak and inform the response to future outbreaks. For example, the time between the estimated virus introduction time and date of detection could be used to assess the effectiveness of the active surveillance program used to monitor premises status. Most importantly, the estimates for the time of virus introduction can support epidemiologic investigations by helping stakeholders focus their efforts on a specific time window.The adequate contact rate can be an important input parameter in epidemiological models, including the stochastic disease transmission model used in this study in which the contact rate determines the within-flock rate of disease spread. The transmission model has also been used previously to inform surveillance design and risk assessments12,33,34. The adequate contact rate can vary according to factors like the virus strain, bird species and age, or housing type. The rate of disease spread can have a direct impact on the effectiveness of outbreak control measures. Diseases with slow rates of spread, for example, can take longer to be detected than ones with faster rates under the same active surveillance protocol34. Additionally, contact rate estimates can generate insight into the risk factors for fast and slow spread, which can be used to inform intervention strategies for specific houses and premises. During this LPAI outbreak in Minnesota, some industry veterinarians requested predictions for the time until no more infectious birds would be present in infected houses based on the latest diagnostic test results. These predictions can support logistics planning, namely when to schedule the houses to be sent to processing. Moreover, the accuracy of the predictions can be improved with contact rates estimated directly from the outbreak in progress.The only estimates for the contact rate for LPAI in turkeys identified in a literature review were from Comin et al. (2011) and Saenz et al. (2012)3,18. Furthermore, only in Comin et al. (2011) was the transmission parameter estimated from field data, where the spread dynamics can differ from those of the laboratory in transmission experiments3. As a result, there is substantial uncertainty in the turkey LPAI contact rate, which increases uncertainty in the appropriate contact rate value or distribution to use in proactive risk assessment, where it can be advantageous to model outbreak conditions with greater generality. Thus, the contact rates estimated from the turkeys flocks infected with LPAI in the field in Minnesota provide critical information on this parameter.The estimation approach performed well for estimating the time of virus introduction, as an informative mode, upper 95% CI bound, and lower 95% CI bound could be estimated for each house on Kandiyohi 2 as well as for each of the validation simulation runs. While informative estimates could be derived for the contact rate for many houses and validation runs, for others the estimates for the mode and upper 95% CI bound were uninformative due to being dependent on the upper bound of the prior distribution. An example of the latter can be observed in the plot of the marginal posterior likelihood for the contact rate estimated from the Kandiyohi 1 house 1 diagnostic testing data given in Fig. 1. The shape of the marginal posterior is suggestive of practical non-identifiability, which refers to the inability to derive informative estimates from the model due to limited or uncertainty in the data35.The validation results suggest a few strategies that can improve contact rate identifiability. First of all, greater uncertainty was observed in the validation results when the flock was close to 100% seroconverted by the time of the first test. When the flock is close to 100% seroconversion, there is little change in the test results; they quickly fall into a pattern of all negative rRT-PCR results and all seropositive serum samples. This introduces uncertainty into the contact rate estimates in that the pattern of change observed in the test results provides information on the rate of spread. For example, suppose 10 serum samples were collected five days apart. A result of zero seropositive samples followed by 10 seropositive samples would suggest faster disease spread than a result of zero seropositive samples followed by 3 seropositive samples. An example of greater uncertainty in the contact rate due to testing starting close to or after the flock is 100% seroconverted can be observed in the estimates for the validation house assumed to be exposed 19 days prior to the first test given in the first row of Table 3. All this suggests that early detection of LPAI virus in a house is important for obtaining identifiable contact rate estimates.A second strategy that can improve contact rate estimation is to increase the amount of testing done during the outbreak. An example of improved contact rate estimates due to increased testing can be observed in the validation results for the house assumed to be exposed six days prior to the first day of testing given in Table 3 compared to the results given in Supplementary Table S4. The third strategy is to use the multiple house estimation method, which improved the contact rate estimates for the validation houses in rows 1, 2, 3, and 6 in Table 3, for example. While this strategy is far easier and less costly to implement than increasing active surveillance for early detection or increasing the amount of testing performed while monitoring flock status, it may not always be appropriate due to the houses having differing production characteristics. Detecting virus in the house well before 100% seroconversion, increasing the amount of testing performed for monitoring infected flocks, and using the multiple house estimation method all improve the quality of information on the dynamics of virus spread within the infected houses. This not only can refine the estimates for the contact rate, but also can reduce uncertainty and improve the accuracy of estimates for the time of virus introduction.The objective in this study of estimating parameters from diagnostic testing data has the benefit of a defined likelihood function that can link output from the stochastic simulation to the observed data, i.e. the binomial likelihood function. The time of virus introduction and adequate contact rate could alternatively be estimated using a likelihood-free approach such as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC)36, a method growing in popularity and used by Guinat et al. (2018), for example, to estimate the time of virus introduction in pig herds infected with African swine fever7.An advantage of the ABC approach as compared to the likelihood approach used in this analysis is that the parameter space can be sampled using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), allowing for more efficient exploration of the parameter space. This advantage would be even more pronounced as the number of parameters to be estimated increases, since the number of unique parameter combinations would increase exponentially in the grid-based method used in the likelihood approach. However, convergence of the MCMC chains can be difficult to achieve. The main advantage of the likelihood parameter estimation approach is the ability to easily combine the likelihoods from multiple houses and estimate a combined contact rate distribution that can then be used to estimate the time of virus introduction for a given house. It was demonstrated in the validation results that the multiple house estimation method can reduce uncertainty in and improve the accuracy of the contact rate and time of virus introduction estimates. Joint estimation of the contact rate for multiple houses would be challenging under the ABC approach in that the simulated output would have to match or be close to the observed test results for multiple houses, leading to low acceptance rates. Both approaches are computationally intensive and their implementation is only feasible due to advances in and wider availability of supercomputing resources.Estimating parameters from diagnostic testing data has utility for LPAI in poultry due to established tests that can detect virus and antibodies with high sensitivity. The estimation approach detailed in this article may be less applicable to those viruses whose diagnostic tests have low sensitivity as this would introduce greater uncertainty into the observed test results and estimated parameters. Since LPAI virus infections are often associated with low mortality, diagnostic testing is an especially important indicator for the progression of the virus through meat turkey and broiler flocks. Egg laying flocks can have an additional indicator in the form of decreased egg production. Egg production data could be combined with diagnostic testing data using an approach such as ABC to estimate the time of virus introduction or contact rate. For viruses such as highly pathogenic avian influenza or African swine fever that cause very high mortality in the host population, an approach that relies on the mortality data has the greatest utility. Examples of approaches for high mortality include Bos et al. and Guinat et al.5,7.Overall, our findings demonstrate a valid approach for estimating disease transmission parameters that has been used to support epidemiological investigations of LPAI outbreaks in Missouri, North and South Carolina, and the outbreak in Minnesota10,37. This approach may also be deployable in response to outbreaks caused by high consequence viruses in other species and geographical locations.

Among respiratory viruses, emerging and well-known coronaviruses and influenza viruses cause seasonal epidemics and pandemics and rank as very important pathogens. The clinical signs of viral respiratory infections range from asymptomatic forms to life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, associated with a high mortality rate). Another reported cause of mortality is multiple organ dysfunction. The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)) is a serious public health problem. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces to a clinical signature distinct from that associated with other types of pneumonia, and SARS-CoV-2 differs from influenza viruses with regard to target cells and replicative properties. The morbidity and mortality rates are higher for COVID-19 than for seasonal influenza.When considering community-acquired viral pneumonia caused by different pathogens, it is essential to compare the respective host immune signatures. This comparison can highlight conserved or specific immune pathways involved in the pathogenesis. In a recent issue of Immunity, Zhu et al. described the dynamic immune landscape in patients with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza A virus (IAV) infections.1 Using single-cell RNA sequencing, the researchers compared transcriptomic changes during the course of infection in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). This approach enabled the researchers to report that the gene expression pattern in patients with COVID-19 differs from that in IAV-infected patients.An average of 2000 unique transcriptomes for each patient and at each time point were generated. Unsupervised clustering of these transcriptomes identified 15 discrete cell populations. None of the cell populations analyzed presented signs of viral genetic material. Among all clusters, the proportion of some B cell subsets (plasma and cycling plasma cells) was greater in all patients with viral infection than in healthy controls, suggesting an active mechanism of producing protective antibodies (as exemplified by the upregulation of signature genes such as PRDM1 and IRF4 in the B cells). This indicates that on admission, patients have already started to mount a virus-specific immune response. Compared to IAV-infected patients, the counts of XCL1+ NK cells and CD8+ T cells were significantly increased in patients with COVID-19. Conversely, IAV-infected patients had an increased count of activated CD4+ T cells. Regarding the molecular components of the immune response, the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF) and cytokine receptors (IL6R, IL2RA, and IL7R) was higher in multiple cell types in patients with COVID-19 than in IAV-infected patients. Of note, many receptors involved in the activation of cytokines were more strongly expressed in activated CD4+ T cells, indicating a particular role of this subset in the cytokine-driven inflammatory response reported in COVID-19 patients. The expression levels of hallmark genes in the type I IFN response (STAT1, IRF3, and IFNAR1) were also increased in the circulating immune cells of patients with COVID-19. This is of interest with regard to the controversial role of type I IFNs in the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.2 Conversely, IAV-infected patients had enhanced expression of transcription factors (such as STAT3, REL, and RUNX3) involved in the regulation of the inflammatory immune response when compared with the expression in patients with COVID-19. Taken as a whole, Zhu et al.’s results suggest that patients with COVID-19 and patients with influenza have both common and specific systemic immune traits (Fig. 1). Interestingly, a recent report also compared the immune responses in patients with COVID-19 and those with IAV infections.3 Lee et al. confirmed the intense type I IFN response in patients with severe COVID-19, reinforcing the hypothesis of a pivotal role played by type I IFN in exacerbating cytokine-mediated inflammatory responses in patients with severe COVID-19.Fig. 1Local and systemic responses during COVID-19 and influenza infections. Conserved and specific immune pathways (cell subsets, transcription factors and cytokines) potentially involved in the pathogenesis were identified at the systemic level. Further work is needed to analyze specific and common immune traits in the lungs during COVID-19 and influenza infectionsFull size imageAlthough these data provide important insights and reveal differences in the immune landscapes in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and those infected with influenza viruses, they also raise new questions. The small number of patients in each group (5 and 8 patients with COVID-19 in Zhu et al.’s and Lee et al.’s studies, respectively) might accentuate individual differences. Single-cell transcriptomics has revealed the heterogeneity of peripheral immune activation in patients with COVID-19.4 To gain a detailed, robust view of the systemic immune responses, these data need to be confirmed in future prospective cohorts with larger patient groups. Since neutrophil dysfunction has emerged as a potential key event in COVID-19 pathogenesis,5 comparative analyses using total circulating leukocytes instead of PBMCs should be encouraged. Advanced integration of the transcriptomic data with the clinical presentation and management (e.g., the nature of supportive care and treatments) would also be useful. Longitudinal analyses of well-characterized clinical cohorts (in terms of age and comorbidities) will be essential. Complementary high-throughput technologies (such as Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing, metabolomics, and proteomics) might also be very informative.6 Exploring the mechanisms that underlie the transition from respiratory virus-related pneumonia to ARDS and multiple organ dysfunction is critical for furthering our understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and flu. Therefore, studies of patients with various clinical courses and outcomes will be highly valuable. Since the inflammatory response in viral infection-induced ARDS (including COVID-19-driven ARDS) is compartmentalized within the lung,7,8 a comparative analysis of the immune landscape in the lung will be of great interest. It is noteworthy that single-cell omics of the upper respiratory tract9 and bronchoalveolar lavages10 has already revealed interesting clues. Finally, although scientists are usually conditioned to identify differences and to generate original data, highlighting common immune traits in distinct diseases might also be useful for advancing our understanding of the pathogenesis and developing therapeutic strategies. Moreover, immunologists should be encouraged to create a comprehensive and dynamic picture of the immune response during acute viral respiratory infections. This type of approach might yield valuable predictive markers of disease severity and outcomes and might pave the way for generic or more tailored treatment options.

In addition, vaccine responses in mice are often poorly predictive of responses to those same vaccines in humans. Here we use human tonsils, readily available lymphoid organs, to develop a functional organotypic system that recapitulates key germinal center features in vitro, including the production of antigen-specific antibodies, somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation, plasmablast differentiation and class-switch recombination. We use this system to define the essential cellular components necessary to produce an influenza vaccine response. We also show that it can be used to evaluate humoral immune responses to two priming antigens, rabies vaccine and an adenovirus-based severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccine, and to assess the effects of different adjuvants. This system should prove useful for studying critical mechanisms underlying adaptive immunity in much greater depth than previously possible and to rapidly test vaccine candidates and adjuvants in an entirely human system.

The B cells that are responsible for forming a neutralizing antibody response develop within germinal centers (GCs) and extrafollicular regions in lymphoid organs8,9,10,11. Upon antigen presentation by antigen-presenting cells (APCs)12,13,14,15, T follicular helper (TFH) cells, and a variety of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells interact and deliver signals to GC B cells for survival, proliferation, antibody affinity maturation, class-switch recombination and differentiation16,17. Almost all of these interactions have been elucidated through in vivo studies of inbred mice. While these have produced a wealth of important information8,18,19,20, the lack of a system that replicates the essential features of human adaptive immunity, such as affinity maturation and class switching, and the effects of adjuvants, leaves many mechanistic aspects inaccessible. This is especially important for vaccine testing since many candidates that worked in animal models ultimately fail in human trials21,22,23,24, suggesting that genetic and environmental differences among species are important considerations in vaccine development.Many in vitro systems rely on isolation of small chunks or slices of a tissue sample to prepare explant cultures25,26,27,28,29,30,31. Explant methods, although useful for studying individual aspects of infection and immunity30,32,33,34, typically do not maintain cell composition for very long (3–4 d), nor do they capture all of the features of an adaptive immune response. Although bioreactor, chip-based and other specialized in vitro differentiation systems show promise, they too have not been able to replicate the complexities of adaptive immunity. We decided to take advantage of the widespread availability of human tonsils, lymphoid organs that are easily procured from tonsillectomy surgeries as discarded tissue, to develop an accessible system that replicates an antigen-specific adaptive immune response to a vaccine and supports key aspects of adaptive immunity.ResultsPreparation of immune organoids from tonsils and other lymphoid tissuesOver 20 years ago, Owen and Jenkinson demonstrated that dissociated murine thymic cells could reassociate in culture and recapitulate major aspects of T cell selection35,36. We applied a similar approach to develop human tonsil cultures with dissociated cells that reaggregate in culture (Fig. 1a; see Supplementary Table 1 for tissue donor characteristics). For organoid preparation, frozen single-cell suspensions from tonsil tissues were thawed and plated at high density into the wells of permeable membrane plates (commonly known as Transwells) along with the antigen of interest. After several days in culture, reaggregated regions of clustered cells were visible (Fig. 1a). We assessed the cell composition of the reaggregated cultures after 7 d in the presence or absence of antigen and our optimized culture conditions (Methods) sustained appropriate tonsil cell composition (Fig. 1b). We used influenza vaccines and viruses as model antigens since much is already known about the features of the human influenza response in vivo. Upon stimulation with live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), there were notable increases in B cell differentiation and a more structured culture morphology developed, suggesting additional activity in response to this immunogen.Fig. 1: Adaptive immune responses in tonsil organoids.a, Workflow for tissue disruption and culture preparation with representative stereoscope images from day-5 unstimulated or LAIV-stimulated replicate cultures.

A/Cal, A/California H1N1 virus.Full size imageWe measured the capacity of organoid cultures to support B cell maturation and function upon LAIV stimulation (see Extended Data Fig. 1a for representative staining) and found that after 7 d, plasmablast frequencies were significantly increased compared to unstimulated controls (Fig. 1c; n = 15; P = 0.0002). Thirteen of the fifteen donors tested, ranging in age from 2–14 years, produced influenza-specific IgG antibodies in only the LAIV-stimulated samples (P < 0.0001). Of the two exceptions, one donor had a high response without stimulation and the other was a true nonresponder. The latter donor (a 3-year-old) may have been naive for influenza infection and had no reported influenza vaccination. The production of specific antibody was not a generic effect of stimulation, as total (that is, antigen agnostic) IgG was reduced by LAIV (Fig. 1d). We also performed enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot (ELISpot) analysis on day-7 cultures from five donors and found influenza-specific antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) ranging from 0.1–1.5% of total B cells (Fig. 1e; representative ELISpot data in Extended Data Fig. 1b). Almost no influenza-specific ASCs were identified in unstimulated tonsil cultures (<0.02% of total B cells in all donors). The Transwell organoid culture strategy was superior to flat-bottom tissue culture plates of similar surface area for growing tonsil mononuclear cells (Extended Data Fig. 1c).We also tested whether our organoid culture strategy could support human lung-draining lymph node and spleen samples (Fig. 1f). These organoids responded to both LAIV and wild-type A/California H1N1 influenza virus by producing influenza-specific antibodies at levels substantially above those of control cultures and equivalent to tonsil organoids.Longitudinal analysis of tonsil cultures in response to LAIVGiven the evidence of B cell maturation and antibody secretion in organoid cultures stimulated with LAIV, we performed longitudinal analyses to observe the differentiation process over time. CD38 and CD27 expression patterns on B cells from LAIV-stimulated cultures clearly evolved (Fig. 2a), indicating an early transition to a pre-GC phenotype (CD38+CD27−), and in two of three donors, this was followed by plasmablast differentiation (Fig. 2b). The frequency of plasmablasts typically correlated with the total amount of specific antibodies produced (Extended Data Fig. 1d). Changes in T cell phenotypes were also observed, including recovery of TFH (CXCR5+CD4+) cells during culture (in both unstimulated and LAIV-stimulated organoids), as well as transient CD4+ and CD8+ T cell activation at day 7 in LAIV-stimulated cultures (Fig. 2c). Organoids prepared from only one of the over 50 donors tested (IMD012) did not produce influenza-specific antibodies (Fig. 2d). With four additional donors, we confirmed that influenza-specific antibodies are produced with the expected kinetics (between days 5 and 10). We also gauged the ability of these cultures to produce neutralizing antibodies; in the two strains tested (of the four LAIV strains), vaccine-stimulated culture supernatants showed neutralizing capabilities, while unstimulated controls did not (Fig. 2e).Fig. 2: Longitudinal tracking of immune organoids reveals cellular and functional changes consistent with an adaptive response.a, Representative flow cytometry staining of B cell differentiation phenotypes in unstimulated and LAIV-stimulated cultures.

Donor ages (in years) are shown in parentheses after donor IDs.Full size imageWe also assessed the T cell response in HLA-A2+ donors using class I tetramers targeting the immunodominant influenza M1 specificity (Fig. 2f). Three of the four donors tested showed a two- to ten-fold expansion of M1-specific CD8+ T cells by day 7 after stimulation with LAIV. The one nonresponder had fewer M1-specific CD8+ T cells in their starting repertoire compared to the other donors, which may explain their poor CD8+ T cell response.Spatial organization of tonsil organoidsDuring an adaptive immune response, peripheral lymphoid organs like the tonsils, lymph nodes and spleen develop GCs. B cells congregate in the GC area, whereas T cells are largely in outlying areas8,19. In the organoid cultures, we found GC-like structures with distinct B cell- and T cell-rich aggregates in both LAIV-stimulated and unstimulated cultures, starting around 48 h after culture initiation. These progressed to well-defined clusters by days 4–7, particularly in LAIV-treated cultures (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 2). We analyzed the embedded, frozen sections of three donors by fluorescent confocal microscopy and found evidence of light and dark zone organization, as detected by separation of CD83 and CXCR4 staining B cells, respectively, which are characteristic of GCs (Fig. 3a; additional representative images are available in Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3a).Fig. 3: Diversity and maturation of the influenza response.a, Confocal microscopy images of a day-4 LAIV-stimulated organoid culture and B cell areas with light zone (LZ) and dark zone (DZ) organization. b, Single-cell RNA-seq of B cells from day-0 tonsil cells and organoid cultures from days 5 and 9 from one donor.

High-affinity B cells specific for HA from day-0 (black points) and day-7 LAIV-stimulated organoid cultures (green, blue and red points representing IgM, IgA and IgG isotypes, respectively) are shown. Clonal families are represented by open shading. e, Organoid cultures pre-depleted of high-affinity A/California HA+ B cells and non-naive B cells produce new HA+ B cells. Effective depletion on day 0 of HA+ B cells and non-naive populations was confirmed by post-sort analysis, and new HA+ B cells were detectable on day 10. Data shown are representative plots from one of n = 4 donors. f, Influenza-specific antibodies were detected in depleted organoid cultures from three of n = 4 donors tested. Donor ages (in years) are shown in parentheses after donor IDs.Full size imageWe also performed a single-cell RNA-seq analysis along with DNA-barcoded antibodies using the BD Rhapsody platform to characterize the expression profiles of GC-phenotype B cells in organoid cultures. Dimensionality reduction (uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP)) was used to analyze GC B cells across different time points (Fig. 3b). Overall, GC B cells (CD38+CD27+) from the different days and time points clustered together, showing that their expression profiles were similar. The top overexpressed genes in GC B cells (compared to naive B cells) at day 5 of LAIV-stimulated cultures were related to antibody secretion (immunoglobulin heavy chains, light chains and J chain) and key B cell differentiation, proliferation and B cell receptor (BCR) signaling genes (XBP1, POU2AF1, S100A10 and PCNA). These were also the top differentially expressed genes between direct ex vivo GC and naive B cells. These data show that the cultures can functionally respond to antigen-specific stimulation, that light and dark zone phenotype B cells separate into distinct areas (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 3a) and that B cells with a GC phenotype have similar transcriptional profiles on day 0 and day 5 after culture (Fig. 3b), which collectively support the conclusion that these cultures can be considered organoids.Diversity and maturation of hemagglutinin-specific B cellsWe next examined whether activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), which is required for both somatic hypermutation and class switching, was expressed in these cultures. AID protein levels (Fig. 3c; see representative staining in Extended Data Fig. 3b) were significantly increased in pre-GC and GC B cells in 4-day-old organoid cultures (prevalence shown in Fig. 3c). We also single-cell sequenced BCRs from high-affinity A/California 2009 H1N1 hemagglutinin (HA)-specific plasmablasts (and other activated B cells) using a HA trimer construct37 on day-0 and day-7 LAIV-stimulated cultures to evaluate affinity maturation and isotype switching. As previously reported in peripheral blood plasmablasts of influenza-vaccinated volunteers38, immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable gene cluster (IGHV) 3 and IGHV4 dominated the response (Fig. 3d; see Extended Data Fig. 4 for complete dataset). HA-specific BCRs from LAIV-stimulated organoids were quite diverse in both gene usage and isotype; numerous oligoclonal expansions were seen at day 7, but these clones were distinct from those detected in day-0 high-affinity HA+ B cells. Clonally related BCR families were also found in LAIV-stimulated organoids, and in one of two donors, we found clonal families with single amino acid changes, showing diversification within HA-specific lineages. Using bulk BCR sequencing of total non-naive B cells, we found lineages that began as the IgM isotype and class switched during organoid culture (mostly to IgG1 and IgA1), usually with additional mutations, by day 7 (Extended Data Fig. 5).Affinity maturation in tonsil organoidsAffinity maturation is another key function of GCs. To evaluate this, we performed depletion experiments using FACS to eliminate preexisting high-affinity HA+ B cells and also any non-naive B cells from the tonsil cell pool. Cultures were then prepared from the depleted cells, stimulated with LAIV, and stained again on day 10 to assess the development of new high-affinity HA+ B cells (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 6). In three of four donors tested, HA+ B cells reappeared in depleted cultures and influenza-specific secreted antibodies were detectable (Fig. 3f), demonstrating that affinity maturation can be directly observed in this system.Next, we used IgH sequencing to analyze the BCR repertoire in naive versus affinity matured B cells in response to LAIV stimulation. Here, we prepared cultures where naive, HA− B cells were the only B cell source (Fig. 4a and Methods). We used day-0 HA+ B cells as the reference for high-affinity BCRs and to infer HA specificity. Organoid cultures were harvested on day 7 for bulk BCR repertoire sequencing (Fig. 4a). We compared the repertoires of these cultures to both the in vivo high-affinity HA+ B cells from day-0 tonsil cells that were depleted by FACS and the HA− naive B cells that went into culture preparations. Of the six donors tested, five secreted antibodies specific for vaccine components and four had detectable antibodies specific for the A/California 2009 H1N1 HA protein on day 7 after stimulation (Fig. 4b), showing that we can derive HA-specific antibodies from naive B cells.Fig. 4: Somatic hypermutation and antigen-directed affinity maturation are supported in tonsil organoids.a, BCR repertoire analysis workflow on cultures prepared from tonsil cells depleted of high-affinity HA+ and total non-naive B cells (n = 6 donors). b, Influenza vaccine-specific and A/California 2009 H1N1 HA-specific antibodies after 7 d in unstimulated and LAIV-stimulated cultures. c, Somatic hypermutation as measured by the number of nucleotide mutations from the germline heavy-chain BCR sequences. Data are mean ± s.e.m. and significance was calculated with two-sided Welch t-tests. d, Clone size (as measured by the number of RNA molecules per lineage) and diversity (as measured by the number of unique RNA molecules per lineage) in A/California 2009 H1N1 HA+ B cell lineages compared to non-A/California HA+ lineages were measured in n = 6 donors. Specificity for A/California HA was inferred from the pool of known day-0 HA+ BCRs. Box plots show median values with hinges representing the first and third quartiles and whiskers representing the highest and lowest value that is within 1.5 times the interquartile range of the hinges. Each overlaid point represents an individual lineage. Significance values shown were calculated using two-sided Welch t-tests. Donor ages (in years) are shown in parentheses after donor IDs. e, Development of HA specificity in a BCR lineage from one donor. The size of the node represents the number of RNA molecules detected, the distance between nodes is proportional to the edit distance (nucleotide) between them, and the color reflects edit distance (amino acid) to the nearest known A/California HA-specific sequence, with light blue representing an exact match. The root sequence (56), major node (86) and a subset of the major node with IgG class switch (85) are highlighted.Full size imageSomatic hypermutation was significantly increased in day-7 LAIV-stimulated cultures compared to unstimulated control cultures and was particularly enhanced where A/California 2009 H1N1 HA antibodies were detected (IMD006, 013, 014 and 102; Fig. 4c). We also followed the development of BCR sequences likely (within one amino acid) to be specific for influenza strain A/California H1N1. In two of the six donors tested (IMD006 and IMD014), the B cell clones with inferred HA specificity for this strain were also larger than those without known HA specificity and this was dependent on vaccine stimulation (Fig. 4d). In these same donors, the average diversity was also increased, with more unique molecules per clonal lineage in HA-specific B cells from LAIV-stimulated cultures (Fig. 4d). We found other expanded and diverse lineages only in the vaccine-stimulated cultures, likely responding to other antigens or strains. We also found direct evidence for BCR sequence evolution to increased HA affinity (Fig. 4e). Here a root sequence with four nucleotide mutations from the germline heavy-chain sequence acquired an additional ten mutations to achieve an exact amino acid match to a known high-affinity HA specificity. Taken together, these data confirm that antigen-driven somatic hypermutation, affinity maturation and class switching are supported in tonsil organoid cultures.Contributions of individual cell types to influenza responsesA major advantage of in vitro systems is the ability to define the essential components. Therefore, we depleted APC, T cell and B cell subsets and compared plasmablast differentiation (Fig. 5a,c) and antigen-specific antibody secretion (Fig. 5b,d) to wild-type organoids. Despite their low starting frequency (0.1–0.5% of live), depleting myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) populations completely abrogated plasmablast differentiation (Fig. 5a) and depleting pDCs alone was sufficient to dramatically reduce the antibody response to LAIV (Fig. 5b). We were able to rescue the effect of pDC loss by adding type I interferon (IFN), showing that type I IFN production is the main pDC function (Extended Data Fig. 7a).Fig. 5: Depletion studies reveal cell types required for plasmablast differentiation, specific antibody secretion and antibody affinity in organoid cultures.a,b, Effect of cell subset depletion on (a) plasmablast differentiation and (b) specific antibody secretion. Fold change in plasmablast frequency is relative to sorted cells reconstituted with the depleted cell type. Sort depletion experiments were performed on cells from n = 6 (naive B cells and non-naive B cells), n = 2 (total B cells and pDCs) or n = 3 (myeloid cells + pDCs, regulatory T (Treg) cells, memory B cells and plasmablasts) donors. c,d, Effect of CD4+ depletion on (c) plasmablast differentiation and (d) antibody production after 7 d in organoid culture (n = 15 donors). Antibodies against influenza were not detected in unstimulated controls. Paired, two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to determine the significance values. e, Dependence on CD4+ cells for influenza-specific antibody secretion was associated with age. Intact or CD4+ depleted, LAIV-stimulated cultures were stratified into ages 5 years and under (red) or older than 5 (cyan). Box plots show the median values with hinges representing the first and third quartiles and whiskers representing the highest and lowest value that is within 1.5 times the interquartile range of the hinges. Unpaired, two-sided Mann–Whitney U tests were used to calculate significance. f, Biolayer interferometry binding data from intact or CD4+-depleted cultures. Dissociation rates as measured by kd (1/s) are shown for four donors and detailed binding traces from one representative donor. Data were collected from antibodies binding full-length A/California 2009 H1N1 HA or head domain only. Stem-specific antibodies were detected in two donors but only under CD4-containing conditions. Colors are matched to donor data shown in c and d. g, Minimal cell requirements to support an influenza B cell response. Individual cell types were sorted and then recombined as shown to test for plasmablast differentiation and antibody secretion after 7 d of stimulation with LAIV (n = 7 donors). h, Contribution of naive versus memory CD4+ T cells in B cell differentiation and influenza-specific antibody secretion under minimal cellular conditions. Naive B cells, APCs and CD45− cells were sorted and combined with equal numbers of either naive (CD45RA+CD27+) or memory (all non-naive) CD4+ T cells for 10 d in the presence of LAIV (n = 5 donors).Full size imageAs expected, depleting CD4+ cells (Extended Data Fig. 7b) significantly reduced plasmablast differentiation, although some influenza-specific antibodies were still detectable (Fig. 5c,d). We analyzed the effect of donor age and found that CD4+ T cell-depleted organoids from younger children were almost entirely unable to secrete influenza-specific antibody (Fig. 5e), in contrast to older donors who could make antibody responses. We also characterized the affinities of antibodies against A/California/07/2009 H1N1 HA in CD4+-depleted cultures. The dissociation rates for antibodies raised in the absence of CD4+ cells were four- to ten-fold higher than wild-type controls (Fig. 5f and Extended Data Fig. 7c), even when the quantity of specific antibody was comparable between intact and CD4+-depleted cultures. Thus, CD4+ T cells are important for both the magnitude and affinity of the antibody response.We determined that three to four cell types were minimally required to consistently achieve detectable plasmablast differentiation and naive antibody responses against LAIV: naive B cells, APCs, CD4+ T cells and, in some donors, a mixed population of CD45− stromal cells (Fig. 5g). Notably, naive CD4+ T cells were either as good or better than memory CD4+ T cells in their ability to help B cells differentiate into plasmablasts and stimulate influenza-specific antibodies (Fig. 5h).Response to other antigens and the effect of adjuvantsWe next investigated whether tonsil organoids could also respond to non-influenza memory antigens. We stimulated tonsil organoids with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which is recommended to be administered at 12 months, and assessed plasmablast formation and antigen-specific IgG responses. These cultures had significantly increased plasmablasts compared to controls (Fig. 6a), and six of the seven donors made measles-specific IgG, while the mumps and rubella responses were weaker and only detected in three of the older children tested (Fig. 6b).Fig. 6: Ability to respond to non-influenza antigens and immunomodulation with adjuvants.a,b, Plasmablast differentiation in response to MMR vaccine stimulation in tonsil organoid cultures (a) and their corresponding MMR-specific IgG production (b). Organoid cultures from seven donors were harvested on day 11 for flow cytometry analysis and antibody secretion. Significance values were calculated using paired, two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Donor ages are shown in parentheses. c, PE-specific B cells were detected at low levels in unstimulated cultures (0.05% of total B cells) and were increased with PE stimulation but not with an irrelevant antigen (n = 3 donors; day 11 after stimulation). d, PE-specific B cell frequencies were enhanced by stimulation in the presence of alum (n = 4 donors; day 10 after stimulation). Representative flow cytometry plots are shown from one donor. Individual points are shown for each donor. Treatment groups were tested with paired, two-sided t-tests to determine significance values. e, Tonsil organoid responses to rabies vaccine, as indicated by pre-GC, GC and plasmablast B cell phenotypes and antigen-specific IgM after 14 d of culture. NP, nucleoprotein. P values between treatment groups were determined with paired, two-sided t-tests (n = 10 donors). f, Lung-draining lymph nodes and spleen organoids were stimulated for 14 d with rabies vaccine. g, Tonsil organoids were stimulated with vaccine candidates for SARS-CoV-2 (n = 12 donors). Ad5 vectors containing either spike protein (S), spike and nucleocapsid protein (SN) or the S1 spike subunit with nucleocapsid (S1N) were used for stimulation, and responses were measured after 14 d in culture. Box plots show the median values with hinges representing the first and third quartiles and whiskers representing the highest and lowest value that is within 1.5 times the interquartile range of the hinges. Culture supernatants were collected and tested for antigen-specific IgM, IgG and IgA. One donor that was positive for multiple proteins is shown. An irrelevant adenoviral vector with norovirus VP1 was used as a control. Paired, two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to calculate P values shown (not adjusted for multiple comparisons).Full size imageTo determine whether tonsil organoids could serve as a platform for priming antigen-specific adaptive responses, we first stimulated cells with naive antigen phycoerythrin (PE), with and without adjuvants. Here we saw a substantial (tenfold) increase in PE+ B cells in PE-stimulated cultures compared to unstimulated or irrelevant antigen-stimulated cultures (Fig. 6c). The frequency of PE+ B cells could also be enhanced by alum hydrogel but not imiquimod (Fig. 6d), indicating that at least some naive responses can be elicited and modulated by appropriate adjuvants. We next tested the ability of tonsils, lung-draining lymph nodes and spleen cultures to respond to the T cell-dependent rabies vaccine. The donors had not previously received this vaccine. Tonsil B cells were more differentiated in vaccine-stimulated cultures after 14 d in organoid culture and four of ten donors had detectable increases in rabies nucleoprotein-specific IgM (Fig. 6e). Lung-draining lymph node and spleen organoids also showed modest rabies-specific antibody production, with some specific IgM but not IgG production, consistent with a priming response39 (Fig. 6f).Finally, we investigated the ability of tonsil organoids to respond to a series of vaccine candidates developed in response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). These vaccine candidates use a replication-deficient type 5 adenovirus (Ad5) that encodes either the full-length viral spike protein, spike and nucleocapsid protein or the S1 spike subunit with nucleocapsid in the Ad5 E1 region. All tonsil tissue samples were collected before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and thus naive to these antigens. On day 14 after stimulation, we observed plasmablast differentiation in a subset of donors and significant CD8 T cell activation compared to unstimulated controls (Fig. 6g). Using a protein microarray to detect antibody specificities against SARS-CoV-2, specific IgG and IgA antibodies were present for some spike and nucleocapsid proteins in a few donors. One particularly robust responder, IMD163, is shown in Fig. 6g (data from all donors are available in Extended Data Fig. 8). This shows that immune organoid cultures can be used to analyze and compare vaccine candidates to new and previously encountered antigens.DiscussionAlthough GCs have been studied extensively in mice, to our knowledge this is the first report of an in vitro system supporting antigen-specific somatic hypermutation, affinity maturation and class switching of human B cells. Tonsils are a readily accessible and underutilized source of human immune tissue and contain all the cell types involved in adaptive immunity, including those largely absent from peripheral blood. We used tonsil organoids to characterize features of the human influenza response and validated and extended findings from previous human and murine studies. We show that the B cell response to influenza vaccine is diverse and can develop from the naive repertoire. We found that preexisting HA-specific B cells had 5–10 heavy-chain nucleotide mutations (2–4% mutation rate), and LAIV-stimulated organoids prepared with naive-only B cells had 3–9 mutations, which was adequate to make specific antibodies (Fig. 4). These rates are in line with the average 5% mutation rate measured in influenza-vaccinated adults40.Human immune responses are incredibly variable, as seen in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and a major goal of vaccine development is to confer protective immunity as broadly as possible. Another useful feature of the organoid system is its ability to assess immune response variability. We found that while the organoids from most donors respond to LAIV, the magnitude and kinetics of those responses vary widely. In a test of 15 donors, organoids prepared from one donor did not respond to LAIV within 7 d (Fig. 1). This individual was young and not vaccinated against influenza, suggesting that they could be naive to influenza, and organoids prepared from their cells might require more time to mount a response. In our longitudinal analyses (Fig. 2), we identified a nonresponder who was treated with daily inhaled corticosteroids, demonstrating the sensitivity of the system to immunosuppressive agents. Using SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates, we found even more variability, with some individuals unable to make B cell and/or T cell responses. This further reinforces the need for a system like this to assess broad immunogenicity before clinical studies.Using depletion studies, we established the functional relevance of individual immune cell types to the influenza response. pDCs were crucial to the antibody response, although they could be replaced by exogenous type I IFN. These data are consistent with a previous study that found that pDCs induce human blood B cell differentiation through type I IFN41 but contrast with a murine influenza challenge study that showed pDCs were dispensable to the response42, highlighting a difference between murine and human systems. We also identified a role for preexisting plasmablasts/plasma cells in regulating B cell differentiation (Fig. 5a,b). When plasmablasts were depleted at the initiation of the culture, influenza-specific antibody production was increased compared to wild-type controls. Secondary lymphoid tissues are competitive niches for plasma cell survival outside of the bone marrow43, so depletion of preexisting plasma cells may promote antigen-specific plasmablast survival. We demonstrated that T cell help plays an age-dependent role in the magnitude of the influenza-specific antibody response and showed that CD4+ T cells play an additional role in affinity maturation and B cell selection (Fig. 5). Memory CD4+ T cells from older children better sustained a naive B cell response, suggesting that T cell help is refined by in vivo exposure. These findings are in line with an earlier mouse study showing that memory T cells can contribute to GC responses even though naive B cells typically did not in their system44. Stem-specific antibodies were also only detectable when CD4+ T cells were present, suggesting that manipulating T cell help is a reasonable strategy to consider for future vaccine design.Previous efforts to create artificial human lymphoid tissues depended on specialized bioreactors45,46 or complex in vitro differentiation strategies47. Blood-derived mononuclear cells combined with monocyte-derived dendritic cells can stimulate IgM and cytokine secretion consistent with an adaptive immune response45,48. It is questionable whether in vitro matured dendritic cells recapitulate the conditions that coordinate T and B cell responses in lymphoid tissues. More importantly, a major limitation of bioreactor systems is that they do not show mature GCs, class switching or affinity maturation49, likely because many cells required for GC function are absent from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Recent work illustrated that key aspects of the immune microenvironment can be captured in organoids in several studies that focused on conferring immune protection upon transplantation into mice50,51 or recapitulating features of the GC response52,53. In these studies, designer hydrogel scaffolds for B cells combined with engineered fibroblasts were used to reveal transcriptional feedback loops involved in GC formation52 but lacked antigen specificity. Most recently, maleimide-functionalized hydrogel was shown to support GC B cell activation and an antigen-specific response in murine B cell organoid cultures53. However, these methods do not incorporate autologous APCs nor T cells that are both crucial to refine the adaptive immune response in vivo. Due to the need for bioengineered fibroblast cell lines to provide necessary survival signals, these techniques are challenging to translate to human cells because of the diversity of human leukocyte antigen genes and generation of mixed leukocyte reactions. Previous techniques to produce in vitro models of human adaptive immunity have not been widely adopted because of reliance on specialized equipment or challenging technical protocols, poor throughput, lack of evidence for antigen-specific responses, affinity maturation and/or absence of cells known to be crucial to important features of adaptive immunity. Although humanized mice are increasingly used, they are expensive to procure and still have many limitations in terms of recapitulating human immunity54.Although this is a powerful system to assess various aspects of adaptive immunity to influenza antigens, there are some limitations. It has been established that the LAIV is less effective than the inactivated formulation in adults55, presumably due to the presence of preexisting antibodies at mucosal sites in non-naive individuals. Such conditions could theoretically be mimicked by introducing autologous serum or spiking in influenza-specific antibodies at the initiation of organoid culture. Another challenge is benchmarking against in vivo tissue responses from immunized humans; such studies are now underway to characterize tonsil and lymph node responses to immunization in situ and compare them to organoid cultures. Finally, the system we describe here involves an immunological organ model in isolation. In a true infection or immunization, the antigens first encounter immune cells at a distal site (for example, skin, muscle and nasopharyngeal mucosa) and then migrate to the lymph nodes, tonsils or spleen where GCs form and B cells are selected. Many adjuvants regulate immune cell migration and local microenvironmental characteristics that are not well captured in tonsil organoids in isolation and thus would not be well suited for studying using this model, although adjuvants that act directly on immune cells can be investigated. Future studies will aim to incorporate these migratory features to capture additional features of the adaptive response in humans.MethodsInformed consent and sample collectionWhole tonsils from 150 consented individuals undergoing surgery for obstructive sleep apnea, hypertrophy or recurrent tonsillitis were collected in accordance with the Stanford University Institutional Review Board (IRB). Ethics approval was granted by the Stanford University IRB (protocols 30837 and 47690). Written informed consent was obtained from adult participants and from the legal guardians of children aged 0–17 years; written informed assent was also obtained from children aged 7 years and older. In this cohort, the participants were children aged 2–17 years (n = 57) and adults (n = 3) who had surgery for obstructive sleep apnea and/or hypertrophy, and overall, tonsil tissue was typically healthy. Whole tonsils were collected in saline after surgery and then immersed in an antimicrobial bath of Ham’s F12 medium (Gibco) containing Normocin (InvivoGen), penicillin and streptomycin for 1 h at 4 °C for decontamination of the tissue. Tonsils were then briefly rinsed with PBS and processed as needed for culturing (see below).Donor lung lymph nodes and spleens were provided by the Gift of Hope Organ and Tissue Donor Network to the University of Chicago. These tissues were determined to have IRB Exempt Status by the University of Chicago IRB. Only de-identified demographic information was obtained.Tissue and organoid preparationFor cryopreservation of tonsil cells, tissue was dissected into roughly 5 mm × 5 mm × 5 mm pieces and manually disrupted into a suspension by processing through a 100-μm strainer with a syringe plunger. Enzymatic dissociation was not necessary and did not improve the response to LAIV from cryopreserved cells. Tissue debris was reduced by Ficoll density gradient separation, although this step was not required for tonsil organoid development. After washing with complete medium (RPMI with glutamax, 10% FBS, 1× nonessential amino acids, 1× sodium pyruvate, 1× penicillin–streptomycin, 1× Normocin (InvivoGen) and 1× insulin/seleniumransferrin cocktail (Gibco)), cells were enumerated and frozen into aliquots in FBS + 10% DMSO. Frozen cells were stored at −140 °C until use.For lung-draining lymph nodes and spleen samples, tissues were collected in saline or Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution, diced into small pieces and pressed through nylon mesh (Nitex) to break up the tissue. Cells were isolated with Ficoll density gradient separation, washed, enumerated and frozen in FBS + 10% DMSO. Frozen samples were stored in liquid nitrogen until use.For culture of cryopreserved cells, aliquots were thawed into complete medium, enumerated and resuspended to 6 × 107 cells per ml for larger cultures or 2 × 107 cells per ml for smaller cultures. Cells were plated, 100 μl per well, into permeable (0.4-μm pore size) membranes (24-well size PTFE or polycarbonate membranes in standard 12-well plates or 96-well polycarbonate membrane plates with single-well receiver trays; Corning or Millipore), with the lower chamber consisting of complete medium (1 ml for 12-well plates, 200 μl for 96-well plates) supplemented with 1 μg ml−1 of recombinant human B cell-activating factor (BAFF; BioLegend). Adding a small amount of BAFF improved total B cell survival (and thus increased overall cell recovery) but was not a requirement for plasmablast differentiation or antibody secretion.LAIV (1 μl per well, equivalent of 1.6 × 104 to 1.6 × 105 fluorescent focus units per strain; FluMist Quadrivalent, Medimmune), wild-type influenza virus (A/California/07/2009 pandemic strain; a gift from H. Greenberg and X.-S. He), MMR vaccine (5 μl per culture; Merck), R-phycoerythrin (1 μg per culture; Thermo Fisher), rabies vaccine (10 μl per culture; Imovax, Sanofi Pasteur) or Ad5-vectored SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate (1 × 108 infectious units per culture; Vaxart) was then added directly to the cell-containing portion of the culture setup. For adjuvant testing, alum (0.01%; InvivoGen, sold as a 2% stock wet gel with 9–11 mg ml−1 stock aluminum content) or imiquimod (2.5 μg ml−1; InvivoGen) was added directly into the culture immediately after antigen addition. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 with humidity and supplemented with additional medium to the lower wells as necessary. Hypoxic conditions (5% O2) were tested for B cell differentiation and antibody secretion and were not significantly different from cultures maintained at standard incubator oxygen levels (17–21%).For the Ad5-vectored vaccine candidates, recombinant adenoviral constructs were produced using the publicly available SARS-CoV-2 DNA sequence (GenBank accession no. MN908947.3). Spike and nucleocapsid protein sequences were synthesized and codon optimized for expression in human cells and cloned into the E1 region as previously described56. The same vector backbone has been used previously in clinical trials for oral recombinant adenovirus tablets57,58. The Ad-S adenoviral vector contains a spike protein under the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. The Ad-SN vector contains spike under the CMV promoter and nucleocapsid under the human beta-actin promoter. The recombinant Ad-S1N vector uses a fusion sequence combining the S1 region of the SARS-CoV-2 spike gene (including the native furin site between S1 and S2) with the full-length SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid gene. All vaccine candidates were purified by cesium chloride density centrifugation and provided in a liquid form for cell culture experiments.Flow cytometryOrganoids were harvested from the upper portion of the permeable membranes by rinsing the membranes with PBS. Cells were washed with FACS buffer (PBS + 0.1% BSA, 0.05% sodium azide and 2 mM EDTA) and stained at 4 °C with the following anti-human antibodies in the presence of Fc block and live/dead Aqua Zombie stain, all from BioLegend unless otherwise noted: FITC CD138 (1/100), FITC CD116 (1/100), FITC CD21 (1/50), FITC or Ax488 CXCR5 (1/33), PerCP-Cy5.5 CD8 (1/100), PerCP-Cy5.5 CD33 (1/100), PE CD19 (1/100), PE CD56 (1/100), PE gamma-delta TCR (1/100), PE-Cy7 CD27 (1/100), PE-Cy7 CD123 (1/50), PE-Cy7 CD8 (1/100), APC CD38 (1/200), APC HLA-DR (1/100), APC CD27 (1/200), Ax700 CD45 (1/100), Ax700 CD14 (1/100), APC-Cy7 IgD (1/50), APC-Cy7 CD16 (1/100), APC-Cy7 CD45RA (1/100), Pacific Blue HLA-DR (1/100), Pacific Blue PD-1 (1/50), BV605 CD3 (1/100), BV650 CD4 (1/100), BV650 CD19 (1/100), BUV395 IgM (1/20; BD Biosciences) and BUV395 CD45RA (1/20; BD Biosciences).For AID staining, after surface staining, the cells were fixed and permeabilized (eBioscience) and stained intracellularly with biotinylated anti-AID antibody (1/100; clone mAID-2; eBioscience) followed by PE-streptavidin (eBioscience). A no-AID antibody control was used to discriminate positive signal. All analyzer data were collected on BD LSRII instruments and analyzed using FlowJo (TreeStar).Tetramer stainingHLA-A2 tetramers were prepared as previously described59, with ultraviolet (UV)-sensitive peptide cleavage and exchange for the A2 immunodominant influenza M1 peptide (GILGFVFTL) or an irrelevant CMV pp65 peptide (NLVPMVATV) as a control; tetramers were prepared from the peptide-exchanged monomers by conjugation to PE-streptavidin and APC-streptavidin, respectively (eBioscience). For staining, HLA-A2 donor organoids were harvested, washed with FACS buffer and stained for 1 h at 4 °C with tetramers (0.5 μg of monomer per test) in the presence of Fc block. During the last 30 min of tetramer staining, lineage-defining antibodies were added, and samples were washed with FACS buffer. For analysis, influenza M1 tetramer-positive CD8+ T cells were identified as single-positive T cells for the influenza tetramer (negative for CMV tetramer) and with staining above a no-influenza-tetramer staining control.Antibody detection by ELISAFor detection of influenza-specific antibodies, ELISA plates (Costar) were coated with 0.1 μg per well of season-matched Fluzone Quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (based on reported total HA content from the manufacturer; Sanofi) to act as the capture antigen. For A/California HA antibody detection, recombinantly expressed soluble HA trimers were used in place of the inactivated vaccine as the capture antigen. Diluted (1:20 or 1:50) culture supernatants were added to coated, blocked plates. A human pan-influenza monoclonal IgG antibody (H1N13–M; Alpha Diagnostics) was used as a standard to estimate specific antibody concentration for experiments where antibody concentration is quantitatively defined. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human secondary antibodies to either IgM/IgG/IgA (Sigma) or Fc-IgG alone (Bethyl; adsorbed for other isotypes) were used to detect bound antibodies. Plates were developed with TMB substrate solution (Thermo Scientific), quenched with sulfuric acid and read at 450 nm. Neutralization experiments were performed by Monogram Biosciences with a pseudovirus neutralization assay with HA matching the vaccine antigen strains.For detection of total IgG, culture supernatants were diluted at 1:500 and assayed by ELISA (Thermo Scientific) following manufacturer’s instructions. For detection of MMR-specific IgG, culture supernatants were tested by ELISA (Abcam) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Supernatants were diluted at 1:2.5 with the provided sample diluent and serial twofold dilutions out to 1:40 confirmed signal specificity (data not shown). To measure rabies nucleoprotein-specific IgM and IgG, supernatants were diluted at 1:5 with specific IgM and IgG detection kits (Alpha Diagnostic).Antibody detection by protein microarrayOrganoid cultures stimulated with recombinant adenoviral vectors with SARS-CoV-2 sequences were tested for specific antibody production using a protein microarray. The technology has been previously described for the detection of influenza-specific antibodies60 and was recently adapted to include commercially available SARS-CoV-2 proteins61. The SARS-CoV-2 proteins are commercially available from Sino Biological. Briefly, day-14 culture supernatants were diluted 1:1 with blocking buffer and incubated for 30 min. Then, diluted samples were added to the microarray for overnight hybridization. The array was washed three times with Tris-buffered saline containing Tween20, then treated with Qdot-conjugated anti-IgM, IgG or IgA secondary antibodies for 2 h. After another three washes, the array was dried and read, with signal intensities representing relative antibody quantities bound to each protein spot.ImmunofluorescenceImmunofluorescence microscopy samples were prepared from frozen tonsil cells stimulated with LAIV and harvested 4 or 7 d after stimulation. Permeable membrane inserts containing organoids were gently immersed in PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C and washed three times with water. Cultures were kept at room temperature and incubated for 20 min in increasing concentrations of warmed (37 °C) OCT Compound (Fisher) diluted in PBS at 25%, 50% and 75% (vol/vol), with a final incubation in pure OCT. Samples were snap frozen on dry ice, inserts were removed with forceps, and samples were embedded in an additional layer of OCT and frozen.Embedded samples were sectioned at 25 μm and adhered to poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. Sections were dried for 4 min in a dehumidified chamber and permeabilized in acetone for 10 min at room temperature. Rehydration was performed in stain buffer (1% BSA, 1% normal goat serum and 0.01% sodium azide in PBS) for 30 min. Sections were stained first with primary unconjugated antibodies at room temperature for 3 h. Secondary antibody staining was performed for 1 h at room temperature followed by primary direct conjugate antibodies for 3 h at room temperature.Primary antibodiesImmunofluorescence staining was performed using the following antibodies at the stated concentrations: BioLegend: CD3-BV421 (SK7; 1:25), CD4-AF594 (RPA-T4; 1:50), CD19–AF647 (SJ25C1; 1:25), CXCR4 (12G5; 1:100), CD21-FITC (Bu32; 1:100), PD-1-AF488 (NAT105; 1:100), BCL-6 (IG191E/A8; 1:50); Sigma-Aldrich: CXCR5 (Polyclonal; 1:100), CD83 (Polyclonal; 1:100); Thermo Fisher: AID (ZA001; 1:100), CD8-AF488 (AMC908; 1:100), CD20-eFluor 615 (L26; 1:100), CD20-eFluor 660 (L26; 1:100); BD Biosciences: Ki67-BV421 (B56; 1:5); Fisher Science: IgD-AF488 (IgD26; 1:10).Secondary antibodiesThe following secondary antibodies from Thermo Fisher and their dilutions were used: goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) AF Plus 555 (1:200), goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) AF Plus 555 (1:200), goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) AF Plus 594 (1:200).After collecting imaging data from antibody markers, slides were stained with 1 μg ml−1 DAPI to visualize nuclear staining. Imaging was performed on an Inverted Zeiss LSM 880 confocal instrument using ×25 magnification. Sample z-stacks were taken at 2-μm slices. DAPI was stimulated at 405 nm, FITC/Alexa Fluor 488 at 488 nm, Alexa Fluor 555 at 561 nm and Alexa Fluor 594 at 594 nm. Images were processed in ImageJ (version 2.0.0). Tile stitching was performed with the Grid/Collection stitching tool using positions from files in the order defined by the image metadata. The fusion method used was Linear Blending, with Computer Overlap and Ignore Calibration (all other parameters were set to default). After despeckling, z-stacks were merged using ZProjection by Maximum Intensity and contrast adjusted to better present structure, and channels were stacked to RGB and a scale bar added.To quantify the fraction of CXCR4- and CD83-expressing cells in GC areas, GCs were cropped into two portions that resembled light and dark zone-like regions as shown on the imaging figure. CD20-, CD83- and CXCR4-positive cells were manually counted (multipoint tool in ImageJ) in addition to double- and triple-positive cells. CD83+CXCR4−CD20+ and CD83−CXCR4+CD20+ cells in each region were calculated and presented as a proportion of the total CD20+ population from the same area. To determine the mean intensities of marker expressions in light and dark zone regions, images were converted to RGB using ‘stack to RGB’ and then ‘color histogram’ was performed on each channel using ImageJ, which displays a histogram of the intensity values. The mean of each channel was used to compare the average marker expression between different regions of equivalent size.ELISpotASCs were detected using an ELISpot protocol based on work by Shah and Koelsch62. Briefly, cultures that were either stimulated for 7 d with LAIV or left unstimulated were resuspended and enumerated, then plated on inactivated influenza vaccine-coated and blocked 96-well PVDF membrane plates (Millipore). Each sample was plated with three, threefold dilutions in triplicate, and total live-cell counts ranged from 2.22 × 104 to 1.07 × 105 cells per well at a 1:9 dilution, which was used for enumeration of ASCs. Cells were incubated on these membranes, undisturbed for 5 h at 37 °C. Plates were then washed and treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG/IgA/IgM secondary antibody. After incubation overnight at 4 °C, plates were washed and developed with AEC substrate (BD), washed 20 times with water, dried, and spots were enumerated. The frequency of ASCs out of total B cells was determined from B cell flow cytometry data analysis and the direct cell enumeration counts.Single-cell RNA-seqCells from either day-0 tonsils (processed, cryopreserved and thawed) or organoids (from day 5 and day 9 after stimulation with LAIV or left unstimulated) were stained with a mixture of fluorophore-conjugated antibodies to enable sorting for CD45+CD19+CD3− B cells and for sequencing detection of DNA-tagged antibodies (CD20 clone L27, CD19 clone SJ25C1, CD71 clone L01.1, IgM clone G20-127, IgA clone A59, CD161 clone HP-3G10, CD27 clone L128, CD38 clone HIT2, IgD clone IA6-2, IgG clone G18-145, CD83 clone HB15E, CXCR4 clone 12G5, TCR Vg9 clone B3, CD3 UCHT1, CD4 clone SK3, CD8 clone RPA-T8 and CXCR5 clone RF8B2). A cocktail of DNA-tagged antibodies was used to allow manual gating on B cells (CD19+CD3−) and B cell subsets (CD27 and CD38) to identify GC B cells and naive B cells. The sorted cells were tagged with sample barcodes to enable pooling. The cells were loaded and captured from the pooled sample using the BD Rhapsody pipeline following the manufacturer’s instructions to prepare the libraries, using the targeted human immune gene panel for amplification. Libraries were sequenced using Illumina Novaseq platforms and the resulting data processed using the Rhapsody analysis pipeline. Using SeqGeq (BD) software, individual samples were debarcoded, and B cell subsets were gated based on DNA-barcoded antibodies for CD3, CD19, CD27 and CD38. Individual populations were then exported along with their gene expression profiles for analyses. UMAP dimensionality reduction was run using the R package ‘umap’ on gene (and not DNA-tagged antibody) expression profiles. For fold change expression analyses, genes that were overexpressed in GC B cells by at least 1.5-fold were plotted.B cell receptor sequencingFor isotype-switching analysis, tonsil cells from day-0 or day-7 organoids were harvested, washed with FACS buffer, and stained with a cocktail of lineage-defining antibodies as above in the presence of Fc block, then bulk sorted using a FACS Fusion or Aria II instrument. Bulk sequencing of immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangements for isotype-switching analysis was carried out as previously reported40,63. Briefly, RNA was isolated from sorted (memory CD38−CD27+, GC CD38+CD27+ and plasmablast CD38+++CD27+) cells using Trizol (Thermo Fisher) and reverse transcribed to cDNA using Superscript II (Life Technologies) primed with random hexamer primers. Amplicons from IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA and IgE were PCR amplified in separate reactions, using IGHV framework region 1 primers and isotype primers in the first constant region exon, modified to contain partial Illumina linker sequences, sample barcode sequences and randomized nucleotides to ensure sequence diversity in the initial cycles of sequencing (as described by Roskin et al.64). A second PCR was carried out to complete the Illumina linker sequences before amplicon quantification, pooling, gel extraction (Qiagen) and sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq instrument with 600-cycle kits as 2 × 300 paired-end reads40,63. Bulk BCR heavy-chain sequences were analyzed with an in-house developed pipeline, based on IgBLAST for V, D and J gene segment alignment and CDR-H3 parsing40,63. Clonally related sequences in the bulk sequencing data were identified based on shared usage of IGHV and IGHJ genes, equal CDR-H3 length and single-linkage clustering of CDR-H3 nucleotide sequences at a 90% identity threshold.For analyses of somatic hypermutation and A/California 2009 HA-specific B cells, tonsil cells from day-0 or day-7 organoids were harvested, washed with FACS buffer, then treated with 2 μg per sample (4 μg ml−1) of biotinylated recombinant A/California influenza HA1 hemagglutinin (Y98F mutant; a gift from B. Graham and the Vaccine Research Center) in the presence of Fc block, then washed and stained with 0.2 μg ml−1 of fluorescently labeled streptavidin and a cocktail of lineage-defining antibodies.For single-cell sorting, HA+ B cells of GC or plasmablast phenotype (CD38+CD27+ or CD38+++CD27+, respectively) were sorted. Single-cell antibody sequencing was performed as previously described38,65,66,67. After single-cell sorting into 96-well plates, cDNAs were labeled with well-specific barcode oligonucleotides and pooled by plate, followed by gene-specific PCR and library preparation with previously reported primer sequences65. Libraries were sequenced with Illumina MiSeq 2 × 300 paired-end sequencing. Sequence analysis was performed as previously described65. Briefly, fastq generation and plate demultiplexing were completed using the onboard MiSeq Generate FASTQ workflow. After quality filtering, paired reads were stitched, separated by well ID and consensus sequences determined by clustering well ID reads into operational taxonomic units68. Consensus operational taxonomic unit sequences were analyzed with version 1.5.7.1 of IMGT HighV-QUEST69. For single-cell data, clonal families were defined by the same V and J gene usage and at least 70% amino acid identity in the CDR3 locus for both heavy and light chains. A caveat of single-cell HA-specific B cell sequencing is that the most vigorously responding B cells may have reduced surface immunoglobulin expression as they convert to antibody secretion, and so it is possible that the highest ASCs could not be captured during HA-specific B cell sorting.Bulk IgH sequencing and analysis was performed using MIDCIRS as previously described70. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq with the v3, 600-cycle kit. mRNA molecules were tagged with 12N randomized molecular identifiers (MIDs) during reverse transcription. Reads with the same MID were grouped together and then further clustered into subgroups based on 85% sequence similarity to separate distinct mRNA molecules that were tagged with the same MID. Consensus sequences were then formed from the MID subgroups to average out PCR and sequencing errors and mitigate amplification and sequencing bias. Clonal lineages were defined using single-linkage clustering on the consensus sequences with the same criteria as above. The size of the clonal lineage refers to the total number of consensus sequences, or mRNA molecules, that make up the lineage, while the diversity of the lineage refers to the number of unique consensus sequences within the lineage.To infer HA specificity of total, unsorted B cells from day-7 tonsil cultures, all FACS-sorted, HA-specific B cell sequences were first grouped together (n = 20,977). Then, all nucleotide sequences were translated to amino acid sequences, and each day-7 sequence was aligned to the pool of HA+ sequences to find the minimum distance to the nearest HA-specific sequence. If any sequence within a clonal lineage was found to be an exact match or one substitution away from a known HA-specific sequence, the lineage was labeled ‘HA-inferred’. Clonal lineages were then split into HA-inferred and non-A/California HA for further analysis.Affinity binding experimentsBinding affinities of the indicated antigens to antibody-containing supernatant samples were determined by biolayer interferometry using an Octet QK instrument (Pall ForteBio). For analysis of the effects of T cells on antibody responses, antibodies were purified from culture supernatants using a Protein G affinity column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The full-length, head and stem domain H1 CA/09 HA antigens were purified as described previously using a Ni-NTA affinity column followed by size-exclusion cleanup71,72. The purified antigens were captured on anti-penta-his (HIS1K) biosensor tips in PBS-T (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (pH 7.4)). The ligand-bound sensors were dipped into control wells or purified antibodies (200–500 nM). A similar antibody concentration was used for all the evaluated conditions from an individual donor. Unliganded sensors dipped into the analyte served as controls for nonspecific binding. The traces were processed using ForteBio Data Analysis Software (v8.0). The data were fitted globally to a simple 1:1 Langmuir interaction model to obtain the kinetic parameters. Each binding interaction was repeated at least thrice.Cell depletion experimentsThawed tonsil cells were stained and bulk sorted into culture medium using a FACS Aria II or Fusion (BD). Sorting experiments involved separating individual cell subsets using the following markers: myeloid cells and DCs (CD45+ CD3−CD19−HLA-DR+, CD116+ or CD33+), pDCs (CD45+CD3−CD19−HLA-DR+CD123+), Treg cells (CD45+CD3+CD19− CD4+ CD25+ CD127lo), total B cells (CD45+CD3−CD19+), non-naive B cells (CD38+ and/or CD27+IgM− and/or IgD−), naive B cells (CD38−CD27−IgM+IgD+), pre-GC B cells (CD38+CD27−), GC B cells (CD38+CD27+), memory B cells (CD38−CD27+) and plasmablasts/plasma cells (CD38+++CD27+). Cell types were depleted by FACS from day-0 tonsil cells and cultured with LAIV for 7 d. As controls, depleted cultures were reconstituted with the cell type that was originally sorted and plated at the same cell density as the depleted cultures. For depletion of HA-specific B cells, tonsil samples were stained as described in ‘BCR sequencing’ and HA-specific B cells were defined as CD45+CD19+CD3−HA+. A post-sort analysis was used to ensure depletion purity.Statistical analysisAll statistical analyses were performed in R. For comparing paired samples (frequencies of plasmablasts and antibody secretion in unstimulated versus LAIV-stimulated cultures, standard versus Transwell responses, unstimulated versus MMR-stimulated cultures, somatic hypermutation analyses, studying the effect of CD4+ cell depletion on plasmablast differentiation and specific antibody secretion), paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (two-sided) were performed. To analyze the CD4 depletion effect in young versus older children, unpaired Mann–Whitney U tests (two-sided) were performed. Welch’s t-tests (two-sided) were used to compare the somatic hypermutation levels between culture conditions and the clone size and diversity of inferred HA-specific and nonspecific B cell lineages. Two-sided, paired t-tests were used to compare the effect of PE stimulation with and without adjuvants on the frequency of PE+ B cells.Reporting SummaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

The number of spots detected are shown in the corner of each well. c, Comparison of organoid cultures grown in standard flat-bottom wells vs. transwells. Data shown are from day 7 LAIV-stimulated cultures (n = 6 donors). p values shown were determined with paired Wilcoxon signed-rank two-sided tests. Boxplots show median values with hinges representing first and third quartiles and whiskers representing the highest and lowest value that is within 1.5X the interquartile range of the hinges. d, Correlation between specific Ab secretion and plasmablast frequency in influenza-stimulated and unstimulated cultures on day 7. Detection of influenza-specific IgG antibodies by semi-quantitative indirect ELISA. Optical density was corrected for background using unspent culture medium as a control. Each donor (n = 15) was tested under four conditions: no stimulation, IIV-stimulated, LAIV-stimulated, or H1N1 WT virus-stimulated. Plasmablast (CD19+ CD38+++ CD27+) frequencies were determined by flow cytometry.Extended Data Fig. 2 Confocal imaging showing distribution of different cell types and their interactions in tonsil tissue and organoid cultures.Merge does not include DAPI staining for clarity. a, One fresh tonsil tissue was stained with panels of markers to define T and B cell areas and GC structure. b, Day 4 unstimulated organoid stained for T and B cell markers. c, Day 4 LAIV organoid stained for germinal center markers. d, Day 4 unstimulated organoid stained for B and T cell distribution. e, Day 4 LAIV organoid stained for markers of T follicular helper cells. For organoid cultures (b-e), representative examples are shown from organoid cultures derived from three different donors.Extended Data Fig. 3 Quantification of organoid organization and function.a, Quantification of CXCR4 and CD83 expression levels (mean intensity, left panel) and percent positive (percentage of CD20+B cells, right panel) in day 4 tonsil organoids from one donor. Two areas of an LAIV-stimulated organoid (top GC and bottom GC as also shown in Fig. 3a) and a representative GC-organized area from an unstimulated organoid were used for the calculation. b, Representative intracellular AID flow cytometry staining profiles. Data shown are from a day 4, LAIV-stimulated organoid culture. Total B cells were subsetted based on CD38 and CD27 expression and are shown as individual profiles in red compared to a ‘no AID primary antibody’ FMO control in grey.Extended Data Fig. 4 B cell receptor sequencing from HA-specific B cells.a, Phylogenetic trees from two donors are shown (top). Day 0 clones are indicated by black points. Different isotypes (IgM, IgA, IgG) are indicated by color (green, blue, and red respectively). Oligoclonal populations and clonal families from single cell data are represented by larger points (open circles). Clonal families were defined as BCR sequences that use the same V and J genes and have at least 70% amino acid identity in the CDR3 region for heavy and light chains. b, FACS staining and B cell phenotypes of HA-specific B cells compared to the total B cell pool.Extended Data Fig. 5 Tracking individual heavy-chain BCR lineages before and after LAIV stimulation in tonsil organoids show evidence of isotype switching.Immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangements for each isotype were sequenced from total memory B cells, germinal center B cells, and plasmablasts sorted from cultures of four donors on days 0 and 7. Heavy-chain BCR sequences from lineages that contained members as only IgM on day 0 and as only isotype-switched on day 7 were compared for their somatic hypermutation levels. For each lineage, the mean SHM was calculated for day 0 IgM members and for day 7 switched members, and the difference between these means was plotted. Lineages with increased mutation are shown in blue and those with decreased mutation in red.Extended Data Fig. 6 Depletion of pre-existing HA-specific and non-naive B cells do not prevent production of new high-affinity HA+ B cells after organoid culture.B cells with high affinity BCRs for A/California 2009 HA+ and all non-naive B cells were depleted by FACS and depletion was confirmed by post-sort analysis. After 10 days in organoid culture, cells were harvested, re-stained for A/California HA+ B cells, and run on a flow cytometer. n = 4 donors were tested.Extended Data Fig. 7 Effects of cell depletion on influenza-specific antibodies and their affinities.a, Rescue of plasmablast and Ab responses to LAIV stimulation by supplementing pDC-depleted cultures with type I IFNs. b, Frequency of CD4+ T cells (of live cells) in intact and CD4-depleted cultures on day 7. CD4+ cells were depleted by positive selection with magnetic particles. c, Biolayer interferometry data indicating Ab affinity for A/California 2009 H1N1 HA full length, head-specific, and stem domains. Colors are matched to patient samples in (b).Extended Data Fig. 8 SARS-CoV2-specific Abs detected in organoid cultures stimulated with Ad5 vectored vaccine candidates.Day 14 post-stimulation culture supernatants were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV2-specific IgM, IgG, and IgA in n = 12 donors. Abs were detected using a protein microarray. Individuals donors are represented by symbols. The signal intensities shown were background subtracted based on unstimulated control cultures from the same donor. Boxplots show median values with hinges representing first and third quartiles and whiskers representing the highest and lowest value that is within 1.5X the interquartile range of the hinges.Supplementary informationReporting SummarySupplementary Table 1Lymphoid tissue donor characteristics.

Here we show that, by using data from multiple sites collectively, accurate estimation and forecasting of respiratory diseases for locations without surveillance is feasible. We develop a framework to optimize surveillance sites that suppresses uncertainty propagation in a networked disease transmission model. Using influenza outbreaks from 35 US states, the optimized system generates better near-term predictions than alternate systems designed using population and human mobility. We also find that monitoring regional population centers serves as a reasonable proxy for the optimized network and could direct surveillance for diseases with limited records. The proxy method is validated using model simulations for 3,108 US counties and historical data for two other respiratory pathogens – human metapneumovirus and seasonal coronavirus – from 35 US states and can be used to guide systemic allocation of surveillance efforts.

Sentinel surveillance and operational real-time forecasting systems are decision support tools that help improve the prevention and control of these pathogens2. A number of forecasting methods for influenza have been developed recently3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. In the last few years, some of these systems have been applied operationally to forecast influenza outbreaks in the United States15,16,17, demonstrating the feasibility of real-time prediction.Surveillance data are necessary to support real-time operational forecasting. However, many locations lack sufficient resources to maintain high-quality, continuous surveillance18,19,20. This data shortcoming limits infectious disease monitoring and forecasting at those sites. At the same time, network modeling approaches that dynamically couple disease transmission across multiple locations are widely used for infectious disease simulation21,22,23,24. These models have been recently leveraged to simulate, monitor, and forecast epidemic outbreaks. For instance, metapopulation models informed by observed human movement (air-transportation25,26,27, mobile phone location28,29, work commuting30,31,32, etc.) have supported better understanding and forecasting of the spatial spread of influenza13,26,27,33,34, dengue29, malaria28, and COVID-1935,36,37,38. Further, statistical correlations of disease activity at multiple sites have enabled improved surveillance of real-time influenza incidence (i.e., nowcasting)39. This coupling of disease activity through time and across locations suggests that infectious disease monitoring and forecasting at locations lacking surveillance capacity may be possible. To support such efforts, there is a need for developing methods that optimize disease surveillance and forecasting using incomplete data.A number of studies have explored the optimization of disease surveillance systems from a variety of perspectives. Approaches include the development of a method to select sentinel providers for influenza in Iowa that maximizes the population covered by the surveillance network18 and the design of surveillance systems that sequentially recruit sentinel sites that most improve system estimation of influenza-like illness hospitalizations19. This latter optimization method, applied to influenza surveillance in Texas19 and arbovirus surveillance in Puerto Rico40, employs submodular optimization to provide a performance guarantee41. Another approach evaluated strategies for selecting sensors in a social network and found that the optimal choice depends on public health goals, network structure, and disease transmissibility42. More recently, there has been a growing interest in combining and optimizing the inclusion of non-traditional data sources such as online search queries and social media activities43,44.In this study, we demonstrate that forecasting for locations without surveillance is possible using data streams from multiple other locations collectively in a networked, mechanistic, forecasting system informed by human movement (see “Materials and Methods”). In this system, a mobility-driven metapopulation model describing the spatiotemporal transmission of respiratory virus across locations is iteratively updated using the latest observed incidence13. Observations from one location are used to adjust the model state and estimate incidence in other locations, including those without surveillance. The optimized model is then evolved into the future to generate forecasts (Fig. 1a). Such networked systems enable inference and prediction of local disease activity in locations lacking observations and provide a framework for designing cost-effective surveillance and forecasting systems in circumstances constrained by limited resources.Fig. 1: The networked forecasting system and uncertainty propagation.a Schematic illustration of the networked forecasting system. At each observation time point, incidence data from 3 locations (vertical arrows) are used to adjust the dynamical model consisting of 5 connected locations. The adjusted model is then evolved forward (horizontal arrows) to the next observation time point, and ultimately further into the future to generate a forecast.

(c) Comparison of forecast error (mean absolute error) for 1-week ahead prediction with (red line) and without (blue line) surveillance data. The forecast error at each predicted lead (negative/positive: before/after predicted peak) was averaged over all 35 locations for versions with and without surveillance data. (d) Uncertainty propagation in the networked forecasting system. At time t, the prior state is updated to a posterior using available observations (red cross), which constrains the model toward the truth (dash line). The reduction of uncertainty x due to data assimilation and its growth during model integration can be approximated by x ⇒ Px and Px ⇒ MPx.Full size imageResultsForecasting with incomplete informationWe performed a preliminary forecasting experiment for influenza outbreaks in 35 US states in which data from a single surveillance site were omitted. Specifically, we used the ILI (influenza-like illness) rate among all people seeking medical attention multiplied by the percentage of patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza type A, termed ILI+45, to estimate local influenza activity (Fig. 1b, Methods, Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). In the experiment, a set of forecasts was generated with data inputs from all 35 states over 9 seasons, and a second set of forecasts over 9 seasons was generated with data inputs from 34 states, omitting data from one state in turn (Supplementary Note 2). The forecast mean absolute error in the omitted state was averaged over all 35 locations for versions with and without surveillance data. Forecast errors of near-term predictions for 1- to 4-week ahead ILI+ indicate that omitting data from a single surveillance site does not seriously degrade forecast accuracy in the omitted locations (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 2).The ability to estimate and forecast disease activity for locations without observations poses an additional question: can a limited number of surveillance sites be optimally identified in order to support accurate estimation and forecasting of disease activity at all sites in a network? This question motivates the design of a quantitative framework for the optimal selection of surveillance sites within a network. In disease surveillance, incomplete and imperfect observation leads to uncertainty in the estimation of disease activity, which disrupts surveillance, forecasting, and prevention and control efforts. This uncertainty should be minimized (see discussions in Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Fig. 3); however, due to the nonlinear evolution of infectious disease transmission, uncertainty can grow over time46,47. This uncertainty propagation compromises the accuracy of both surveillance and forecasting: accumulated uncertainty growth from prior observations can undermine the understanding of the current disease situation (i.e., surveillance), and prospective uncertainty growth can limit prediction of future incidence (i.e., forecast). This effect is clearly evident in influenza forecasting for which smaller uncertainty across a forecast ensemble generally implies a better prediction3,5,10,13. Leveraging this relationship, an effective surveillance network should be designed to collect the most informative data that best suppresses uncertainty growth.Uncertainty propagationHere we develop a framework to quantify the spatiotemporal propagation of uncertainty in a networked forecasting system. We characterize the evolution of uncertainty in the estimated infected and susceptible populations. For m locations, a binary vector p = (p1,…, pm)T is used to record whether location i is selected for surveillance (pi = 1) or omitted (pi = 0). We denote the vector of uncertainty as \({\mathbf{x}} = \left( {\sigma _{I_1}, \ldots ,\sigma _{I_m},\sigma _{S_1}, \ldots ,\sigma _{S_m}} \right)^{\rm{T}}\), where \(\sigma _{I_i}\) and \(\sigma _{S_i}\) represent the uncertainty (here measured by standard deviation) in the estimated infected and susceptible populations at location i. The propagation of x undergoes two interacting processes during the generation of a forecast: uncertainty reduction during model update using data assimilation methods and uncertainty growth during model integration (Fig. 1d). The evolution of the uncertainty vector during a short time interval can be approximated using a linear operation: x → MPx, where the diagonal matrix P quantifies the uncertainty reduction during data assimilation, and the matrix M estimates uncertainty growth in the dynamical model.Disease transmission dynamics in different locations are coupled in the mobility-driven metapopulation model. The adjacency matrix and numbers of commuters among the examined 35 US states are presented in Fig. 2a–b. The dynamical coupling enables the adjustment of infected and susceptible populations in one location using surveillance data from another. To quantify uncertainty reduction during this adjustment, we introduce a diagonal matrix P = diag (P1,…, Pm, Pm+1, …, P2m) with the diagonal elements defined as$$P_j = \sqrt {\mathop {\prod}\nolimits_{i = 1}^m {\left( {1 - p_iu_{j \leftarrow i}^I} \right)} } ,\,P_{j + m} = \sqrt {\mathop {\prod}\nolimits_{i = 1}^m {\left( {1 - p_iu_{j \leftarrow i}^S} \right)} }$$ (1) for j = 1,…, m. Here, \(u_{j \leftarrow i}^I\) and \(u_{j \leftarrow i}^S\) are the fractional variance reduction for the infected and susceptible populations in location j attributed to the observation from location i. The matrix P encodes information about the surveillance network configuration p: if a location has observations (i.e., pi = 1), uncertainty in this location and other dynamically coupled locations is reduced; otherwise (i.e., pi = 0), this location makes no contribution to uncertainty reduction. After data assimilation, the prior model state is adjusted to a posterior, with the uncertain vector x updated to Px. The surveillance network configuration p determines the diagonal elements of P, thus controls the reduction of the uncertainty vector x.Fig. 2: Connectivity and uncertainty reduction across 35 US states.a The adjacency matrix for 35 US states. Adjacent states are highlighted by blue squares. b Numbers of commuters among 35 US states from the 2010 census survey. Color shows the logarithmic-transformed (base 10) commuting population from resident (x-axis) to work (y-axis) locations. Surveillance data from one state (x-axis) can reduce the uncertainty of infected (c) and susceptible (d) populations in other states (y-axis). Color indicates the reduced fraction of variance for infected and susceptible populations (uI and uS). Results are averaged over data assimilation during nine seasons.Full size imageThe values of \(u_{j \leftarrow i}^I\) and \(u_{j \leftarrow i}^S\) depend on the quality of the observation in location i. Particularly, surveillance data with less uncertainty, characterized by a smaller observational error variance (OEV), lead to a larger reduction of uncertainty in x. Thus, to calculate \(u_{j \leftarrow i}^I\) and \(u_{j \leftarrow i}^S\), a precise estimation of OEV is required; however, in practice, this is a challenging task as only one data point (ILI+) is observed per location per week. We therefore developed a method to quantify the OEV of these observations and reveal that the OEV of ILI+ is predominantly affected by the number of laboratory tests (Supplementary Note 4). In order to properly represent the uncertainty of observations, we optimized the OEV of ILI+ from different locations in retrospective forecasting so that near-term forecast error is minimized (Supplementary Fig. 4). The forms of cross-location uncertainty reduction \(u_{j \leftarrow i}^I\) and \(u_{j \leftarrow i}^S\) are derived using a state-space framework (Supplementary Note 5 and Supplementary Fig 5) and reported in Methods.We computed the mean values of \(u_{j \leftarrow i}^I\) and \(u_{j \leftarrow i}^S\) averaged over weekly influenza forecasts during 9 seasons. The surveillance data from one location i mostly affect the uncertainty of its own infected and susceptible populations (Fig. 2c–d, diagonal elements); however, for certain locations that are adjacent to location i or exchange a large number of commuters (Fig. 2a–b), the variances of infected and susceptible populations are reduced by the observation from location i as well (Fig. 2c–d, off-diagonal elements). Such cross-site uncertainty reduction indicates dynamical coupling between these pairs of locations.The reduced uncertainty Px will propagate in the networked system during model integration. The evolution of Px within a short time interval can be approximated using the linear propagator M of the transmission model that characterizes the uncertainty growth driven by the linearized model dynamics: Px → MPx. Specifically, for a short time interval δt, the linear propagator M is estimated by M ≈ I + Jδt, where I is a 2 m × 2 m unit matrix and J is the Jacobian matrix of the full nonlinear system (Supplementary Note 5). The linear approximation was shown to be valid for a few days for influenza transmission models47, and has been previously applied in numerical weather prediction46. Typical respiratory disease surveillance releases data once per week2; at this rate the linear approximation may become less accurate. As a consequence, we here limit our attention to short-term uncertainty propagation. Later retrospective forecast results indicate that this setting can improve near-term forecasts for ILI+ up to 4 weeks ahead.The optimal surveillance problemTo minimize uncertainty growth during short-term forecast, we aim to minimize the uncertainty growth rate, quantified by ‖MPx‖/‖x‖ = (xT PT MT MPx)/(xT x)46,47. This equation indicates that the uncertainty growth rate is determined by the dominant eigenvalue, λ1, of the matrix L ≡ PT MT MP. In operation, the matrices P and M vary by forecast time (i.e., how far into an outbreak a forecast is initiated) and system state. Thus, to design an optimal surveillance network for a wide range of unknown, potential outbreaks, we minimize the mean value, 〈λ1〉, averaged over different forecast initiation time points and system states. Mathematically, the task of selecting K optimal sentinel sites from m locations is transformed to the combinatorial optimization problem of finding p that minimizes 〈λ1〉 under the constraint \(\mathop {\sum}\nolimits_{i = 1}^m {p_i = K}\):$${\mathbf{p}} \ast = \arg \min \left\langle {\lambda _1\left( {{\mathbf{p}},t,{\mathbf{z}}} \right)} \right\rangle {\mathrm{subject}}\,{\mathrm{to}}\mathop {\sum}\limits_{i = 1}^m {p_i = K,p_i \in \left\{ {0,1} \right\}} .$$ (2) Here λ1 (p, t, z) is the dominant eigenvalue of L at time t with system state z given the configuration of the surveillance network p. In order to calculate λ1, we run weekly data assimilation in multiple seasons to estimate the system state z at each week. Using the surveillance network configuration p and the posterior model state z at time t, we obtain the matrices P and M, and then compute the dominant eigenvalue λ1 of L using the power method48. The mean eigenvalue is averaged over λ1(p, t, z) for different weeks and seasons.The above optimal surveillance problem is a combinatorial optimization, as the inclusion of one location is impacted by other selected locations. Solving this problem for large-scale systems is challenging as the number of configurations grows exponentially with the system size. However, for a small system forecasting respiratory disease at the US state level, this problem can be solved using standard iterative optimization techniques such as simulated annealing (SA)49 (Methods).Influenza surveillance networksWe validated the proposed framework using influenza outbreaks in 35 US states. In order to perform the optimization, historical outbreak data are required to infer model parameters and state variables so that simulation dynamics are representative of real-world influenza transmission patterns (e.g., seasonality, spatiotemporal spread, typical attack rate, etc.). Although sentinel providers tend to work locally, in practice, surveillance data collected from local sentinel providers are aggregated to coarser geographical scales for public health use. In particular, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) releases ILI surveillance data at the state, HHS (the US Department of Health and Human Services) regional and national levels50. Here we work at this operational spatial resolution and optimize the surveillance networks at the state level.For a given number of observation locations, K, we optimize the surveillance network using SA. As short-term uncertainty propagation is suppressed, we expect that the forecast accuracy of the selected network for near-term targets, for instance, 1- to 4-week ahead ILI+, will outperform surveillance systems designed using heuristic strategies that favor locations with either larger population size, a larger number of commuters (both incoming and outgoing directions), or a higher population gradient (∇Population, defined as the ratio of location population size to the average population of its adjacent neighbors).Among all strategies, SA is best at minimizing the average dominant eigenvalue (Fig. 3a), and the selected states (for K = 5, 10, 15, 20) are spread across the country (Fig. 3b). We next performed retrospective forecasting for 9 seasons at the state level (Methods, Supplementary Note 6 and Supplementary Fig. 6). In retrospective forecasting, all 35 states were included in the metapopulation model, but only surveillance data from selected states were used to calibrate the model (i.e., observations from unselected states were omitted). Using the surveillance networks optimized by SA, the forecast error of near-term predictions in the states without surveillance decreases as more states are observed, and eventually converges to the forecast error of the states with observations (Fig. 3c).Fig. 3: Surveillance network optimization for 35 US states.a The average eigenvalues of surveillance networks selected by SA (simulated annealing) (blue line), population (red line), commuter numbers (orange line), and population gradient (∇Population) (purple line).

In most cases, the SA approach significantly outperforms the other heuristic methods by generating surveillance networks that support lower forecast error (Fig. 3d, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Methods and Supplementary Fig. 7). The marginal gain of observing more locations gradually decreases, highlighting the dominant role that observations from certain key locations play in constraining influenza forecast accuracy. Comparison for 2- to 4-week ahead predictions (Supplementary Fig. 7) additionally corroborate the effective minimization of uncertainty growth by SA optimization.The forecasting system generates probabilistic forecasts. Mean absolute errors reported in Fig. 3c only measure the error of point prediction (i.e., the mean value of each ensemble forecast). In order to evaluate the full probabilistic forecasts, we compared the “log score” (Methods), defined as the logarithmic value of the probability assigned to an interval around the observed target. In essence, the log score is a summary statistic measuring the distribution of ensemble forecast error. This probabilistic scoring rule has been used in the CDC FluSight forecast challenge15,16,17. Consistent with the results for forecast error, the SA approach outperforms the other three strategies (Fig. 3e). We further examined the forecast error and log score at different times relative to the predicted peak week (Supplementary Figs. 8–9). As an example, retrospective forecasts were generated for all 35 states over 9 seasons using surveillance networks consisting of 20 states. At most predicted lead weeks, the SA optimization supports better predictions.To understand the features of networks selected by SA, we examined their similarity with networks identified using alternate heuristic methods. In addition to population size, number of commuters, and population gradient, we also investigated three other feature-driven surveillance location selection methods and compared their results with those selected by SA. These features are: (1) Absolute humidity. In temperate regions, influenza transmission is favored during periods of lower absolute humidity51. As a result, we selected locations with lower average absolute humidity with priority. (2) Population density. Higher population density may facilitate influenza transmission due to higher person-to-person contact frequency. Locations are ranked by their population density in descending order. (3) Random walk centrality. In contrast to other local features, random walk centrality is a global metric determined by the connectivity among all locations. Specifically, the random walk centrality ri for location i is the stationary visiting probability of a random walker who travels in the network following the transfer probability specified by the commuting matrix. The values of ri satisfy the self-consistent equation: \(r_i = \mathop {\sum}\nolimits_j {C_i^jr_j/N_j}\), and can be calculated through iteration (\(C_i^j\) is the number of commuters from location j to i, and Nj is the population in location j). For random walk centrality, locations are ranked according to ri in descending order.Among all examined measures, the ∇Population approach is most similar to the eigenvalue minimization approach using SA (Fig. 3f), indicating that the optimized network has a tendency to first select locations with a high ∇Population. For example, Washington state ranks only 11th and 25th by population and number of commuters among 35 examined US states; however, it ranks 3rd according to ∇Population and is selected with high priority by the eigenvalue minimization approach.An attractive alternative approach to SA to solve the optimal surveillance problem is to sequentially add locations that produce the largest marginal reduction of the eigenvalue. This greedy approach is less computationally demanding than the SA algorithm, and could have a performance guarantee if the objective function satisfies the submodular property41. A function is submodular if the marginal gain of including an additional location decreases with the number of existing surveillance sites. Unfortunately, the eigenvalue function we use here does not have this diminishing return property. Despite this circumstance, we tested a greedy algorithm approach and compared the resulting eigenvalue with the one obtained from the SA algorithm (Supplementary Fig. 10). The eigenvalue curves are identical for surveillance systems with less than 15 states and remain similar for larger systems. These findings indicate that the greedy approach is effective for this 35-state model, and may be applicable to small- and medium-sized systems. However, for large systems like the county-level transmission model, the greedy algorithm is computationally prohibitive due to the cost of calculating eigenvalues for large-scale matrices.A proxy method: population gradientThe surveillance network optimization requires historical records to compute the matrices M and P. However, disease surveillance data are typically sparse in underdeveloped settings, especially for emerging infectious diseases. Moreover, the SA algorithm is computationally expensive and prohibitive for systems with more than a few hundred locations49. For large-scale systems or diseases with limited historical records, a practical strategy to design surveillance networks is needed. Given the similarity between the surveillance networks selected by SA and ∇Population, we propose that ∇Population, a metric that is broadly available, can be used to select surveillance sites.We examined the performance of ∇Population at finer spatial resolution using synthetic influenza outbreaks generated at the county level. Specifically, error-laden observations of ILI+ for 20 outbreaks in the 3108 continental US counties were generated using the mobility-driven metapopulation model (Supplementary Note 7). We then compared the forecasting accuracy of surveillance networks constructed using various, alternate strategies. Specifically, we considered four other heuristic approaches: site selection informed by population coverage, number of commuters, diversity of commuters’ residential counties, and random selection. A recent study found that selecting sentinel surveillance sites based on the geographical diversity of patients visiting healthcare facilities performs well for arbovirus disease systems40. Here we examined a similar strategy in which counties with more diverse commuters, quantified by the Shannon diversity: H = − ∑hi ln hi, where hi is the fraction of incoming commuters living in county i, are preferentially selected. To provide an alternate strategy that avoids geographical clustering, we also included a strategy that randomly selects surveillance sites.Surveillance networks with K of 5%, 10%, 20% up to 100% of counties were compared. ∇Population outperformed competing strategies (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 11). Additionally, the marginal reduction of forecast error becomes nominal once 10% of counties are observed. This indicates that observing a small fraction of dynamically central counties is sufficient to generate satisfactory estimates and forecasts for both observed and unobserved locations, and that observing additional sites with potentially larger noise does not necessarily improve forecast accuracy. When we compare results at the state level (Fig. 3d), the advantage of using ∇Population to design surveillance networks over population and human mobility becomes even more pronounced. This indicates that spatial scale matters in selecting optimal surveillance sites. Indeed, determining the appropriate observational spatial scale that can damp excessive noise while not compromising resolution is a critical, outstanding problem in operational forecasting.Fig. 4: Surveillance networks at the county level.a Forecast error for 1-week ahead ILI+ predictions using surveillance networks consisting of 5%, 10%, 20% up to 100% of all counties. Networks are selected by population gradient (∇Population) (blue line), population (red line), commuter (orange line), diversity of commuters’ residential locations (purple line), and random selection (green line). The statistical significance for population gradient outperforming all other methods is reported using the horizontal bars on top (two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test; red: p < 0.001, orange: p < 0.01, none: p ≥ 0.01). b Overlap between the counties selected by ∇Population and those selected by other attributes: absolute humidity (blue line), population (red line), commuter (orange line), population density (purple line), random walk centrality (green line), diversity of commuters’ residential locations (light blue line), and random selection (dark red line). c Visualization of surveillance networks consisting of 10% of all counties selected by population gradient, population, commuter numbers, commuter diversity and random selection. Blue curves on the map represent county-to-county commuting. Node color indicates the ranking using different methods, and node size reflects the population size. d Comparison of the distributions of distance between nearest neighbors within surveillance networks designed using different strategies: ∇Population (blue), population (purple), commuter (red), diversity of commuters’ residential locations (orange), and random selection (green). Boxes show the median and interquartile, and whiskers show 95% CI. Distributions were obtained from n = 310, 621, 932, 1243, and 1554 counties, respectively, corresponding to 10%, 20%, 30%, 40, and 50% of all counties.Full size imageWe next compared the overlap of counties selected by ∇Population with those selected by other attributes including local absolute humidity, population, number of commuters, population density, random walk centrality, commuter diversity and random selection (Fig. 4b). With limited overlap, surveillance networks designed using alternate measures differ considerably from the network selected by ∇Population, especially for small numbers of surveillance sites. This comparison indicates that the information conveyed by ∇Population cannot be represented by the other examined metrics.The competitive performance of ∇Population is explained by its characteristic of avoiding redundant information from clusters of locations: only one population center tends to dominate a cluster of counties. The benefit of avoiding informational redundancy has previously been highlighted19. To detail this further, we visualize the surveillance networks composed of 10% of counties as selected by the ∇Population, Population, Commuter, Diversity, and Random approaches (Fig. 4c). Counties selected by the population, commuters and diversity approaches are densely clustered in a few metropolitan areas. In stark contrast, the networks selected by ∇Population are more evenly distributed across the US and are thus more representative of disease activity throughout the country. The randomly selected sites are also distributed across the US; however, many selected counties have small populations with possible large observational noise that could compromise forecasting accuracy.We quantify geographical clustering using the distribution of distance between nearest neighbors within the surveillance network. The population-, commuter- and diversity-based surveillance networks have on average a closer nearest neighbor (Fig. 4d), indicating a more clustered structure. The networks selected by the random strategy are less clustered, but the distance between nearest neighbors is still slightly lower than that of the population gradient-based networks. For the random strategy, more counties are selected in the eastern and middle US, where counties are more densely distributed. We note that the ∇Population strategy does not merely seek spatial homogeneity; it also reflects the spatial distribution of population: the surveillance sites are denser in areas with more population (Fig. 4c). The SA algorithm also exhibits cluster-avoiding tendencies: during combinatorial optimization, once a location is selected, the chance of selecting an adjacent neighbor is low as the marginal gain diminishes. This mechanism partially explains why the surveillance sites selected by the eigenvalue minimization approach are spread broadly across the US.We further validated site selection by ∇Population using historical outbreaks for two additional respiratory pathogens: human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and coronavirus (CoV) in 35 US states from 2013–2014 to 2016–2017 (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Note 8). HMPV and CoV are common ILI-causing respiratory viruses, and typically circulate in winter and early spring. In the dataset, their surveillance records are only available in 4 seasons, providing an instance of disease with limited data. Retrospective forecasts for HMPV and CoV outbreaks were generated using surveillance networks composed of different numbers of sentinel sites. Although the signals of HMPV and CoV are noisier than ILI+, due to fewer laboratory tests, the networked forecasting system is still able to predict near-term incidence using partial observations, and the ∇Population site selection approach identifies key surveillance locations that support forecasts with lower errors (Fig. 5b–c and Supplementary Fig. 12). The findings demonstrate that forecasting for a range of respiratory viruses is possible in locations without surveillance.Fig. 5: Retrospective forecasts for human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and coronavirus (CoV).a The national HMPV+ rate (blue line) and CoV+ rate (red line) for the 2013–2014 to 2016–2017 seasons from AFHSB data. Forecast errors for 1-week ahead predictions of HMPV and CoV in 35 US states from 2013 to 2017 are reported in (b) and (c). We focus on surveillance networks consisting of less than 10 states because monitoring more states only provides nominal improvement. The horizontal bar on top indicates the statistical significance for ∇Population (blue line) outperforming methods based on population (red line), number of commuters (orange line), diversity of commuters’ residential locations (purple line), and random selection (green line) (two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test; red: p < 0.001, orange: p < 0.01, none: p ≥ 0.01).Full size imageDiscussionWhile similar in performance to SA optimization, ∇Population remains a static metric, reflecting only the geographical distribution of population. In contrast, the combinatorial optimization approach using SA accounts for connectivity between locations, observation uncertainty, and evolving model dynamics, and thus more flexibly responds to surveillance practices and outbreak patterns. Nevertheless, should insufficient data (e.g., historical data or estimation of observational error) exist to perform SA optimization, the population gradient method could serve as a reasonable proxy for network site selection. Recent work has revealed the crucial role that urban centers play in incubating and driving influenza transmission52; here we identify the significant role metropolises and centers of population play in suppressing uncertainty growth.As an approximating solution to a combinatorial optimization problem, the optimized surveillance network may have multiple configurations with similar performance49, i.e., the network constructed using SA is only one of these possible choices. If certain locations are already monitored, such constraint could be properly incorporated into the optimization problem to find the conditional optimal design for adding more surveillance sites.Network approaches are increasingly employed in infectious disease modeling, surveillance, and forecasting. In these applications, networked models are usually fitted to real-world observations using computational Bayesian techniques (e.g., Markov Chain Monte Carlo53, particle filter54, Kalman filter55, approximate Bayesian computation56, etc.). Through this model calibration process, distributions of prior and posterior model states are obtained. This allows the direct quantification of uncertainty propagation when theoretical analysis is intractable and facilitates the generalization of the framework proposed in this study. One possible application would be to assess the value of specific observations and design proactive and adaptive observations (in space and time) in response to an ongoing outbreak.In the framework used here, important factors affecting influenza outbreaks (e.g., vaccination coverage and effectiveness, mixing patterns within and across age groups, antigenic drift, etc.) were not explicitly represented in the dynamical model. Directly accounting for those factors could potentially further reduce model misspecification and improve the selection of an optimal network. We also only compared the optimization framework with simple location features such as population size and number of commuters. In the future, other more sophisticated strategies for designing surveillance networks could be considered should data and resource availability be sufficient to support proper implementation. Also, the framework only considers the short-term evolution of uncertainty in a linearized approximation. A quantification of longer-term uncertainty propagation in the full nonlinear model would be needed to enhance and optimize the forecast of seasonal targets such as peak timing and peak intensity.MethodsData descriptionWe used patient syndromic influenza-like illness (ILI) data and laboratory test results from the US Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch (AFHSB) to estimate state-level respiratory disease activity (Supplementary Note 1). We focused on the 35 US states in the AFHSB dataset with substantive ILI and test records. For influenza, we used ILI+, defined as the weekly ILI rate among patients seeking medical attention multiplied by the concurrent weekly positivity rate for influenza type A in laboratory testing, to reflect local influenza activity spanning 9 seasons from 2008–2009 to 2016–2017. For HMPV and CoV, laboratory test results are only available for 4 seasons from 2013–2014 to 2016–2017. Similarly, we used ILI multiplied by concurrent positivity rates for these viruses, termed HMPV+ and CoV+ respectively, to estimate disease activity in each state. The ILI visit and laboratory test data were stored in MySQL 8.0 and analyzed in MATLAB 2015b. The use of the deidentified dataset in this study was approved by AFHSB. All relevant ethical regulations were followed.Local absolute humidity (AH) conditions for each state and county were obtained from North American Land Data Assimilation System data57. A daily AH climatology of conditions averaged over a 24-year period from 1979 to 2002 was used. County-to-county commuting data, obtained from the 2009–2013 American Community Surveys, were used to approximate human movement. This dataset, publicly available from the United States Census Bureau website, provides commuting population estimates across all US counties58. Given that the survey period (2009–2013) is close to the forecast seasons, we assume the commuting patterns reported in the census survey data are representative of the study period.Forecasting frameworkWe describe the transmission of respiratory pathogens using a metapopulation SIRS (susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible) model, in which different locations are connected by human mobility. In practice, detailed information about human movement is not available in real time. To address this issue, we assume the volume of human movement between two locations is proportional to the average number of commuters between them. Denote \(C_j^i\) as the number of commuters living in location i and commuting to work in location j. The number of visitors from location i to j is assumed to be \(\theta \bar C_j^i\), where θ is an adjustable parameter and \(\bar C_j^i\) is the average commuters between location i and j. The evolution of transmission is then described by$$\frac{{{\rm{d}}I_i}}{{{\rm{d}}t}} = \frac{{\beta _iS_iI_i}}{{N_i}} - \frac{{I_i}}{D} - \frac{{\theta I_i}}{{N_i}}\mathop {\sum}\limits_{j \ne i} {\bar C_j^i} + \theta \mathop {\sum}\limits_{j \ne i} {\frac{{\bar C_i^jI_j}}{{N_j}}} ,$$ (3) $$\frac{{{\rm{d}}S_i}}{{{\rm{d}}t}} = \frac{{N_i - S_i - I_i}}{L} - \frac{{\beta _iS_iI_i}}{{N_i}} - \frac{{\theta S_i}}{{N_i}}\mathop {\sum}\limits_{j \ne i} {\bar C_j^i} + \theta \mathop {\sum}\limits_{j \ne i} {\frac{{\bar C_i^jS_j}}{{N_j}}} .$$ (4) Here Ni, Si, and Ii are the number of total, susceptible, and infected population in location i; D is the average duration of infection; L is the average during of immunity; and βi is the transmission rate in location i. The last two terms in the above equations describe the exchange of population due to human movement. For influenza, the transmission rate is modulated by local AH conditions through βi(t) = [exp(a × qi(t) + log(R0max − R0min)) + R0min]/D, where qi(t) is daily specific humidity, a measure of AH. The parameter a = − 180 is estimated from laboratory experiments of the impact of AH on influenza virus survival. R0max and R0min are the maximum and minimum daily basic reproductive numbers inferred during data assimilation. For HMPV and CoV, we assume the transmission rate is constant and identical across locations.The transmission model is coupled with a data assimilation algorithm to optimize the model state using observed incidence data in real time. Specifically, we used the Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF)59 in which the distribution of the model state is represented by an ensemble of state vectors. During data assimilation, this ensemble is iteratively updated so that the model better estimates the underlying unknown truth. The optimized dynamical model is then integrated into the future to generate probabilistic forecasts. Similar model-data assimilation forecast frameworks have been successfully used for forecasting and inference of a variety of infectious diseases3,60,61,62,63,64,65. Details about the system configuration can be found in Supplementary Note 2. The EAKF algorithm was coded in MATLAB 2015b.Cross-location uncertainty reductionWe derived the form of \(u_{j \leftarrow i}^I\) and \(u_{j \leftarrow i}^S\) analytically using a state-space framework (Supplementary Note 5):$$u_{j \leftarrow i}^I = \frac{{\sigma _{y_iI_j}^2}}{{\left( {R_i + \sigma _{y_i}^2} \right)\sigma _{I_j}^2}},u_{j \leftarrow i}^S = \frac{{\sigma _{y_iS_j}^2}}{{\left( {R_i + \sigma _{y_i}^2} \right)\sigma _{S_j}^2}},$$ (5) where yi is the prior incidence (i.e., simulated ILI+ rate) in location i, \(\sigma _{y_iI_j}\) (\(\sigma _{y_iS_j}\)) is the covariance between the prior incidence in location i and the prior infected (susceptible) population in location j, Ri is the OEV of the observation from location i, \(\sigma _{y_i}^2\) is the variance of the prior incidence in location i, and \(\sigma _{I_j}^2\) (\(\sigma _{S_j}^2\)) is the variance of the prior infected (susceptible) population in location j. Note that \(\sigma _{y_iI_j}\) (\(\sigma _{y_iS_j}\)) quantifies the dynamical coupling between the observed state variable (simulated ILI+) in location i and the infected (susceptible) population in location j. In addition, a more uncertain observation in location i (i.e., a larger Ri) leads to a smaller reduction of uncertainty in Ij and Sj. In practice, the quantities defining \(u_{j \leftarrow i}^I\) and \(u_{j \leftarrow i}^S\) in Eq. (5) can be computed numerically using the state-vector ensemble during data assimilation. We validated Eq. (5) in retrospective forecasts of influenza outbreaks over 9 seasons (Supplementary Fig. 5). The actual uncertainty reduction in the state-vector ensemble agrees well with the values calculated using Eq. (5).Optimization using simulated annealingThe configuration vector p can be optimized using general iterative optimization algorithms such as simulated annealing (SA)49. In SA, the energy function E(p) is defined as E(p) = 〈λ1(p, t, z)〉. Starting from a random initial configuration that satisfies \(\mathop {\sum}\nolimits_{i = 1}^m {p_i = K}\), at each step k, the current configuration vector pk is perturbed to \({\mathbf{p}}_k^\prime\) under constraint of the number of selected locations. This procedure can be realized by swapping the states of a randomly chosen couple of selected and omitted locations. The change in energy, \({\Delta} E = E\left( {{\mathbf{p}}_k^\prime } \right) - E({\mathbf{p}}_k)\), can then be calculated directly from the ensemble of eigenvalues. If ΔE < 0, the perturbation is accepted and the new configuration is used as the starting point for the next step \({\mathbf{p}}_{k + 1} = {\mathbf{p}}_k^\prime\). Otherwise, the new configuration is only accepted with a probability P(ΔE) = exp(−ΔE/(κBTk)), where κB is a constant and Tk is a time-varying parameter called temperature. In implementation, the annealing schedule starts from a high temperature T0, where essentially all perturbations can be accepted, and then gradually cools down to a low temperature with a decreasing probability of accepting worse configurations. The algorithm stops when the number of attempts exceeds a certain threshold value before a new configuration is accepted. The final configuration p∞ is the estimated optimal solution to the optimization problem. In our implementation, we used κB = 0.1, an exponentially decreasing temperature Tk = 0.9997k and a maximal iteration number of kmax = 30,000. The stopping threshold was set at 3000.Evaluation of retrospective forecastingWe examined forecast accuracy for 4 short-term targets: 1- to 4-week ahead ILI+ rates. The performance of forecast accuracy is evaluated using two measures: mean absolute error (MAE) and log score. MAE is calculated as the difference between the predicted ensemble mean and the observed ILI+ rate. Log score is defined as the log value of the probability assigned to the interval of width 0.01 centered at the observed ILI+ rate (0.005 on each side)15,16,17.In order to examine whether the SA algorithm statistically significantly outperforms the other three strategies in retrospective forecasting for influenza outbreaks, we performed a Wilcoxon signed-rank test on three pairs of methods: SA-Population, SA-Commuter, and SA-∇Population. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is a non-parametric statistical test that compares two paired samples (here, paired MAEs or log scores generated by both examined methods for the same location at the same forecast week) to assess whether their mean-ranks differ66. We performed a two-sided test to return a p-value indicating that SA outperforms the other method. We calculated the p-values for the three pairs of comparison (SA-Population, SA-Commuter, and SA-∇Population) for each of the four targets. The p-values reported in Fig. 3d–e are the maximal p-values among all three tests (i.e., the worst case). The same analysis was performed for forecasting at the county level and for HMPV and CoV.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

(IANS)Bird flu has been confirmed in seven states of the country so far, namely Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, while test reports of unusual death of birds received from Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Delhi are awaited, the Union Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying said on Saturday.Bird flu or avian influenza is a highly contagious viral infection among birds, although it is also capable of infecting humans and other animals. It is caused by Influenza Type A viruses, which generally affect poultry birds like chickens and turkeys. As is the case with the coronavirus, the Influenza A virus also has many strains. While some are mild and merely cause a low egg production in birds, others can cause severe infections and end up being deadly for the winged creatures.As per a statement by the ministry, after confirmation of avian influenza (AI) positive samples by the ICAR-NIHSAD from two poultry farms in Panchkula district in Haryana, positive cases of bird flu in migratory birds were reported in Shivpuri, Rajgarh, Shajapur, Agar and Vidisha district in Madhya Pradesh, the zoological park in Kanpur, and Pratapgarh and Dausa districts of Rajasthan. The Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying (DAH&D) has issued an advisory to the affected states so as to avoid further spread of the disease.Human infection rare, but possibleAlthough there are several types of bird flu, the H5N1 strain of influenza is its most common form. Back in 1997, the H5N1 became the first avian influenza virus to infect humans in Hong Kong, and that outbreak was linked to handling infected poultry. At present, there is no significant evidence of the bird flu spreading via human-to-human contact. So far, almost all cases of bird flu infection in humans have been traced back to close contact with infected birds or contaminated environments.Read more: What is Bird Flu, How It Can Infect Humans, Its Symptoms, Treatment, Death Rate and MoreSo far this year, no human infection of H5N1 has been confirmed in India. As per the animal husbandry department, avian influenza has been transmitted through migratory birds in the country, a large number of which come to India during the winter season every year from Siberia.

(Nitin Sharma/BCCL Chandigarh)Reports of unusual mortality of birds in the past two days have also been received from Balod district in Chhattisgarh. The state has constituted RRT teams for emergency situation and has also sent the samples for testing to the designated laboratory. Further, reports of unusual mortality in ducks have been received from Sanjay Lake in Delhi. The samples have been sent to the designated laboratory for testing. Samples of dead crows have also been sent to NIHSAD from Mumbai, Thane, Dapoli, Parbhani and Beed districts of Maharashtra for confirmation of AI.Meanwhile, culling operations have been completed in both the affected districts of Kerala and post-operational surveillance programme guidelines have been issued to the state. Central teams deployed to visit the affected states in Kerala, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh for monitoring and for epidemiological investigation have reached their destinations, the DAH&D said.Bird flu scare grips BiharThe scare of bird flu has gripped Bihar after a large number of chickens and crows were found dead in Muzaffarpur and Bettiah, respectively, on Saturday. Chickens are found at Madhaul village under Saraiya block, confirmed Sunil Kumar, animal husbandry officer in Muzaffarpur."As soon as the matter came to our knowledge, we sent a dedicated team to the place. All dead chickens have been buried in vacant land belonging to the state government and their samples have been sent to the lab to ascertain the cause of death," the official said."As a precautionary measure, we have asked every poultry firm owner to keep the chickens indoors and make adequate arrangements so that migratory birds do not mix with them," Kumar said.Besides Muzaffarpur, over one dozen crows were found dead under mysterious circumstances at Diulia village under Narkatiaganj block in West Champaran district. A team of veterinary doctors reached the village on Friday and buried the birds. They have sent the samples to Patna for testing.AdvertisementBihar has some famous bird sanctuaries such as Kabar Jheel bird sanctuary located on the banks of Burhi Gandak river in Begusarai district, Nakti Dam bird sanctuary in Jamui district, Gogabil bird sanctuary in Bhagalpur district, Nagidam bird sanctuary in Jhajha city. These are considered as natural habitats for migratory and domestic birds in Bihar.Delhi bans import of live birdsIn the wake of the bird flu scare in the national capital, the Delhi government on Saturday banned the import of live birds into the city, while assuring the citizens that all necessary measures are being taken to tackle the disease. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal made the announcement through a digital press conference and made it clear that "there is not a single confirmed bird flu case in Delhi so far".As a precautionary measure, the Chief Minister said the government has decided to impose a complete ban on the import of live birds into the city with immediate effect. Kejriwal also announced the closure of the Ghazipur chicken mandi for the next 10 days."Delhi government is taking all necessary measures to stop the spread of bird flu in the national capital. There is nothing to worry. We are keeping track of the disease," he said."In the last few days, there have been several cases of bird flu across various parts of the country, which is a cause of worry. Cases of bird flu have been registered in Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan. No confirmed case of bird flu has been registered in Delhi until now. We have collected around 104 samples until now, which have been sent to Jalandhar for testing and examination in a laboratory. Upon receiving the results day after tomorrow, the Delhi government will take all decisions and measures based on the results," Kejriwal said.The Chief Minister added that a 24-hour helpline 23890318 has been set up to provide assistance to the people. He said that rapid response teams have been formed in every district to contain the spread of bird flu if any, and conduct proper surveillance. They will function under the district magistrates.The announcement came amid reports of 24 crows being found dead at a park in Jasola area in south Delhi in the past three days. A total of 10 ducks were also found dead at the famous Sanjay Lake in Mayur Vihar area in east Delhi. The samples of the dead ducks have been sent to the concerned lab to ascertain if they died from bird flu.The forest department of the Delhi government has been informed about the death of the ducks and employees of the Delhi Development Authority, which owns a large number of parks in the city, are monitoring the situation. In the past few days, at least 35 crows have died in Delhi. Their samples have also been sent for testing.On Friday, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia had instructed the officials to maintain a strict vigil on birds at the major bird sites, especially poultry markets, water bodies, zoos and other potential hotspots.(With inputs from IANS)**For weather, science, and COVID-19 updates on the go, download The Weather Channel App (on Android and iOS store).

CBS 2's Marissa Parra spoke to a healthcare worker on the frontlines with the answers on why the flu has so far been a no-show so far. For almost an entire year, coronavirus has been the focus of attention, but noticeably absent, despite earlier warnings, is the flu. Many doctors and public health experts in 2020 expressed fears of a so-called "twindemic" – fearing a surge of COVID-19 cases could hit at the same time as a flu outbreak, but Dr. Lisa Ravindra, a primary care doctor with Rush University Medical Center, said "the flu has been really unusual this year." "We haven't seen any cases of the flu in my office," she said. As a primary care physician, Ravindra has had a lot of one-on-one time with influenza in past flu seasons. "My schedule would be comprised of maybe a third of patients with cough/cold flu-like symptoms," she said. This year the flu has been a no-show. Take a look at the chart below from the Chicago Department of Public Health. The grey bars show weekly influenza hospitalizations from the 2019-20 flu season. The blue bars show weekly hospitalizations this flu season. (Source: Chicago Department of Public Health) Compare that with what the same chart looked like from CDPH in January 2020, just weeks before coronavirus arrived. Weekly flu hospitalizations in December 2019 and early January 2020 outpaced hospitalizations one year earlier. (Source: Chicago Department of Public Health) The measures we're taking to slow the spread of coronavirus are also slowing the spread of the flu; social distancing, wearing masks, limiting travel, and staying home more by working and learning remotely. Ravindra said, unlike COVID-19, which doesn't seem to spread easily through children, the same doesn't go for influenza. "Children have been carriers of the flu, or can spread the flu very easily," she said. Also keep in mind that, among adults, COVID-19 is just more contagious. Part of that is because of how long it takes for symptoms to show up. With COVID-19, it can take up to 14 days, but with influenza it can take only 1 or 2; and you're more likely to stay away from people when you're feeling sick. There's one more factor in the lack of flu cases. Fears of getting COVID and the flu at the same time had people rushing to the pharmacist. "I think that that encouraged people to get the flu vaccine. So in the U.S., we've vaccinated more people than ever before for the flu," Ravindra said. The CDC said, as of Dec. 25, 2020, more than 192 million doses of flu vaccine had been distributed, a record high for the U.S. in a single flu season, which typically runs from October through May. If you haven't gotten a flu shot yet, doctors say it's not too late.

Its silvery-green waters, verdant forests, shrubbery islands, grassy swamps and aquatic life make the reservoir a paradise for migratory birds.But this winter, for the first time in recent decades, birds in the 307-square km Pong wetlands are hit by avian influenza H5N1. And the worst affected species is one of the world's highest-altitude fliers, the bar-headed goose, an endangered species that regularly descend in India.The Pong wetlands, one of the largest man-made wetlands in northern India, have emerged as the preferred wintering ground of the bar-headed goose. At the annual waterfowl estimation coordinated by the state wildlife wing in 2015, a staggering 71,800 bar-headed geese, probably half their numbers globally, were recorded in the Pong wetlands, an all-time high till date.A total of 49,496 bar-headed geese were recorded in January 2020. Around 23,000 and 28,160 geese were recorded in 2009 and 2008, respectively. The gregarious goose feeds at night in the grasslands on riverbanks and breeds in high-altitude lakes in Central Asia, including Tibet and Ladakh.With the death toll of migratory waterbirds in the Pong wetlands rising to 4,020, and almost 90 per cent of them being notable visitors, the bar-headed goose, the state wildlife authorities blamed avian influenza (H5N1) for the disaster.Principal Chief Conservator Forest, Wildlife, Archana Sharma, told IANS that 318 dead birds were found in the Pong catchment on Saturday and with them, the total number of mortality of birds rose to 4,020. She said the ICAR-National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) based in Bhopal has confirmed that the avian influenza virus (H5N1) was responsible for their mortality.The first death was reported on December 28 last year. However, Pong heaved a sigh of relief as fatality cases are falling now."Most of the carcasses that were collected in the past two-three days were of those who died quite a long time back and they were retrieved from dense forest and muddy terrain," she said."The decayed carcasses indicate that the mortality has declined," Sharma said.But wildlife experts are concerned over a large number of species that have started migrating from Pong to nearby wetlands, lakes and water bodies owing to stress and trauma by seeing influenza-hit birds dying and behaving unnaturally. Some birds—including the bar-headed geese—were seen acting strangely before their deaths, Chief Conservator Wildlife (Pong wetlands) Upasna Patyal, told IANS."When you're seeing that birds are not able to take the flight despite healthy wings, it's really disturbing. At some distance, you find their carcasses," she said. Besides the bar-headed goose, the other species that died owing to the influenza were the shoveler, the river tern, the black-headed gull and the common teal.The dead included a lesser white-fronted goose that was visiting the Pong wetlands alone for the past three years. Crossing national and international boundaries, millions of migratory birds of several species descend on various water bodies and wetlands in the region. They start returning by the end of February or the beginning of March.AdvertisementAt the last waterfowl estimation conducted in Pong on December 15, nearly 57,000 waterbirds were recorded that comprised 27,000 bar-headed geese."Our current estimation indicates the presence of a small population of migratory birds in Pong of all prominent species as most of them have moved to nearby water bodies possibly due to psychological stress," a wildlife official, who didn't wish to be identified, told IANS.He said it is still doubtful that the birds infected with H5N1 are able or willing to embark on long-distance migration. "This needs further surveillance, at least months, as there are chances of the presence of the virus in nature. This disaster may also cause stopping of the arrival of the bar-headed goose for some years. For this, we need drastic habitat restoration too."Listed under Schedule IV of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, the global population of the bar-headed geese, known for two distinctive black bars across their neck, is believed to be around 130,000, wildlife experts say.Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) Deputy Director S. Balachandran, who was earlier tracking migratory routes of the geese and duck species through satellite and leg-rings in Pong, told IANS over the phone that Pong is the only wintering ground in the globe to hold such a large congregation of bar-headed geese."Most of the water bodies and lakes across the country have been getting bar-headed geese every winter. Their number is between 3,000 and 4,000 in each water body. But Pong is the only place which is getting the largest influx of bar-headed geese, largely from Tibet and Ladakh," he said. Even their breeding grounds spread over Tibetan plateau do not support such a large number of the geese at one point in time, he added.Besides the bar-headed goose, other prominent species that regularly descend on Pong, some 250 km from Himachal Pradesh capital Shimla and 190 km from Chandigarh, are the coot, common pochard, red-crested pochard, great cormorant, gadwall, northern pintail, river tern and the spotbill duck.Other species recorded are the common shelduck, the greater white-fronted goose, the black-bellied tern, the Sarus crane, the lesser white-fronted goose, the osprey, the buff bellied pipit and water rail. These species are not common visitors in other wetlands in India. In Pong, the influx of the bar-headed geese can be spotted in marshy areas along the reservoir like Nagrota Suriyan, Nandpur Batoli, Chatta, Jambal and the Rancer island, say wildlife officials.The Pong wetlands are also home to many native birds like the red jungle fowl, large Indian parakeet, Indian cuckoo, bank mynah, wood shrike, yellow-eyed babbler, black ibis, paradise flycatcher, crested lark and the crested bunting.A total of 425 birds species—both migratory and local—18 snake species, 90 butterfly species, 24 mammal species and 27 of fish have been recorded so far in Pong.**The above article has been published from a wire agency with minimal modifications to the headline and text.

Demonstrators arrive for a protest against the state's flu vaccine mandate for students last week outside the Massachusetts State House in Boston. Craig F. Walker / The Boston Globe By Nik DeCosta-Klipa January 15, 2021 FacebookTwitterEmailEmail2 Less than a month after extending the deadline to comply, Massachusetts is now dropping its statewide flu vaccine requirement for students. The state’s Department of Public Health said Friday afternoon that it is removing the vaccination requirement — which applied to all children over the age of 6 months attending Massachusetts child care, pre-school, kindergarten, K-12, or college — due to the “mild” flu season and the fledgling efforts to administer the COVID-19 vaccine. “Preliminary data show that this has been a mild flu season to date, presumably as people have received their seasonal flu vaccine and have been adhering to mask-wearing and social distancing due to COVID-19,” DPH said in a statement. “Given the intensive Commonwealth-wide efforts regarding COVID-19 vaccination, DPH wants to alleviate the burden to obtain flu vaccination and focus on continuing our COVID-19 vaccination efforts.” Advertisement: Massachusetts became the only state in the country to impose the flu vaccine requirement back in August, due to concerns that the traditional influenza season coinciding with the second COVID-19 surge could overwhelm hospitals. However, while the coronavirus has indeed seen a significant resurgence through the fall and winter, health experts have said that business restrictions and social distancing due to COVID-19 has suppressed the transmission of other less-contagious respiratory diseases. The state set a Dec. 31 deadline for students to get the flu vaccine, but extended it last month until Feb. 28, before dropping it Friday. The mandate had also incited some small but passionate protests from some parents and activists. Advertisement: Though no longer required, DPH officials say they continue to “strongly recommend” that everyone over the age of six months receive a seasonal flu vaccine each year. Experts worry that the mild flu season could spell a rebound in flu cases later on (that exact situation already appears to be playing out in Australia, as The Washington Post reported Tuesday) “Because we have not been exposed to them as much this year, they may take their toll next year,” Dr. Katherine Gergen Barnett, program director of Boston Medical Center’s Department of Family Medicine, told NBC Boston earlier this week.

How to Handle Raw Meat?Amid bird flu scare, here are some tips to handle raw chicken before you cook it.The QuintUpdated: 20 Feb 2023, 11:30 AM ISTF.A.QAaAaSmallAaMediumAaLargeVideo Editor: Deepthi RamdasCamera: Athar RatherProducer: Mythreyee RameshThe H5N1 influenza – commonly referred to as the bird flu – is now being 'closely monitored' scientists and the World Health Organisation (WHO), after its spread to mammals.At least 58 million poultry birds have died due to the virus over the past few weeks, along with hundreds of wild sea lions in South America, a farm of minks in Europe.Can bird flu spread through meat consumption? How should you handle raw chicken?The Quint breaks down these questions for you.ADVERTISEMENTREMOVE ADCan avian influenza spread from birds to human beings?To put it straight, the flu primarily affects birds. However, those human beings who come in direct contact with sick birds may get infected. There is no need to panic as human to human spread is not too prominent with the current strain.“People who work closely with poultry are at high risk of getting an infection. Otherwise, human to human transmission of the H5N1 virus is very rare.” Dr Harshal R Salve, Associate Professor at Centre for Community Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), to IANSDoes this mean I should not eat eggs, chicken or duck?Till date, no evidence indicates that anyone has become infected following the consumption of properly cooked poultry or poultry products, even when these foods were contaminated with the avian influenza virus, the Centre has said in its revised Action Plan for Prevention, Control & Containment of Avian Influenza.The World Health Organisation (WHO) has maintained that it is ‘safe’ to eat chicken and eggs as long as it is ‘properly prepared and cooked’.“As a standard precaution, WHO recommends that poultry, poultry products, and wild game birds should always be prepared following good hygienic practices and that poultry meat should be properly cooked,” the body adds.Also ReadBird Flu Resurgence in France and the US: What Is Avian Virus? What Do We Know?Does heat kill the virus causing bird flu?Yes, most definitely.Dr Praveen Gupta, Director and Head Neurology, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, Gurgaon, told FIT, “Yes, cooking at 70ºC keeps food safe and ensures that the virus is killed.”“It must be emphasised that poultry meat cooked at more than 70ºC temperature for 30 minutes inactivates the virus, and it is absolutely safe to consume properly cooked poultry meat and eggs,” the Centre too has noted.Is there any specific precaution I should take if I buy meat directly from a butcher stop?According to Nishanth Chandran, Founder-CEO of online meat shop TenderCuts, the following precautions should be taken while buying meat directly from a butcher shop:Take your own stainless steel vessel and collect the meat in the sameAvoid using a plastic bag to pack the meat at the shopWhen you reach home, clean the chicken immediatelyHowever, one should avoid going to markets that sell poultry, experts tell.“One should avoid going to open markets that sell poultry as they are the focal point of the spread,” Richa Sareen, consultant (pulmonology), at Fortis Vasant Kunj in New Delhi, told IANS.She also suggested avoiding any visit to live animal markets or poultry farms for now. “If need be, wear a mask and gloves all the time. Also, do not go near or touch bird droppings or sick and dead birds.”Also ReadMaharashtra, Delhi Confirm Bird Flu: How Are States Tackling It?ADVERTISEMENTREMOVE ADWhat precautions should I take while handling raw meat?Chandran advised people to undertake the following measures before cooking raw poultry.Wash/sanitise your hands with warm water and soapDo not wash the meat under running tap waterThe chances of contaminating the meat is more when washed with unclean waterUse RO water to clean the meatIf you don't have access to RO water, boil water and let it cool down and then wash the meatYou can then marinate or cook the meatDr Upali Nanda, Head, Preventive Health & Consultant-Medicine, Medeor Hospital Qutab Institutional Area (Delhi), too, advised that one should wash their hands with warm water and use different utensils for cooking meat.“Wash your hands with warm water and soap, especially before and after handling the raw poultry and eggs. Use different utensils for cooking raw meat and make sure meat is cooked properly until steaming hot. Avoid direct contact with live and poultry birds.”How long can I store meat after I clean it further?While it is advisable to cook the meat immediately but you may store it for 24 hours after cleaning the meat.ADVERTISEMENTREMOVE ADWhat precautions should be taken while cooking?Cook meat/eggs at or above 70ºC to make sure that the virus is killedConsumers need to be sure that all parts of the poultry are fully cooked – that there is no “pink” parts and no runny yolks in eggsIn areas experiencing outbreaks in poultry, raw eggs should not be used in foods that will not be further heat-treatedIf chicken is going to be boiled for a salad dressing, make sure that the chicken is cooked completely and does not remain raw(With inputs from FIT.

But while the Black Death triggered a systematic decline in wealth inequality in medieval Europe, the Spanish flu of 1918-19 led to rises in both poverty and income inequality.Many fear that Covid-19 might lead to increases in poverty and economic inequality. At the same time, some draw on the historical experience of the Black Death in the fourteenth century to argue that major pandemics can instead lead to less unequal societies. But subsequent plagues and other epidemics have failed to produce these effects – and when they did manage to reduce the extent of poverty, it was usually due more to mass mortality among the poorest and most fragile than to redistribution. In the case of the most recent of the worst pandemics in history – the influenza pandemic of 1918-19 commonly known as the Spanish flu, which is also the one closest to Covid-19 from an epidemiological point of view – there is evidence that it fostered an increase in both inequality and poverty. This is the scenario that we must be prepared to face today.Do we have evidence that a major pandemic can reduce inequality?The Black Death of 1347-52 was the worst pandemic in European history in terms of overall mortality rates: it killed about half the population of the continent and of the broader Mediterranean area. We now have quite solid evidence that it led to a reduction in both income and wealth inequality (Alfani, 2020). This is particularly clear when considering wealth, for which we have relatively abundant data.As Figure 1 shows, the Black Death triggered one of only two phases of systematic decline in European wealth inequality to be found during the last seven centuries. The second phase occurred in the twentieth century and is associated with the two world wars (see Piketty, 2014).A brief account of these long-term tendencies in inequality is provided by this short video produced by the EINITE project (‘Economic inequality in pre-industrial Europe’). Based on this kind of evidence, it has been argued that throughout human history, only catastrophes have managed to lead to a substantial reduction in inequality (Scheidel, 2017), although this remains debated.Based on Figure 1, in the aftermath of the Black Death, the richest 10% of the population lost their grip on between 15% and 20% of overall wealth. There were two main causes for this.First, in the years following the pandemic, labour became scarce and real wages increased (which is indicative of a reduction in income inequality). More generally, the poorest strata of society enjoyed a boost to their bargaining power: they were able to negotiate better conditions and managed to acquire some property, often for the first time.Second, extremely high mortality in the context of the partible inheritance system, which characterised many areas of Medieval Europe, led to the fragmentation of large patrimonies as estates were shared with all children rather than going just to the oldest one. This led many people to inherit properties that they did not need or want and, consequently, to an unusual abundance of property being offered on the market, which favoured a further reduction in wealth inequality. Figure 1: The share of wealth of the richest 10% in Europe, 1300-2010 Source: Alfani, 2017But did all major pandemics reduce inequality?The conditions prevailing at the time of the Black Death, which led to a decline in inequality, were not to be repeated in later plagues, even major ones like those that affected southern European countries during the seventeenth century and led to mortality rates comparable to the Black Death. For example, the 1630 plague, which killed about 35% of the population of northern Italy, produced an extremely limited and short-lived reduction in inequality, almost undetectable based on the available historical documentation.This is because of the very different institutional framework in place at the onset of the pandemic. After the Black Death, when it had become clear that plague was to remain a recurrent scourge, the richest families began to protect their patrimonies from unwanted fragmentation by using specific institutions, like the fideicommissum which guaranteed that a well-defined set of family properties were transferred unaltered and undivided from one generation to the next. This interrupted one of the key mechanisms through which plague might have reduced wealth inequality. But there is more: after the seventeenth century plagues, we see no trace of an increase in real wages, either in Italy or in other severely affected European areas (compare Panel A and B in Figure 2). Consequently, we have no reason to think that the poorest strata of society experienced a significant improvement in their relative income or wealth (Alfani, 2020).The bottom line here is that we need to be very cautious when generalising from historical evidence related to specific episodes, including important and much-researched ones like the Black Death. Things become even more complicated if we look deeper into how major pandemics can reduce the extent of poverty, and if we look at pathogens with different epidemiological characteristics.Figure 2: Real wages of unskilled workers in European cities, 1300-1400 and 1600-1700 compared (in grams of silver)Source: Alfani, 2020bWhat about the poor?Although major pre-industrial epidemics did not always reduce overall inequality in a significant way, they usually had a visible impact on poverty. After the Black Death, poverty was reduced mostly because of redistribution towards the poor, a process fuelled by labourers’ stronger bargaining position and other factors. This can be seen in Figure 3 for England: the percentage of households with income insufficient to acquire a ‘respectability basket’ of goods declined from 41% in 1290 to 22% in 1381.But in subsequent episodes, and especially when overall income and wealth inequality did not decline significantly, there is evidence that a much darker mechanism was at play to reduce poverty: the simple and brutal extermination of the poor. In the case of plague, it is well-known that from the late fifteenth century, it started to be considered a disease typical of the poor (Cohn, 2009), who consequently were expelled from cities or interned in specific institutions at the first suspicion of infection, a policy that seems to have further increased the death toll among the most economically and socially vulnerable strata.Something similar happened during the cholera pandemics of the nineteenth century. Because the spread of cholera is accelerated by unhealthy and crowded living conditions, the disease affected the poorest groups much worse than all other strata, especially in cities. Thus, it tended to curtail the lower part of the distribution, which would have led to a reduction in inequality among the survivors even in the absence of any other distributive effect. In other words, inequality declined because the poorest died, not because wealth or income came to be more evenly distributed (Alfani, 2020).Figure 3. Prevalence of poverty in England, 1290-1801/03 (percentage of households with income insufficient for having access to a ‘respectability basket’) Source: Alfani, 2020c based on data from Broadberry et al, 2015Did the Spanish flu increase inequality?Together, the cases of cholera and plague allow us to highlight an important point: apart from the initial conditions, overall mortality rates and the structure of mortality also play a crucial role in determining the redistributive effects of an epidemic. This implies that the epidemiological characteristics of an infection shape its impact on inequality and poverty.The Spanish flu of 1918-19 is usually taken as the worst-case scenario for a pandemic that is caused by a highly diffusible pathogen, which can infect a very large proportion of the overall population, but which does not have such a high case fatality rate – which is the case for Covid-19 too. Although the Spanish flu killed between 2.5% and 5% of the world population (50 to 100 million victims), the case fatality rate was quite low.The horrific number of victims of the Spanish flu resulted from its ability to spread very efficiently. According to one estimate, it might have infected one-third of the world’s population. This proved crucial in determining its distributive impact: compared with major plagues, the Spanish flu did not cause a large contraction of the labour force. In other words, mortality was not high enough to lead to an improvement in the relative position of labourers – nor was it large enough to reduce inequality through extermination of the poor.Instead, the pandemic tended to damage the incomes of the poorest and most fragile strata of society comparatively more. This is because in a pandemic that infects a very large proportion of the population (but does not usually kill them), those who need healthy conditions for physical work will also lose a larger part of their overall income.Recent research suggests that the 1918-19 pandemic led to increases in income inequality (for example, in Italy – see Galletta and Giommoni, 2020) for the reasons mentioned above as well as the spread of unemployment caused by the economic crisis brought about by the disease. The most striking evidence is for Sweden, where for every death caused by influenza, there were four new poor people who had to ask for public help at poorhouses (Karlsson et al, 2014). What are the lessons from history?The historical evidence suggests that the effects that a pandemic can have on inequality and poverty depend on the conditions in place at the beginning of the crisis, including the institutional framework, as well as the epidemiological characteristics of the pathogen involved. As a consequence, we must be very careful to avoid undue generalisations from past episodes.That being said, the case closest to Covid-19 – both chronologically and even more clearly from an epidemiological point of view – is that of the Spanish flu of 1918-19. The early twentieth century pandemic led to increases in both poverty and income inequality – and it seems probable that Covid-19 will tend to produce the same effects.During the current crisis, much concern has already been expressed about rapidly growing unemployment, especially among the poorest – not only due to the pandemic itself (think about job losses for infected people or those who will long suffer poor health as a consequence of the infection), but also as a result of the containment policies (such as lockdowns of various kinds) that have been applied worldwide (OECD, 2020). Governments need to be prepared to manage, and possibly to prevent, the social crisis that seems sure to follow the current health crisis.Where can I find out more?Epidemics, inequality and poverty in preindustrial and early industrial times: Guido Alfani provides an updated overview of recent research on the distributive effects of past pandemics and epidemics.

Jonathan Walford from the Fashion History Museum in Hespeler takes a look at how clothing trends shifted after the Spanish Flu in 1918 and evaluates if something similar could happen now.'People were tired of dying, they wanted to live instead,' says Jonathan WalfordCBC News · Posted: Jan 16, 2021 1:05 PM EST | Last Updated: January 16, 2021A fashionable woman posing with a cigarette holder. The First World War and the Spanish Flu spurred what we now know as the Roaring 20s — a time of fashion and frivolity after a decade of difficulty. (General Photographic Agency/Getty Images)Social SharingWith so many people working from home, 2020 wasn't the most fashionable year.A lot of us got accustomed to joggers and oversized sweaters. Others, craving an opportunity to dress up and go out, put on a nice outfit just to go on a grocery run. With retail stores closed to all but curbside pickup for Ontario's second lockdown in less than a year, the pandemic has even affected the way we access the fashion industry.As director curator of the Fashion History Museum in Cambridge, Jonathan Walford has been watching the developments closely.He shared his observations with The Morning Edition's host Craig Norris. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.Craig Norris: We've been in a global pandemic since March. What has happened to the fashion industry and trends in the past nine to 10 months?Jonathan Walford: It's a weird time because everything has happened and nothing has happened. So it depends which way you want to look at it. Style-wise, there really hasn't been an awful lot to change because there hasn't been an audience out there to change it. One part of fashion which has done extremely well is athleisure. So if you worried about yoga pants or leggings or anything like that — they're going to be around, they're doing just fine, there's no problem there at all.But any sort of dress-up fashion, high fashion has stagnated. It hasn't really gone anywhere at all, because there hasn't been anyone to wear it. Some companies have even saved their spring wardrobe from last year and they're going to be re-introducing it this year. So it's literally going to be the same clothes this year as last year.So in that case, there has been very little change. However, there's been massive change — decades worth of change happening behind the scenes and how we buy our clothes, how those are being made, that kind of thing. That whole part of the industry has shifted dramatically. CN: So maybe the fashion trends we're going to see in 2021 will be part what we wear, and part how what we wear is made and distributed? JW: Exactly. We're not going to brick and mortar stores anymore, and the department store is dying on its feet; we're worried about what the few that are left it's all going to be online purchasing — that's going to be the main source of us buying clothes in the near future. circa 1925: Two fashionable young women at a public event. (Hulton Archive/Getty Images)CN: What role has this pandemic played in influencing the trends you think we're going to see?JW: It's hard to say because we're still in the middle of it, so I think in many ways we won't know what's going to happen for another year or two but a lot of people think we're going to become even more casual — I can't imagine how that's even possible.Then other people think we're going to snap to the other side, going to become very fashionable and things are going to come from far more glamorous than they had been beforehand.I think both will happen, because the one thing that's happening at the same time as COVID, and COVID is not the only thing that is influencing fashion, there's all sorts of things happening at the same time.One of the things happening is there's now an acceptance — we're becoming more inclusive. And that doesn't mean just with Black Lives Matter, that means with all forms of society. So, I think there's more awareness and acceptance of the individual. And that means that probably in a year or two from now, you can probably go to work in sweatpants or in full drag and either way will be completely acceptable. How the modern flapper gal of the 1920s spurred moral panic in CanadaCN: After the pandemic 100 years ago, fashion really took off. How does that compare to what you think we'll see? JW: A lot of what I'm basing my thoughts on are based on exactly what happened 100 years ago.Again, in the period that the Spanish influenza came about was a difficult era. There was women's liberation happening at the time — when they were getting the vote for the first time — there was the whole post-World War I, you know, trying to recreate an economy again. That was an issue because there are so many people unemployed because the munitions factories stopped making munitions, that kind of thing.So it was a new world and there was a lot to adapt to very quickly after the First World War and the Spanish Influenza just kind of landed right in the middle of it. So fashion then was also stagnated between about 1918 and 1921. The fashion had very little change — there's about three or four years there when it's kind of hard to tell which year is which because tiny little things happened, but nothing major at all. The Roaring Twenties, I think was a reaction, partly to the Spanish influenza, but also to the First World War. People were tired of dying, they wanted to live instead.Created during Spanish flu, jingle dress dance now helping First Nations people cope with COVID-19So I think we're going to see a lot of tourism and that kind of thing. People are going to want to get out of the house — something they haven't been able to do for a while now. So we'll probably see clothes related to that, making a big influence in future fashion. CN: With people moving to shopping more online, what does this mean for the environmentally-friendly fashion industry in 2021? JW: That was something was already in the works before this came along and is something that's pushing faster now.A lot of people are predicting that fast fashion is going to come to an end. We're going to be buying fewer clothes, better quality. We're certainly going to be worried more now about the dyes that that are poisoning the lakes and the cotton which is drying up the plains and things like that.So there's going to be more awareness of that, and there already is more awareness of that. It's building steam and is getting bigger and bigger.A ladies walking suit from 1918.

Here’s What WHO Says With more states confirming cases of Avian Influenza, aka bird flu, we ask experts — is it safe to consume chicken and eggs at this time? By Roshini Muthukumar January 12, 2021 With 10 states, including Kerala, Maharashtra and Himachal Pradesh confirming cases of Avian Influenza or bird flu, the government is on high alert and the surveillance in poultry farms, live bird markets, and zoos have been increased. Though the flu primarily affects birds, it can infect humans who come in close contact with the sick birds. What is bird flu? According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), bird flu is a type of influenza virus (H5N1 virus) which causes severe respiratory diseases in birds and can spread to humans. But it is difficult for this virus to transmit from one person to the next. Advertisement With reports of poultry culling owing to the flu, and a major price drop in the price of poultry in some regions, concerns have been raised over the consumption of chicken and eggs at this time. Is it safe to consume chicken and eggs at this time? Yes, it is safe to consume poultry meat and eggs. According to the WHO official site, there is no epidemiological data which suggests that the disease can be transmitted to humans through cooked food (even if the bird was contaminated with the virus before cooking). However, a few cases have been linked to consumption of undercooked contaminated poultry that had traces of blood. Advertisement WHO mentions that it is safe to consume cooked poultry and eggs because the virus is heat sensitive and when the food reaches 70-degree celsius in all parts, the pathogens cannot survive. The website states that a large number of human infections with the H5N1 virus have been linked to slaughter practises undertaken at home that leads to the handling of the dead birds before cooking. It suggests avoiding these practises completely and washing hands with soap and water after handling raw poultry meat. Dr Raja Selvarajan, a General Physician at Corona Health Care clinic in Bengaluru also says that it is safe to consume poultry and eggs as long as it is thoroughly cooked. Advertisement He says, “As a precautionary measure, it is advisable to avoid cooking poultry and eggs in the microwave. Use only stove-top methods to ensure that the food is cooked to at least 100-degree celsius.” (Edited by Yoshita Rao) Advertisement Join The Better India Community Be part of a vibrant community focused on making a positive impact.

Here's what experts say Bird Flu: Safe to eat chicken, egg? Here's what experts say Contrary to what some people think that the bird flu virus, also known as Avian influenza, is spread to humans via consumption of cooked poultry products, health experts on Sunday stressed that it usually does not infect people as the virus is heat-labile (degraded and killed when subjected to heat). Reported by: IANS New Delhi Updated on: January 10, 2021 13:42 IST URL copied Follow us on Image Source : INDIA TV Bird flu virus is heat-labile, gets killed at 'cooking temperature' Contrary to what some people think that the bird flu virus, also known as Avian influenza, is spread to humans via consumption of cooked poultry products, health experts on Sunday stressed that it usually does not infect people as the virus is heat-labile (degraded and killed when subjected to heat). Avian influenza refers to the disease caused by infection with avian (bird) influenza (flu) Type A viruses. These viruses occur naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species. According to the World Health organisation (WHO), cooking of poultry (e.g. chicken, ducks and geese) at or above 70 degree Celsius so that absolutely no meat remains raw and red, is a safe measure to kill the virus in areas with outbreaks in poultry. Richa Sareen, consultant (pulmonology) at Fortis Vasant Kunj in New Delhi, said the virus is heat-labile and it gets killed with cooking temperatures. "At this time, people should eat fully cooked chicken and eggs and not raw or partially cooked ones. One should avoid going to open markets that sell poultry as they are the focal point of the spread," Sareen told IANS. "People who handle poultry should take special precautions. They should wear PPE, gloves and masks while handling birds and should practice frequent hand washing," she added. Although the virus causing bird flu usually does not infect people, but rare cases of human infection with these viruses have been reported, especially in individuals working with infected domestic birds. "The possible cause of infections in humans is when they come in contact with birds with the viruses and enough viruses get into a person's eyes, nose or mouth, or is inhaled through the excretions of birds," said Kunal Kothari, Senior Physician, Internal Medicine, SMS Medical College in Jaipur. "The spread of Bird Flu from one individual, who is sick to another has been very rare and data is limited, inefficient and not sustained but as a precaution, we should all be watchful of public health advisory," Kothari added. Bird Flu is a communicable virus among the avian population and human to human spread is not too prominent with the current strain. However, viruses are prone to mutation, so if this virus undergoes mutation in future, it has the potential to spread from human to human and cause a pandemic. Bird flu mostly infects the respiratory system of humans. Common symptoms are fever, runny nose, sore throat, cough, muscle aches, etc. "If severe, it can cause ARDS, multi-organ involvement and even death. The sporadic data on bird flu from the past shows very high mortality, to the tune of 60 per cent. Thus, it becomes important to take precautions now," Sareen mentioned. Nevertheless, maintaining distance from birds in the environment is important as the spread of the avian virus is through the saliva, faecal matter of an infected bird. "The avian virus is airborne. Notify the community health department on seeing sick or dead birds and try not to come in direct contact with these birds without proper masks, gloves and disinfectants," Kothari noted. The Central government has issued a status report of avian influenza in the country, saying the disease has been confirmed in seven states. The Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying (DAHD) has issued an advisory to the affected states so as to avoid further spread of disease.

Photo: Information and public relations department, Government of Kerala K A ShajiPublished on: 15 Jan 2021, 9:36 amCopiedLivestock owners did report warning signs about the bird flu epidemic that started in central Kerala around New Year’s Eve but the lack of a testing facility in the state meant that precious time may have lost in confirmation of the malaise, according to farmers.Farms in the region had started witnessing symptoms of the H5N8 strain of the disease from December 19, 2020 according to V J Sebastian, a duck farmer from the village of Karuvatta in Alappuzha district, the epicentre of the outbreak. By December 21, deaths had been reported from farms.Sebastian said ducks were seen falling unconscious and dying after a few hours.“The farmers had apprised the administration as soon as the birds started to show symptoms of the disease. However, it took around two weeks to confirm avian influenza. The state urgently requires its facilities to test and confirm bird flu incidents,” B Rajasekharan, Alappuzha district president of Kerala Duck Farmers’ Association told this reporter.That is true. All tests and confirmations were from the National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) at Bhopal.Kerala lacks any facility to identify the disease on time. It has no well-equipped laboratory to ascertain the reasons quickly. Reports get delayed for many days since other states are also dependent on NIHSAD.PK Santhosh Kumar, joint director of the Kerala Animal Husbandry Department in charge of Alappuzha, said the department had no clue as to which migratory bird had spread the disease this time. No dead migratory bird had been seen in the affected localities so far, he said.Forest department officials said they had just started efforts to collect samples of migratory birds to facilitate their tests. The Vembanad lake in Alappuzha is visited by several migratory birds including Siberian cranes, various species of herons, darters, bitterns, Brahminy kites, marsh harriers, teals, larks and flycatchers.The department had started efforts to gather more information on virus-carrying migratory birds with the forest department’s help, Kumar added.Kumar said no vaccine effective in countering variations of the avian influenza was available. “The farmers are rearing ducks scientifically here according to our guidelines. Other than culling and disinfecting the farms, we have no other way to fight the disease,” he said.According to Kumar, the duck farms of Kuttanad had reported numerous cases of fowl cholera caused by Pasteurella multocida and infection of Riemerella anatipestifer, an antibiotic-resistant bacteria.“The immunity level of ducks in the region has decreased due to the fowl cholera and Riemerella. So it would be easy for the avian flu virus to attack the ducks. We are searching for expert help to improve immunity levels of ducks in Kuttanad,” he said.Complete disasterThe bird flu epidemic has wrought havoc in Kerala’s scenic Kuttanad region located in Alappuzha.The influenza outbreak was confined to the villages of Pallippad, Nedumudy, Thakazhy and Karuvatta, forming part of Kuttanad, the palm-fringed emerald islets of Alappuzha district that are surrounded by vast expanses of backwaters.Waterlogged Kuttanad is spread over approximately 110,000 hectares. Of this, 50,000 hectares are 60-220 centimetres below sea level. For tourists, it is the hub of Kerala’s backwater tourism experience. For farmers, it is one of the areas where farming is conducted below sea level.Over 1.8 million people live in Kuttanad and most of them have been rearing ducks for generations. The low-lying paddy fields and backwater expanses of Kuttanad are conducive for rearing ducks.This New Year’s Eve though, disaster struck.By the evening of December 31, 2020, 69-year-old K Samuel from Pallippad village had lost 5,264 ducks to the flu outbreak. On New Year’s Day, the administration culled the remaining 2,806 ducks on his farm as a preventive measure.A farmer who is also engaged in paddy cultivation and aquaculture, Samuel estimates his losses at Rs 10 lakh. However, the district administration informed him January 11 that he would get compensation worth around Rs 4 lakh.According to the state government policy announced January 6, the compensation for a duck older than two months would be Rs 200. Compensation for birds below this age would be Rs 100.“This is very meagre. The government claims the state has already brought influenza under control and farmers can resume farm activities by buying fresh hatchlings from outside,” Samuel told this reporter.“But how can I rebuild my lost livelihood using the meagre compensation they have offered? In the last few years, the feed price and labour costs have increased manifold. I am now weighing my options about whether to resume or abandon duck farming forever,” he added.Samuel’s family is among over 1,200 duck farming families in Kuttanad, who have been affected.As many as 28,000 ducks perished in Kuttanad in the last two weeks solely due to the outbreak, according to the Kerala Animal Husbandry Department’s Alappuzha district office,The department has culled 34,602 ducks to check the spread of the disease to other parts. Governmental agencies have also destroyed 32,550 eggs and 5,070 kg of feed.A strict ban on selling eggs and meat of ducks and chicken is still in force in Kuttanad.“We are sad that the compensation announced this time by the state government is the same as what was fixed in 2014 when the flu was reported for the first time in the district. Seven years have passed and the cost of production has increased significantly. The government is duty-bound to increase the compensation,” he said.The amount should be enhanced to Rs 250 for a duck older than two months and Rs 150 for the smaller one. There also must be a considerable subsidy for duck feed.Though the authorities say the crisis is over, nobody is purchasing ducks and eggs from farms in the district not affected by the epidemic. They too have landed in trouble.Alappuzha in general and Kuttanad, in particular, have witnessed bird flu outbreaks in 2014 and 2016. The floods of 2018 and 2019 and recurring bacterial infections have already made everyday life miserable here, along with the novel coronavirus disease pandemic.“The bird flu outbreak is the latest entrant. Virus outbreaks, bacterial infections and floods had already made the survival of this sector extremely difficult. Several duck farmers of the region have already shifted to other jobs because of the unexpected turns of events,” said Rajasekharan.IndiaAgricultureKeralaAvian Flubird fluAvian flu outbreakAvian influenzaBird cullingPoultryAlappuzha (D)Show CommentsRelated StoriesNo stories found.

Written by FE Online Updated: January 14, 2021 16:42 IST Follow Us Officials said situation is being strictly monitored and samples are being tested regularly. (Photo source: IE) Avian influenza: Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday directed officials to withdraw orders to restrict trade and import of chicken and allow poultry markets to open after samples taken from there were tested negative for bird flu.As many as 100 samples were taken from Ghazipur – Asia’s largest poultry market. Around 70 per cent of the total supply of poultry products in Delhi is provided by the Ghazipur market. The market is situated on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border.

Follow us on Google NewsCan chicken curry give you the bird flu? Dr Mayur Dangar, who is in-charge of Mumbai’s animal and bird hospital, Bombay Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (BSPCA), said that it’s likely not. He said cooking it on high heat can help kill the virus.Dangar said that a combination of India spices and cooking the meat in over 70 degree Celcius of heat is effective in killing avian influenza that causes bird flu. However, Dr Dangar warned that those who handle poultry must remain extra cautious.“People who handle poultry should take special precautions.The possible cause of infections in humans is when they come in contact with birds with the virus. It can get into a person’s eyes, nose or mouth, or is inhaled through the excretions of the birds," Dangar said.Also read: Bird Flu Scare: Sale and Storage of Poultry and Processed Chicken Banned in Parts of DelhiAccording to health experts, even well cooked eggs won’t give you the bird flu. While half-cooked egg preparations like the sunny side up’ can get you infected, but not a hard-boiled egg. According to the World Health organisation (WHO), poultry (e.g. chicken, ducks and geese) should be cooked at or above 70 degree Celsius so that absolutely no part of the meat remains raw and red. This is a safe measure to kill the virus in areas with outbreaks in poultry.“Most strains of avian influenza virus are mainly found in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of infected birds, and not in meat. However, highly pathogenic viruses, such as the H5N1 strain, spread to virtually all parts of an infected bird, including meat. Proper cooking at temperatures at or above 70°C in all parts of the product will inactivate the virus," WHO guidelines say.Also read:Bird Flu Growing Concern in Gujarat as Cases Detected in Various DistrictsUsually, in India, chicken is marinated in several spices like black paper, cinnamon and cloves and along with ginger and garlic.Ginger has antiviral, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties and studies suggest it can be effective against avian influenza, RSV, and feline calicivirus.Indian cuisine uses spices — like coriander, turmeric, cinnamon, cumin, clove — that are known to provide relief from symptoms of several ailments.

Trending Bird Flu Scare: Chicken Sales Banned In Parts of Delhi Stuti Verma 3527 After the confirmation of bird flu cases in Delhi on Monday, the Delhi Municipal Corporations in the North and South of the state have banned the sale of poultry meat. Restaurants and hotels in the capital have also been warned and strictly ordered to not serve egg or poultry dishes. Earlier today, the Health Department called on citizens of Delhi to avoid panic and not consume half-cooked chicken or eggs. Citizens were also asked to exercise caution while handling raw poultry and wash their hands frequently. "H5N8 is highly pathogenic in birds but the pathogenicity in humans, as well as the likelihood of human infection with avian influenza (AH5N8) virus, is low," Delhi’s recently issued bird flu advisory stated in their notification. "Eat only completely cooked eggs and poultry products cooked at 70 degree Celsius for 30 minutes. Do not consume half-cooked chicken or bird or half-boiled and half-fried eggs." This was announced after the discovery of several ducks at Sanjay Lake and crows across city parks who had reportedly died of the flu in the last few days. Ten samples collected across Mayur Vihar Phase-3, Sanjay Lake and Dwarka tested positive for the avian influenza in Bhopal's National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases. Live birds were culled at the Sanjay Lake on Monday. The area has been sanitized and, along with three other parks in the city, shut down until further notice. The Health Department advised citizens to avoid coming in contact with dead birds or bird secretions as the virus has the potential to spread to humans too. Citizens are to inform their control room at 011-23890318 in cases of contact. Even though Manish Sisodia, the Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi informed the citizens that bird flu does not spread among humans, the government shut down the Ghazipur poultry market for ten days and has now banned the sale and entry of poultry products and livestock from outside the national capital. The Directorate General of Health Services has also emphasized on the proper disposal of slaughterhouse waste. "The Delhi government is making all efforts to check the spread of bird flu and monitoring the situation. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is constantly in touch with officials. There is no need to panic as bird flu does not spread from one person to another," said Manish Sisodia. Dr. Shobha Broor, the former head of department of microbiology at Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), also elaborated that the flu is not likely to spread to humans, except in cases of mutations. “It is not a respiratory infection like Covid-19 and can happen to humans only if they are handling the dead infected birds or poultry that has been infected,” she said. “However, once a person is infected, the disease tends to be severe. The bird flu virus usually attaches with the lower respiratory tract and causes pneumonia.” Apart from the capital, cases of bird flu have been found in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, according to the Union Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying. This is NOT the first time that animal products have been the cause for epidemics and flus of such nature. SARS, Mad Cow Disease, Influenza are just some of the animal borne diseases which have drawn attention to the dangers of raising animals for food. Shortly after the coronavirus pandemic and the Hantavirus in China, the bird flu is the third big scare originating from animals agricultural practices in the recent months. A mutation of coronavirus was also reported last year in some of Europe’s biggest mink fur farms. Will bird flu become the next pandemic? When the natural state of biodiversity is disturbed through human intervention, it creates an imbalance in the larger ecosystems. This also leads to the development of zoonotic diseases and the consequent spread of epidemics. Industrialized and commercial animal agriculture is the biggest disrupting factor of biodiversity, and has proven to be dangerous for public health time and again.

So far, Bengal has remained untouched by H5N1 or bird flu, but health experts said in the absence of precautionary measures, the infection could cross state borders in no time. West Bengal has remained untouched by H5N1 or bird flu KOLKATA: The state health department is keeping a close watch on the spread of avian influenza that has hit at least nine states in the country. So far, Bengal has remained untouched by H5N1 or bird flu, but health experts said in the absence of precautionary measures, the infection could cross state borders in no time.The state health department on Monday issued an extensive guideline on preparedness to prevent bird flu from reaching Bengal.The advisory issued to chief medical officers of health (CMOH)s of all districts and that of Kolkata Municipal Corporation asks health officials to step up surveillance and keep all public health machinery ready. "Though bird flu is a rare disease among humans and is similar to common cold or flu, it can turn dangerous. Several cases have been reported in Bengal in the past few years though those did not lead to outbreaks. Surveillance should be carried out strictly to check the spread. At the same time, people must be aware and take proper precaution, like cooking the meat and eggs adequately to get rid of pathogen," said public health expert Anirban Dalui.The avian flu cases started with unexplained deaths of birds and poultry in Kerala, Rajasthan and Haryana this year. Later, those were confirmed as avian influenza deaths and the infection gradually spread to 10 states. Bengal government has told all district health officials to keep a tab on unusual deaths or symptoms in birds or poultry and alert the animal husbandry and public health departments immediately. The advisory also says public awareness programmes be taken up in order to prevent bird to human interface and that people must wear gloves, goggles and masks while handling sick or dead birds. "Like in Covid-19, people handling sick or dead birds or poultry should wear preventive gears, like PPE, as bird-to-human transmission of H5N1 mostly happen while handling them. It hardly spreads from properly cooked meat. Since the virus is heat sensitive, thoroughly cooked meat should not be a concern as far infection is concerned. Oseltamivir is the medication if a person get infected," said Sanjib Bandyopadhyay, community medicine specialist, ID Hospital.The health department has also asked all districts to keep sufficient stock of PPE kits, VTM (viral transport medium), swab sticks and oseltamivir capsules and syrups.

A joint statement, made on Wednesday by the Ministry of Agriculture, through the department of Livestock Services (DLS) and the Ministry of Health, through its Epidemiology and disease control unit (EDC), and the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) and the Department of Parks and wildlife Management (DPWM) under the Ministry of Environment, informs the general public of a reported outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (Bird Flu) of the type H5N1 in neighbour of Senegal. The statement said this public health concern happened in a Layer Poultry Farm in Thies, Senegal, with 100,000 chickens of which 58,000 chickens got sick and died from the disease while the remaining 42,000 chickens were killed as a measure to control the outbreak. “The official notification was issued to the OIE (World Organization for Animal Health) on the 7th of January 2021 and it’s through this means that the Veterinary Services of The Gambia knows about the event,” the statement disclosed. According to the statement, the national taskforce, composed of EDC, NDMA, and DPWM and led by DLS, is invoking the Integrated national emergency preparedness and response plan for Avian and Human Influenza (AHI) (2015-2019) for the implementation of the necessary activities to address the risk posed by the presence of HPAI virus in Senegal and to continue with efforts to further secure its absence in The Gambia. “HPAI, known as Bird Flu, is a highly contagious viral disease with a significant zoonotic risk and a major global public health concern or potential pandemic similar to COVID-19 or even worse. HPAI control measures are centered on domesticated poultry like chicken. “The DLS and its partners are taking this opportunity to urge everyone to remain calm but vigilant and report any unusual animal health event in poultry only to DLS staff. “The ultimate objective of this message is protecting human lives and enhancing food security being a clear indication of the commitment of The Government of The Gambia to protect its citizens and their livelihoods,” the statement said.

Amid bird flu outbreak in 10 states, the Union Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying on Thursday said it has asked its civil aviation counterpart to allow uninterrupted transportation of samples for expeditious testing in designated laboratories.This comes in the wake of some states banning the supply of poultry and poultry products without testing the samples, creating panic and hurting the industry badly.Bird flu or avian influenza outbreak has been confirmed in Delhi, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and Gujarat so far.Also Read India Gears Up for Battle-Ready Integrated Groups Along Its Borders US Election 2024: What’s the better choice for India?

Consumption of well-cooked chicken and eggs does not pose any risk to humans,” it asserted.The statement said Union Minister of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying Giriraj Singh discussed in a virtual meeting with Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and Mayors of Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) about the ban on the supply of poultry and poultry products.Singh emphasised on removing the ban and the Delhi Government revoked the restrictions with immediate effect, it added.Following the advisories of the central government, states are creating awareness through newspaper advertisements, social media platforms etc.Also, constant efforts are being made to generate awareness about bird flu and how to deal with the situation among the general public through various media platforms, including social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook handles, it added.

This is said to occur naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other birds and animals, explained the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Can humans contract bird flu? According to CDC, Avian flu viruses ‘do not normally infect human beings’. Such an infection is rare, says Mayo Clinic website, but adds saying that if infected, the virus ‘can be deadly’. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), bird flu can be transmitted from one person to another, but again this is a rarity. From 2003 to 2019, the WHO confirmed a total of 861 human cases of H5N1 worldwide, of which 455 deaths were recorded.(With inputs from NDTV and The Indian Express.)(At The Quint, we question everything.

Context:Avian influenza, popularly known as bird flu, has been reported from Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh in recent weeks.In recent, reports of unusual deaths of a large number of birds, including wild ones, started coming in from many States, indicating that the virus is being actively transmitted among various bird groups.Spread of the disease through outbreaks of H5N1 and H5N8:The two virus types identified so far in the outbreaks H5N1 and H5N8 come under the category of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), which is of major concern to those keeping birds, because it leads to disease and death of fowl and causes economic havoc. H5N1 is a known threat to humans as well.The spread of the disease in a variety of birds in several geographical regions, and the seasonal movement of migratory birds, have prompted the Centre to issue an alert to States to adhere to the National Action Plan for Prevention, Control and Containment of Avian Influenza 2021.Internationally, the World Animal Health Information System in December 2020 identified outbreaks of HPAI in Taiwan, Iran, Israel, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam, a dozen European Union countries, Ukraine, Russia and the U.K., leading to a loss of over 4.8 million birds by the end of December 2020.While avian influenza virus crossing the species barrier and directly infecting humans happens occasionally, human-to-human spread has been rare.But mutations or genetic reassortment of an avian influenza A virus and a human influenza A virus in a person can create a new influenza A virus that could likely result in sustained transmission between humans, thus increasing the risk of a pandemic influenza.Hence, all efforts should be directed at stamping out the outbreaks in the affected States. It is also important to undertake genome sequencing of virus samples to track the evolution of the virus.How serious is avian flu for bird health?Avian Influenza (AI) is a highly contagious viral disease, affecting a variety of birds, including those connected with human consumption chickens, ducks, turkeys, quails as well as pet birds and wild birds.The World Organization for Animal Health, which collaborates with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), says HPAI virus strains H5N1, H5N2, H5N8, H7N8 have been identified in outbreaks, indicating active circulation. Infection histories point to H5N1 and H7N9 viruses posing a threat to human health as well.What is the economic impact of bird flu?India’s poultry sector, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, is worth Rs.80,000 crore, of which the organised sector represents 80%, and the rest is distributed among unorganised sectors, including backyard poultry-keeping which is crucial for income and nutritional security.Exports, mainly focused on West Asia, neighbouring countries and East Asia, were valued at ₹532 crore in 2017, with an emphasis on processed products such as egg powder, yolk powder, pharma ingredients, and chicken products.Avian flu is seen as a threat to the further growth of the sector as a whole.By the government’s estimates, there are 30 million farmers who keep backyard birds, while small and medium farmers who contribute to aggregators are crucial players in the larger ecosystem. India has a base of over 729 million poultry birds, of which 30% are layers and 40% are broilers, according to the National Action Plan for Egg and Poultry 2022. This large base shows that a serious outbreak of HPAI, as was witnessed during 2005-06 in some States, can be catastrophic. During that year, official data put the number of culled birds at over one million.In later years, bird flu surfaced in several States, such as Manipur, Assam, West Bengal, Tripura, Bihar, and Kerala, leading to destruction of millions of birds.Where culling of birds is undertaken to combat bird flu, the National Action Plan prescribes compensation to be given to farmers at fixed rates. This, once again, underscores the value of prevention to protect captive birds.Way Forward: Steps can be taken to minimise risk to domestic birds:Governments lay down biosecurity measures to keep domestic birds safe from transmission by wild or migratory birds and prevent local spread.The protocol involves active surveillance of bird areas to identify emerging outbreaks. On the other hand, it is wrong and counterproductive, the FAO cautions, to attempt elimination of wild birds near human settlements through hunting, poisoning, and habitat destruction. Such activity disperses wild birds, and the viruses, to new areas. Moreover, hunting of wild birds and the absence of biosecurity measures bring the viruses directly to domestic fowl.In the wake of an outbreak in 2020, the U.K. issued advice making it legally necessary for bird-keepers in that country to house them in such a manner that they do not come into contact with wild birds.Conclusion:The measures, which have general relevance to farmers everywhere, include housing or netting all captive birds, cleansing and disinfecting clothing, footwear and vehicles, reduction of people’s movement in the farm bird areas to reduce contamination.Eliminating or reducing contact between captive and wild birds, particularly through feed and water storage, and cleansing and disinfecting production areas. The U.K. uses a checklist approach to help farmers with best practices.In India, the Central government requires veterinary staff to conduct inspections periodically under the Prevention and Control of Infectious and Contagious Diseases in Animals Act, 2009, to catch any signs of disease among birds and other animals early.However, aquatic wild birds are often found in close proximity to domestic ones in many locations in India, near lakes, dams and reservoirs, making it difficult to achieve segregation. The waterways of Kerala are a good example of this phenomenon.

The state health department headed by the chief minister Miss Mamata Banerjee has directed chief medical officers of health (CMOH) in districts and Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) to keep watch on patients showing symptoms avian influenza as well bird flu. “Bird flu infections are hardly seen among human beings. But at this trying time of Covid-19 pandemic ravaging the country we have alerted health administrations in districts and urban local bodies to intensify surveillance on any report of bird flu infections caused by H5N1 virus. There has been no report of bird flu either among birds or human beings so far in our state,” Dr Ajay Chakraborty, director of health services (DHS), told The Statesman today.

Dhoni’s farm managers had also credited advance sums into Meda’s bank account for the supply of the chicks.It was in August 2020 that Dhoni’s farm managers had got in touch with Meda through the Krishi Vikas Kendra (KVK) and MP Kadaknath mobile phone app. Subsequently, Meda had secured the order.Confirming the development, the state’s director (animal husbandry) Dr RK Rokde said on Tuesday that four-five days ago, samples of Kadaknath chicken from a poultry farm in the Jhabua district had been sent to the National Institute of High-Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD-Bhopal).“We received a letter from NIHSAD Bhopal on Tuesday informing that Kadaknath chicken samples from that poultry farm in Runipada village of Jhabua district’s Thandla block have tested positive for the Bird flu causing H5N1 virus,” Dr Rokde said.“Subsequently, the deputy director (animal husbandry) in Jhabua district has been directed to act in the matter as per the central government’s Bird flu Action Plan 2021, which includes culling, compensation, disposal of poultry, feed material, eggs, etc. Clean-up and the disinfection-sanitization process will also be subsequently initiated at the concerned poultry farm. Further, treating the one km radius of the farm as Infected Zone, the chicks in the other poultry farms of the infected zone will also be culled,” he added.ALSO READ | MP's black chicken variety Kadaknath wins over Captain Cool MS DhoniThe re-stocking and commercial movement of chicks aged up to three months will be banned in the infected zone. Further, a 9 km area in the radius of the infected zone will be treated as a surveillance zone owing to which surveillance and sample collection of chicks from farms and shops will take place.Acting on the directives from Bhopal, an official team headed by Jhabua district deputy director (animal husbandry) Wilson Dabar and Tehsildar (Thandla) Shakti Singh Chauhan led a team to Meda’s farm in the evening at Runipada’s village. The team culled 799 Kadaknath chicken from Meda’s farm. A total of 935 Kadaknath chicken (including 135 chickens which had already died due to the killer virus before the team arrived) from the concerned were subsequently disposed of as per the standard safety protocol.Totally devastated, the young farmer Vinod Meda had tears in his eyes. “I’m totally devastated, I had to supply the chicks to MS Dhoni’s farm in Ranchi on January 10, but a week before that my Kadaknath chickens and chicks started dying suddenly. I lost up to 2,500 chicks-chicken due to it. I reported the matter to local administration, after which samples from my farm were sent for testing in Bhopal. I got to know about the Bird flu confirmation report this evening only,” Medha said.Also known as 'Kali Masi', the black chicken variety 'Kadaknath' is a unique chicken breed that’s black in colour, which is found in the tribal-dominated Jhabua district of MP’s Bheelanchal region. The Kadaknath chicken meat from Jhabua had also got GI tag in 2018 after a legal battle with Chhattisgarh. This chicken variety is believed to possess inherent medicinal properties with high protein and low cholesterol and fat content when compared to other chicken varieties.According to state Director (Animal Husbandry) Dr. RK Rokde, “Following Tuesday’s development, Jhabua district has become our state’s first district, where indigenously bread chicks-chicken samples at a poultry farm have been found to be Bird flu positive. Earlier, in three districts, Indore, Neemuch, and Agar-Malwa, swab samples of chicken extracted from tables and knives of chicken-poultry shops in the market had been found Avian Influenza positive. All those shops stored chicken sourced from farms outside MP.”Following this, nearly 500 chickens at shops in the infected zone of Indore, Agar-Malwa, and Neemuch districts were culled and disposed of.The Bird flu outbreak has now been confirmed in 19 districts of MP following the deaths of around 1400 crows, bagula (heron) and other birds.
