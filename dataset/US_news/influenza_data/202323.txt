The Forum served as a platform for international experts, private sector and government representatives to engage in meaningful discussions about the current challenges and perspectives for combatting avian influenza. Since 2005, the toll of avian influenza has been staggering, with over 500 million birds lost to the disease. Its devastating impact extends beyond domestic and wild birds, threatening livelihoods and food security alike. The recent paradigm change in the ecology and epidemiology of avian influenza has heightened global concern as the disease has spread to new geographical regions, has caused unusual wild bird die-offs, and has led to an alarming rise in mammalian cases. The rapidly evolving nature and the changes in spread patterns have encouraged leaders and experts to review existing avian influenza prevention and control tools, including the use of vaccines. Vaccinating is not the end, it is just the beginning. Vaccination application needs to be managed along the supply chain including a surveillance programme which is able to detect active infection in vaccinated animals.Dr David Swayne, Disease Expert and Forum rapporteur The Animal Health Forum held during WOAH’s recent 90th General Session convened key stakeholders and the full membership of the Organisation to discuss how to minimise the impacts of avian influenza across sectors. Based on the Technical Item—’Strategic Challenges in the Global Control of High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza’ presented at the event, participants discussed the impact of the disease, the fitness for purpose of existing prevention and control tools, international trade impact, and the necessity to enhance global coordination. Following the Forum, WOAH issued a comprehensive report capturing the discussions and outcomes. Vaccination emerged as a critical point of discussion. Countries that previously relied on conventional methods to control avian influenza are now facing overwhelming challenges that have prompted them to explore additional measures. Alongside biosecurity, movement control and stamping out, WOAH’s General Assembly debated the use of vaccination as a complementary tool and extensively discussed its associated implementation challenges. It was recognised that a successful vaccination strategy must rely on authorised vaccines that closely match the virus strains in circulation. Furthermore, it must be accompanied by robust disease surveillance, which is able to demonstrate freedom from infection in the domestic animal population as recommended by WOAH Terrestrial Animal Health Code. By considering all existing science-based control measures and using them in line with international recommendations, countries can develop their own national strategies tailored to their local context and ensure their effectiveness. WOAH Members adopted a Resolution which will serve as a basis for shaping future avian influenza control activities, while protecting wildlife, supporting the poultry industry and the continuity of trade. The Resolution notably underscores the importance of Members respecting and implementing WOAH international standards to effectively combat avian influenza. Recognising the compliant use of vaccination without negative consequences on trade as per WOAH standards further stresses the need for robust vaccination monitoring and disease surveillance systems. There is no one-size fits all solution, but I am convinced that through close collaboration and adherence to our standards, we can further optimise control measures at our disposal against avian influenza, including vaccination. I applaud the outcomes of the Forum and the adoption of the Resolution by our Members. It demonstrates our shared commitment to effectively control the disease at all levels.Dr Monique Eloit, WOAH Director General WOAH remains steadfast in its commitment to address the global avian influenza crisis. Through our normative work, convening efforts and support to our Members, we aim to safeguard animal and human health, protect biodiversity, and preserve the livelihoods of those affected worldwide.

Therefore, it is important to evaluate syndromic surveillance data, including that from ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a complete and accurate picture of influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and other respiratory virus activity. Other respiratory virus surveillance data can be found on CDC’s COVID Data Tracker, NCIRD Surveillance Systems website and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) website. Outpatient Respiratory Illness Visits Nationwide during week 22, 1.9% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to respiratory illness that included fever plus a cough or sore throat, also referred to as ILI. Multiple respiratory viruses are co-circulating, and the relative contribution of influenza virus infection to ILI varies by location. * Effective October 3, 2021 (week 40), the ILI definition (fever plus cough or sore throat) no longer includes “without a known cause other than influenza.” View Chart Data (current season only) | View Full Screen Outpatient Respiratory Illness Visits by Age Group More than 70% of ILINet participants provide both the number of patient visits for respiratory illness and the total number of patient visits for the week broken out by age group. Data from this subset of providers are used to calculate the percentages of patient visits for respiratory illness by age group. During week 22, the percentage of visits for respiratory illness reported in ILINet was 6.1% among those 0-4 years, 3.2% among those 5-24 years, 1.5% among those 25-49 years, 1.0% among those 50-64 years, and 0.7% among those 65 years and older.

Study: Prevalence and Patient Risk Factors for Pneumothorax in COVID-19 and in Influenza: A Nationwide Comparative Analysis. Image Credit: luchschenF/Shutterstock.com*Important notice: Preprints with The Lancet / SSRN publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information. Background Patients with COVID-19 who require mechanical ventilation are at a higher risk for the rare but fatal complication of pneumothorax. Research has shown that hospitalized COVID-19 patients have a 1-2% pneumothorax incidence rate. The proposed mechanism involves the formation of cysts and decreased lung compliance due to distortion of lung parenchyma and fibrotic changes. Studies have shown that COVID-19 patients who develop pneumothorax have a higher mortality risk. Nationwide studies on the risk factors, prevalence, and mortality of pneumothorax in COVID-19 patients are scarce, despite numerous case series and reports about its epidemiology among COVID-19 patients. About the study The team employed the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) 2020 dataset, a US healthcare database that provides national and regional estimates of inpatient access, care utilization, quality, cost, and outcomes. The study included adult patients aged 18 and older who reported COVID-19 and influenza. Socioeconomic and comorbidity risk factors were identified in the eligible patient cohort for pneumothorax among COVID-19 patients and its related mortality. The study's primary outcomes involved determining the prevalence of pneumothorax among COVID-19 patients and identifying the comorbidity and socioeconomic risk factors associated with these patients. Additionally, secondary outcomes compared COVID-19 patients with and without pneumothorax and compared the risk of pneumothorax in influenza versus COVID-19. Related StoriesGenetic risk factors for long-COVID uncovered in a large multi-ethnic studyOne in four healthy young Marines report long-term physical, cognitive, or psychiatric effects after mild COVID-19Seasonal influenza adapted and evolved during the COVID-19 pandemicThe NIS variables provided information on patients' demographic characteristics such as age, sex, race, insurance status, and income quartiles according to zip code. The Elixhauser Comorbidity Index employed in the study included uncomplicated and complicated hypertension, uncomplicated and complicated diabetes, solid cancer, liver disease, chronic pulmonary disorders, and rheumatoid arthritis or collagen vascular diseases. Results Approximately 22,545 out of 1,608,980 COVID-19-positive hospitalized patients in 2020 developed pneumothorax. The average age of patients who experienced pneumothorax was 64.5 years. The occurrence of pneumothorax rises with age. Pneumothorax prevalence was 5.7%, 39.7%, and 52.1% among those aged between 18 to 40 years, 41 to 64 years, and over 65 years. Approximately 66% of the COVID-19 patients from the pneumothorax cohort were males, while 34% were females. Pneumothorax patients had notably higher hospitalization expenses compared to those without the condition. Patients with pneumothorax incurred an average hospitalization cost of $437,692, significantly higher than the $87,081 average cost incurred by patients without pneumothorax. Furthermore, patients with pneumothorax had a significantly higher mortality rate of 68.7% compared to 13% in those without pneumothorax. According to multivariate analysis, the probability of developing pneumothorax is lower in females. Patients with Medicaid and Medicare had lower odds of developing pneumothorax than those with private insurance. The study also found that African American patients had a lower risk of pneumothorax compared to Caucasians. However, Native Americans, Hispanics, and patients of other races reported a higher risk, with Native Americans having the highest risk. Certain medical conditions and treatments increase the risk of developing pneumothorax, including a history of stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), malnutrition, pulmonary fibrosis, liver disease, bronchiectasis, and positive pressure ventilation methods such as bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and high flow nasal cannula (HFNC). The odds of pneumothorax among intubated and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) patients were very high. The probability of pneumothorax occurrence was low in individuals with substance abuse, nicotine abuse, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Pneumothorax patients also reported a significantly increased risk of cardiac arrest and mortality from any cause. According to Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, COVID-19 patients with pneumothorax had significantly higher mortality rates than those without pneumothorax, particularly during extended hospital stays. Notably, the survival probability for patients with pneumothorax decreased as their length of stay rose. While the occurrence of pneumothorax was reduced between March and December 2020, its mortality rate did not change. Conclusion COVID-19 can lead to a rare complication called pneumothorax, a serious prognostic marker with a high mortality risk. Pneumothorax can develop due to various risk factors such as sex, age, malnutrition, certain lung conditions, liver disease, and other comorbidities.

Framed by a model of nucleic acid proteins is (from left) Weaver; Matt Pekarek, a graduate student in the Weaver Lab; Cedric Wooledge, a technician with the Institutional Animal Care Program; David Steffen, with the Nebraska Veterinary Diagnostic Center; and Nicholas Jeanjaquet and Erika Petro-Turnquist, both doctoral students in the Weaver Lab. Not pictured is Hiep Vu, assistant professor in the Nebraska Center for Virology and Department of Animal Science. A successful long-term experiment with live hogs indicates Nebraska scientists may be another step closer to achieving a safe, long-lasting and potentially universal vaccine against swine flu. The results are not only important to the pork industry, they hold significant implications for human health. That’s because pigs act as “mixing vessels,” where various swine and bird influenza strains can reconfigure and become transmissible to humans. In fact, the 2009 swine flu pandemic, involving a variant of the H1N1 strain, first emerged in swine before infecting about a fourth of the global population in its first year, causing nearly 12,500 deaths in the United States and perhaps as many as 575,000 worldwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Considering the significant role swine play in the evolution and transmission of potential pandemic strains of influenza and the substantial economic impact of swine flu viruses, it is imperative that efforts be made toward the development of more effective vaccination strategies in vulnerable pig populations,” said Erika Petro-Turnquist, a doctoral student and lead author of the study recently published in Frontiers in Immunology. Petro-Turnquist is advised by Eric Weaver, associate professor and director of the Nebraska Center for Virology. Weaver’s laboratory is spearheading an effort that uses Epigraph, a data-based computer technique co-developed by Bette Korber and James Theiler of Los Alamos National Laboratory, to create a more broad-based vaccine against influenza, which is notoriously difficult to prevent because it mutates rapidly. Pork producers currently try to manage swine flu by using commercially available vaccines derived from whole inactivated viruses and weakened live viruses. As of 2008, about half of the vaccines in use in the United States were custom-made for specific herds — an expensive, time-consuming and not very effective strategy because of the rapidity with which swine influenza evolves. The Epigraph algorithm enables scientists to analyze countless amino acid sequences among hundreds of flu virus variants to create a vaccine “cocktail” of the three most common epitopes — the bits of viral protein that spark the immune system’s response. It could be a pathway to a universal flu vaccine, which the National Institutes of Health defines as a vaccine that is at least 75% effective, protects against multiple types of influenza viruses for at least one year and is suitable for all age groups. “The first epitope looks like a normal influenza vaccine gene, the second one looks a little weird and third is more rare,” Weaver said. “We’re reversing the evolution and bringing these sequences that the immune system recognizes as pathogens back together. We’re computationally re-linking them and that’s where the power of this vaccine is coming from, that it provides such good protections against such a wide array of viruses.” In another strategy to heighten effectiveness, the vaccine is delivered via adenovirus, a common virus that causes cold-like symptoms. Its use as a vector triggers additional immune response by mimicking a natural viral infection. Two years ago, Weaver’s team published initial results in the journal Nature Communications, based on tests in mice and pigs. Those findings indicated the Epigraph-developed vaccine yielded immune response signatures and physiological protection against a much wider variety of strains than a widely used commercial vaccine and wildtype flu strains. The follow-up study is apparently the first longitudinal study comparing the onset and duration of an adenovirus-vectored vaccine with that of a whole inactive virus vaccine. Petro-Turnquist and Weaver, along with Matthew Pekarek, Nicholas Jeanjaquet and Hiep Vu of the Department of Animal Science, Cedric Wooledge of the Office of Research and Economic Development and David Steffen of the Nebraska Veterinary Diagnostic Center, observed 15 Yorkshire cross-bred female pigs over a period of about six months, the typical lifespan of a market hog. One group of five received the Epigraph vaccine, a second group of five received a commercial whole inactive virus vaccine, and a third group of five received a saline solution to serve as the control group. The pigs received their initial vaccination at three weeks of age and a booster shot three weeks later. Their antibody levels and T-cell responses were measured weekly for the first month and every 30 days thereafter. At six months of age, they were exposed to a strain of swine flu divergent from those directly represented in the vaccine. The pigs that received the Epigraph vaccine showed more rapid and long-lasting antibody and T-cell responses to the vaccines. After exposure to the swine flu virus, the Epigraph-vaccinated hogs showed significantly better protection against the disease — less viral shedding, fewer symptoms of infection and stronger immune system responses. “Those pigs weighed about five pounds when we vaccinated them and by the end of the study, six months later, they were over 400 pounds,” Weaver said. “It’s kind of amazing that this vaccine would maintain itself over that rate of growth. It continues to expand as the animal grows.” Weaver’s team continues to pursue the research, with next steps including larger studies and possibly a commercial partnership to bring the vaccine to market. “The more times we do these studies, the more confident we get that this vaccine will be successful in the field,” Weaver said.

Bald eagles are near the top of the list of bird species in Alaska that have been killed by the currently circulating strains of highly pathogenic avian influenza. (Photo by Lisa Hupp/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) Migrating birds have returned to Alaska, and so has the highly pathogenic avian influenza that began to sweep through global bird populations in 2020. That means Alaskans should continue to be vigilant about the strains that have arrived in the state from across both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, experts said during a webinar Tuesday hosted by the Alaska Native Tribal Health Symposium’s Local Environmental Observer Network. Alaska’s geographic position, at a point on the globe where different avian flyways converge, makes it a transmission zone for separate strains from both the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. “Alaska’s in a unique position for a mixing of viruses from Asia and North America,” said January Frost of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. This influenza wave appears to pose only minute risks to people. So far, there have been only a handful of human cases globally, and those were among people working closely with poultry, said Andy Ramey, a wildlife geneticist and avian influenza expert with the U.S. Geological Survey’s Alaska Science Center. But for wild birds and other wild animals, it has proved a dangerous illness. Along with the 58 million domestic chickens and other poultry birds lost to the virus in the United States, nearly 7,000 wild birds have died. That is in addition to various mammals like foxes, coyotes, skunks and bears, according to the latest tally. The effects on wild birds make the outbreak much different from other versions of avian influenza, Ramey and Frost said.

Northern pintails are on the list of wild bird species most frequently found killed by the currently circulating highly pathogenic avian influenza. (Photo by Nathan Graff/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Serivce) “A few years ago, high-path avian influenza was a poultry disease. And for whatever reason, this high-path avian influenza, these recent strains, have become really well-adapted to wild birds,” Ramey said, referring to high-pathogen viruses. “We’re really in uncharted waters, so to speak.” In the past, he said, it was assumed that outbreaks would be confined to poultry and would die out there, he said. “I don’t know if that still holds true,” he said. In Alaska, the documented case count is 232 wild birds, three foxes and two bears as of early this week, Ramey said. Those are cases of animals that were found dead or dying, with confirmation in laboratories of highly pathogenic avian influenza infections. That means the cases represent only a small fraction of the effects in the wild, Ramey said, as most cases likely go unnoticed and unreported by people. It is common for wild birds to carry numerous influenza viruses, usually of the low-pathogenic variety, according to the USGS. Less common are highly pathogenic viruses, so categorized because they are transmitted easily within domestic poultry flocks; they are of concern because they can kill large amounts of poultry and therefore have significant economic consequences. Until now, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses have not been much of an issue for the health of wild birds, even though they are carriers and can transmit viruses between continents. For wild birds, the danger of the current influenza is that vulnerable populations could suffer significant losses. This spring, for example, several California condors were killed by the virus. For a critically endangered population numbering only about 560, the loss of several birds was seen as alarming enough to prompt the U.S. Department of Agriculture to start a flu-vaccination program for the birds.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon) In Alaska, the birds most commonly found to be victims of this influenza are waterfowl. The top species with documented cases are mallards, bald eagles, ravens, northern pintails, glaucous gulls, American green-winged teals, Canada geese, American wigeons, brant and Sabine’s gulls, Ramey and Frost said in their presentation. The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation’s running tally of confirmed avian influenza infections does not list any birds with Endangered Species Act protections. However, there have been suspected cases among spectacled and Steller’s eiders, and both species are listed as threatened. There have been no documented cases of avian influenza in Alaska marine mammals, but there have been elsewhere. For example, avian influenza was linked to a die-off last year of several harbor seals and gray seals in Maine. The National Marine Fisheries Service is monitoring Alaska marine mammals for signs of influenza, Ramey said. There are recommended precautions for Alaska bird hunters, even though this virus has rarely been transmitted to people. They should wear protective gear, clean knives and surfaces that come in contact with birds and take other measures, including cooking all meat and eggs to internal temperatures of 165 degrees Fahrenheit. That last guideline may represent a departure from usual operations in parts of Alaska, Frost said. “I know it may not be the typical way that people cook their food or eat their eggs, but in order to be as safe as possible, this is what is recommended,” she said.

Korea Times photo by Ha Sang-yunBy Lee Hae-rinInfluenza, which typically strikes during winter, has spread at an alarming level in late spring, marking the highest number of patients for a late spring and early summer season. Health experts and authorities presume eased COVID-19 rules involving face masks and in-person gatherings have caused an influenza surge.According to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA), Sunday, the number of people with symptoms of flu stood at 25.7 per 1,000 outpatients from May 14 to 27. This figure was also the same for the previous week.It was the highest number seen during that period of the year since September 2000 when the KDCA started collecting related statistics. In previous years, the figure has remained at less than five per 1,000 outpatients. The previous record was seven during May 14 to 27 of 2021.Also, flu cases normally decline after the peak winter season. But this time, the number peaked at 60.7 in the last week of 2022, declined to 11.6 from Feb. 19 to 25, but bounced back in the spring season.The younger age groups have been more vulnerable to the flu with 52.8 per 1,000 outpatients aged seven to 12 and 49.5 per 1,000 outpatients aged 13 to 18 being diagnosed."The growing spread of flu will continue for a while, due to the increased social interactions following the lifting of COVID-19-related social-distancing measures," Gwack Jin, a senior KDCA official said.Apart from the flu, acute respiratory infections with symptoms of nasal discharge, headache, phlegm and sore throat are also spreading, the KDCA said. KDCA collects flu patient information from 196 medical centers across the country and announces related statistics. Those who show symptoms of sudden fevers of over 38 degrees Celsius or higher, coughing and sore throat are classified as suspected cases of influenza. lhr@koreatimes.co.kr More articles by this reporter Most Read in National 1Yoon practices golf in case of possible round with Trump2Seoul City to test UAM service next year for 2030 commercialization 3Police officer acquitted after alleged prostitution involvement during college years 4Korea to launch economic consultative bodies to brace for Trump 2.0 5Chinese man released from police custody after questioning over filming NIS building with drone Top 10 Stories 1Yoon practices golf in case of possible round with Trump2Seoul City to test UAM service next year for 2030 commercialization 3Korean food makers ramp up global expansion4Police officer acquitted after alleged prostitution involvement during college years 5Halfway through president’s term, Koreans notice no significant economic recovery6N.

Private laboratories have also detected increasing numbers of influenza cases, and NICD has received reports of influenza clusters in schools and workplaces. The 2023 influenza season started in week 17 (week starting 27 April 2023) when the influenza detection rate (3-week moving average) breached the seasonal threshold and remained on low activity for two consecutive weeks in the pneumonia surveillance programme (figure 1). The increase in case numbers has been identified in all 6 provinces where surveillance is conducted. As of 28 May 2023, the most commonly detected subtype and lineage is influenza A (H3N2) (146/272, 55%), followed by influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 (116/272, 43%) and, influenza B Victoria (3/272, 1%). 181 samples have subtyping results pending. Influenza A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, and influenza B are common seasonal influenza strains in humans. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, which is sometimes incorrectly referred to as “swine flu” has been one of the circulating seasonal influenza strains following its emergence in 2009. The term “swine flu” should not be used as it causes unnecessary panic. The clinical course of infection and management of this strain is similar to other influenza strains. Although the majority of people with influenza will present with mild illness, influenza may cause severe illness, which may require hospitalisation or cause death, especially in individuals who are at risk of getting severe influenza illness or complications. Groups at increased risk of severe illness or complications of influenza include pregnant women, people living with HIV, people with chronic illnesses or conditions like diabetes, lung disease, tuberculosis, heart disease, renal disease and obesity, the elderly (65 years and older) and children less than 2 years old. These groups should be encouraged to seek medical help early. As the influenza season has started, the influenza vaccine remains the primary means for preventing seasonal influenza infection (figure 1). Ideally, the vaccine should be administered before the influenza season (March to April). However, even if the season has already started, it is never too late to get vaccinated, especially for individuals who have high risk of severe influenza illness or complications. To prevent contracting or spreading the influenza virus, the following measures are recommended: avoid close contact with sick individuals, stay home when sick, cover mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, regularly clean hands, avoid touching the mouth, eyes, and nose, and clean and disinfect commonly used surfaces. Clinicians should include influenza as a possible diagnosis when managing patients with respiratory illness.

Sleep problems also increased the risk of COVID-19 infection requiring hospitalisation. The study, led by researchers at the University of Helsinki, shows that a previous diagnosis of insomnia increases the risk of developing respiratory infections. In total, the study covered more than 600,000 individuals from Finland (the FinnGen study) and United Kingdom (the UK Biobank). Among the Finnish individuals with diagnosis of insomnia, the risk of developing an unspecified respiratory infection was almost six times higher and the risk of influenza more than four times higher, compared to the other participants. Analyses based on the UK biobank data supported the association between insomnia diagnosis and risk of respiratory infections. Genetic analysis suggests a causal relationship Previous studies have suggested an association between short-term insomnia or sleep deprivation and immune system and defense against pathogens. The link between chronic insomnia and susceptibility to infection has also been investigated, but large-scale population studies have rarely been done and the large number of genetic instruments needed for testing causality have only recently become available. The current study used methods of genetic epidemiology to examine a possible causal link between insomnia and infections. This study found that insomnia increases the risk of respiratory infections. Furthermore, these findings highlighted an association between insomnia and the severity of COVID-19 symptoms as well as COVID-19 infection requiring hospitalization. The advantage of this kind of study design is that it makes use of longitudinal data. In addition, the genetic analysis allows for the identification of causal relationships between two traits. In this particular study we test causality leveraging genetic analysis tools that use randomization to estimate causality." Dr. Hanna Ollila from the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), University of Helsinki The researchers were also able to demonstrate that the results are not explained by factors such as obesity or smoking, both of which are known to predispose to both insomnia and respiratory infections. Approximately 30% of adults suffer from insomnia according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Therefore, the findings also have public health implications. "Our results are in line with earlier literature and show that getting enough sleep is important for maintaining an effective immune defense", Hanna Ollila concludes. The study was carried out by the University of Helsinki and Harvard Medical School in collaboration with Yale and Stanford Universities.

The white birds in the background are Herring Gulls, which also nest on the island. Photo courtesy of Sumner Matteson A state avian ecologist says a highly contagious bird flu that hit Wisconsin last year may have been the most deadly avian flu outbreak ever for wild birds in the Midwest.Last year, highly pathogenic avian influenza killed almost two-thirds of the state’s breeding population of Caspian terns. The white gull-sized tern with a black cap and coral-red bill is a state endangered bird. It’s only found at three sites in Wisconsin: Hat Island and Gravel Island off the coast of the Door County peninsula, as well as the Cat Island Chain in lower Green Bay.Sumner Matteson, a state avian ecologist with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, said last year researchers followed pairs of terns on 960 nests at three sites in the state, a total of 1,920 birds. Sixty-four percent of them died of the virus. Stay informed on the latest news Sign up for WPR’s email newsletter. Email EmailThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged. It was the most devastating experience he’s ever had in more than 40 years in the field, he said.“Seeing not only the dead birds in white lines basically on the gravel and cobble beaches, but to see the scores of dying birds that you could do absolutely nothing about,” Matteson said. Dead and dying Caspian terns line the beach of Gravel Island offshore of the Door County peninsula on June 2, 2022. Photo courtesy of Sumner Matteson Matteson said the good news is they’ve found no sign of sick or dead birds so far this year. A survey last week found no Caspian terns on Hat Island and 129 nests on Gravel Island, which is just offshore from Newport State Park in Door County. Matteson said he expects another DNR staff member will survey the Cat Island Chain this week, which didn’t lose any birds last year.He added it will likely take years, if not decades, for the state’s Caspian tern population to recover. Based on what he’s seen, the highly contagious bird flu is not a problem this year. “I would say we were most joyous…over the fact that we did not see any of it in our tern colonies,” Matteson said. “Because had we seen it again, it might have meant the possible extirpation of Caspian terns from Wisconsin.”Matteson said the bird is an indicator species that’s sensitive to changes in the environment. He said Caspian terns are especially vulnerable to the disease because they tend to mingle more with colonies of water birds like cormorants and pelicans when they migrate to the Gulf Coast.In Wisconsin, the disease has been detected in many wild birds that include Caspian terns, geese, swans, mallards, sandhill cranes and bald eagles. Dead and dying Caspian terns rest inches away from their doomed nests on Gravel Island offshore of the Door County peninsula on June 2, 2022. Photo courtesy of Sumner Matteson Volunteer monitoring of eagle nests across Wisconsin showed chicks didn’t survive to the fledgling stage in two-thirds of nests tracked by the Bald Eagle Nest Watch program. Staff with Madison Audubon, which runs the program, suspect the virus is likely to blame. But there’s reason for hope as volunteers have seen higher survival rates this year.Last year, the program noted roughly 35 percent of 109 nests saw an eaglet reach the fledgling stage where they’re able to take flight.Brenna Marsicek, communications and outreach director for Madison Audubon, said the 65 percent failure rate was much higher than previous years — in a typical year an average of 15 percent of nests fail. While they can’t be certain, staff believe the bird flu outbreak played a major role as birds migrated back to Wisconsin during the spring.“Our hypothesis is that…the adult eagles were accidentally bringing infected prey into the nest, and the chicks didn’t have a large enough body mass to be able to metabolize the infected prey,” Marsicek said. “The chicks likely died as a result of it.”Marsicek said eagles will prey on just about anything, including fish and waterfowl that may be infected with the virus. Despite that, she said monitoring by volunteers found about 85 percent of 101 nests where adults laid eggs had at least one chick this year.

Photo by Scott Emerson “Fortunately, Wisconsin’s eagle population is strong enough that they could weather a year like last year and come back and have a normal nesting year this year,” Marsicek said.The program, which started in 2018, has grown to include six areas where a network of 435 volunteers monitor bald eagle nests. They include the Eau Claire, Fox Valley and Manitowoc areas, as well as Door County and central and southern Wisconsin. Marsicek said they don’t represent all nests in the state by any means, but it provides one dataset from citizen monitoring.While wild birds were affected by the disease, much of the response was focused on domestic poultry. The outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza infected 29 flocks in Wisconsin last year among both commercial poultry owners and small backyard flocks in 18 counties, according to state data. Nearly 3.3 million birds were killed in Wisconsin and almost 58.8 million birds nationwide to prevent the spread of the virus.The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced the first detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza among wild birds in January last year and commercial flocks a month later. The Associated Press reported it had cost the federal government at least $661 million earlier this year, making it less costly than the 2015 outbreak that ran nearly $1 billion.The outbreak was the main cause egg prices spiked to an average of almost $5 for a dozen eggs in January, but federal data shows prices have since dropped to an average of $3.27 for a carton. That’s the lowest price since last September. Wisconsin Public Radio, © Copyright 2024, Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System and Wisconsin Educational Communications Board.

Participating senior centers will receive $10,000 that can be used to support their efforts.There is no deadline. Awards will be available until all the funds have been exhausted.Through a grant from the U.S. Administration for Community Living (ACL), NCOA has lauched a nationwide effort to ensure older adults and people with disabilities get the latest COVID and flu vaccines. NCOA has enlisted its national network of senior centers and community-based organizations to make it as easy as possible for older adults and people with disabilities to get their COVID and flu shots and protect their health. Additional investment in senior centers to support vaccine initiative NCOA is now making an additional investment in senior centers to support the work that they have been doing all along in reaching the older adults and people with disabilities in their communities— providing credible information, support with vaccination appointments and access, and hosting vaccination clinics. Through this initiative, NCOA will contract with up to 150 senior centers to provide a minimum of 100 COVID-19 or flu shots. Participating senior centers will receive $10,000 that can be used to support their efforts. Senior centers will be required to attend two to three webinars where NCOA will provide information and technical assistance. In addition, participating senior centers will be required to report the number of vaccinations that were administered with the support given. Funding eligibility This opportunity is available to not-for-profit or governmental senior centers that: Are NISC Affiliate Members (becoming a member of the National Institute of Senior Centers is free) Are not receiving funding already through NCOA’s Vaccine Uptake Initiative or USAging’s Aging and Disability Vaccination Collaborative Can commit to supporting the administration of a minimum of 100 COVID-19 and/or flu shots to older adults and people with disabilities How to apply Interested senior centers must complete the 'Request for Contract' as a letter of intent. NCOA will issue contracts to eligible senior centers until the funding is exhausted. View a sample contract. Once the 'Request for Contract' is received, along with the required forms, payment will be processed. For more information, register for our Senior Center Vaccine Initiative webinar on June 27, 2023 at 3 p.m. EDT. FAQ Is there a grant application? Do we need to provide a budget? No. This opportunity is a service contract. There is no additional application, budget, or financial reporting requirement. Do the vaccinations have to be given on-site? You must commit to supporting the administration of 100 COVID-19 or flu vaccinations. That can include those provided at a clinic you host and/or those administered off-site (at a community clinic, health care facility, or those delivered in a person’s home) for which you provided appointment assistance or transportation access. Does this mean 100 COVID-19 vaccinations AND 100 flu shots? No. You are committing to 100 vaccinations that can be any combination of COVID-19 and flu vaccines. One person receiving both shots would count as two vaccines. What are the reporting requirements? You will be required to send us a report when you have administered 100 vaccines and again at the end of the contract period that will include the number and type of vaccine(s) provided. We also ask that you provide us with the general demographics of the population you serve. A template for reporting will be provided. What does a service contract mean? We believe senior centers can make it as easy as possible for older adults and people with disabilities to get their shots and protect their health. And we want to make it as easy as possible for senior centers to get this support to reach even more people. That's why we've made this service contract as simple as possible.

Results are expected in the coming months. Recommended Reading February 24, 2022 News by Steve Bryson, PhD ENA, COPD Foundation Team Up on INNA-051 Antiviral Nasal Spray Respiratory viruses can have life-threatening consequences for COPD patients For patients with chronic lung diseases like COPD, respiratory viruses can be particularly harmful, driving acute worsening, or exacerbation, of existing symptoms. Viral infections can lead to significant inflammation and breathlessness, resulting in hospitalization or other life-threatening consequences for patients. In the long term, repeated exacerbations also contribute to permanent declines in lung function. Existing treatments for exacerbations include anti-inflammatory corticosteroids, but they have serious side effects with long-term use, and preventive antibiotics, which have limited efficacy against viral infections, according to Pneumagen. Many common viruses are able to enter the body’s cells by recognizing and binding to long sugar molecules called glycans on the cell’s surface. In the case of respiratory viruses, they use these molecules to enter nasal cells, where they hijack cellular machinery to replicate and spread to other cells, including those in the lungs. Self-administered directly into the nose via a spray, Neumifil is designed to stop a virus in its tracks in the nasal passages. It binds to sialic acids, the proteins found on the end of glycans that viruses interact with, as well as glycoproteins at the surface of certain viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. By doing so, Neumifil can stop the virus from entering cells, ultimately preventing infection. The company believes this mechanism — which directly targets human cells instead of the virus itself — may prevent viruses from developing a resistance to the medication, a problem often observed with directly-acting anti-virals or vaccine therapies that can render them less effective. Pneumagen is developing Neumifil as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent for the prevention and treatment of viral respiratory tract infections. “Neumifil could address a large unmet medical need by preventing virus induced exacerbations, which can be potentially lethal for some patients suffering from serious underlying respiratory disease,” said Mark Bamforth, founder of Thairm Bio, one of Pneumagen’s existing investors. Recommended Reading May 3, 2023 by Caroline Gainer How humming and nasal irrigation have helped me avoid infection Neumifil found to be safe in preclinical study and in Phase 1 trial Preclinical data have supported Neumifil’s safety and efficacy against a range of common viruses, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2, when given either as a preventive approach or to treat an existing infection. Single and multiple doses of the therapy were also found to be safe and well-tolerated in healthy volunteers in a Phase 1 trial (NCT05093530). The Phase 2a trial enrolled 104 healthy adults, ages 18-55, at a single site in London. Participants were randomly assigned to receive single or multiple doses of Neumifil or a placebo before being exposed to the influenza virus. Its main goal is to evaluate the effects of treatment on reducing the incidence and severity of influenza symptoms in the week after exposure. Safety, nasal discharge, presence of the virus in the bloodstream, and patient self-reported symptoms will also be assessed. The upcoming Phase 2b trial will include COPD patients experiencing virus-induced disease exacerbations, and will evaluate the treatment’s effects on exacerbation frequency. “We are excited to make our initial investment in Pneumagen,” said Dean Slagel, managing director at Esperante Ventures. “We were attracted by the quality of Pneumagen’s leadership and multiple milestones that Douglas and the Pneumagen team have delivered as they work to position Neumifil as a treatment option for respiratory tract infections.” About the Author Lindsey Shapiro PhD Lindsey earned her PhD in neuroscience from Emory University in Atlanta, where she studied novel therapeutic strategies for treatment-resistant forms of epilepsy.

The government of Espírito Santo state has banned, indefinitely, access to the Três Ilhas Archipelago and the other islands of the Setiba Environmental Protection Area (APA), located in the municipalities of Guarapari and Vila Velha, metropolitan region of Vitória. The measure was adopted due to the cases of avian flu reported in the state and covers a total of eight islands. The Arquipélago das Três Ilhas is formed by five islands: Quitongo, Cambaião, Guanchumbas, Leste-Oeste, and Guararema. In the other areas of the APA are the islands of Francisco Vaz, Toaninha, and Alacaeira. The joint order from the State Secretary of Environment and Water Resources and the State Institute of Environment and Water Resources was published this Thursday (8) in an extra edition of the state's Official Gazette. Espírito Santo is the state with the highest number of avian influenza cases in the country, with 20 outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) confirmed. Until then, Brazil had never recorded the occurrence of the disease in its territory. In all, 30 outbreaks in wild birds have been confirmed in the states of Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul, São Paulo, and Bahia. The majority are birds of the species Thalasseus acuflavidus (popular name of the trinta-réis-de-bando) and Thalasseus maximus (trinta-réis-real). The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock has made available a panel for consultation of confirmed cases, discarded cases, and cases under investigation. The platform can be consulted by anyone and will be updated twice a day, at 1 pm and 7 pm. This week, the federal government also opened an extraordinary credit line in favor of the Map for actions against avian flu. The ministry informed that, with the state of animal health emergency in force in the country, the control and containment actions will be intensified to prevent the disease from reaching subsistence and commercial poultry production, in addition to preserving the fauna and human health. The Map's orientation is that the population should not collect birds they find, sick or dead, and call the nearest veterinary service. Also according to the government, there are no changes in the Brazilian status of being free from highly pathogenic avian influenza before the World Organization for Animal Health, because there is no record in commercial production. Avian influenza is a highly contagious viral disease that affects mainly domestic and wild birds. It is mainly characterized by high mortality of birds that can be accompanied by clinical signs such as staggering gait, torticollis, respiratory distress, and diarrhea. The H5N1 virus does not easily infect humans, but the increase in cases recently has put health authorities around the world on alert. Human infections can occur through contact with infected birds, live or dead, or environments contaminated with respiratory secretions, blood, feces, and other fluids released in the slaughter of birds. The risk of transmission to people through properly prepared and well-cooked food is also very low. In addition, the virus does not spread easily from person to person. Despite being infrequent, in humans, avian flu can be serious, with a high mortality rate. The Butantan Institute, in São Paulo, has started to develop a vaccine against the disease out of concerns that it could become a new pandemic. (Source: Agencia Brasil) Categories: Tourism, Brazil.

More than 16.5 million Australians have not received a COVID-19 booster shot in over six months and, while some of these people may have had a bout of COVID-19 in the last six months, it is a very high figure that is sparking the AMA’s warning for the winter season. AMA President Steve Robson said Australia was facing a worrying fifth wave of COVID-19, with cases soaring to an average of 5517 per day as of May 30 — more than double the average daily rate in March. Hospitalisations are up and weekly COVID-19 related deaths are in triple figures. “The age of lockdowns and restrictions is over, so it’s understandable why many people are falling into a false sense of security, but the latest data shows the virus is infecting thousands of Australians every day,” Professor Robson said. “Now is not the time for complacency, and the AMA urges people to get up to date on their boosters, which is an extremely effective way to protect yourself and your loved ones.” The effects of the latest COVID-19 wave are being worsened by a rising number of influenza cases. The Department of Health and Aged Care recorded 17,277 flu cases between May 15–28, which was more than double the previous fortnight’s total. Professor Robson said COVID-19 boosters and flu shots were separate vaccines that could be safely administered at the same time. “We are seeing a significant spike in the number of flu and COVID cases, making this a potentially dangerous winter, particularly for elderly and immunocompromised people,” he said. “Having a COVID-19 booster and a flu shot at the same time is an effective and safe way of ensuring you are protected from both viruses.” Professor Robson also urged parents to ensure their kids were protected. “As we know, children under five years of age aren’t badly affected by COVID-19, but influenza can be extremely serious for them, so it is crucial they get their flu shots as soon as possible,” he said.

We need to do more."Dr Paul Griffin says the state should consider changing to a yellow light on the COVID traffic light system. (Supplied)COVID admissions up 10 per centQueensland Health data shows 583 beds in the state's public hospitals yesterday were needed for patients who had either flu or COVID – 210 with the flu and 373 with the pandemic virus.That equates to about 60 per cent of beds in Queensland's largest hospital, the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital.Chief Health Officer John Gerrard said COVID admissions were up almost 10 per cent in the past week.He said more than three quarters of them were among people aged 65 or older.The traffic light remains on green in Queensland despite some hospitals mandating masks. (ABC News: Curtis Rodda)Dr Gerrard said flu patient admissions in Queensland public hospitals had spiked 35 per cent compared to last week.He said a dozen flu patients were being cared for in public hospital intensive care units (ICU) yesterday."The rapid increase in sick patients admitted to hospital with influenza is of particular concern," Dr Gerrard said.More flu patients in ICUWhile more patients are being cared for in Queensland hospitals with COVID than the flu, Dr Gerrard said the number of admitted flu cases requiring ICU was 12 per cent, compared with 1.3 per cent for the pandemic virus.He implored Queenslanders to stay up to date with their flu jabs and COVID boosters this winter, to practise good hand hygiene and remain home when sick.Queensland's flu vaccination rates this year are worrying infectious disease experts.The Bundaberg Hospital has mandated masks for all staff, patients, and visitors. (ABC Wide Bay: Grace Whiteside)National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance data shows just 8.4 per cent of Queensland five to 14-year-olds; 13.8 per cent of children aged six months to four years and 15.2 per cent of 15 to 49-year-olds have been vaccinated against the flu this season."We've got very poor uptake … around the 10 per cent mark in the younger groups where over 40 per cent of our cases of flu at the moment are in 14-year-olds and less," Dr Griffin said."Levels of vaccination uptake for both viruses is a concern."That together with increasing rates for both viruses at the moment does make for what could be a really challenging time for us to manage in our health care systems."Queensland Health Minister Shannon Fentiman said poor vaccination rates were putting added pressure on already-stretched hospitals."The biggest thing you can do as a community member is get your COVID booster and get your flu shot because hopefully then you'll avoid getting really sick and having to present at emergency," she said.Newly minted state health minister Shannon Fentiman says Queenslanders can protect their community by getting the shots. (ABC News: Chris Gillette)President of the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine Claire Skinner said emergency departments across Queensland were "under a lot of pressure", seeing patients in high numbers."Unfortunately, we're also seeing that those people who do come to ED are quite unwell and often need admission to a hospital inpatient unit," Dr Skinner said."We're here to help you if you need us, but there are some things you could do to help us as well, like trying to keep your viruses to yourself, like staying away from other people if you're feeling unwell and also making sure that you're up to date with your flu and your COVID vaccines," she said.Dr Clare Skinner says hospitals are feeling the pressure of flu season.

warn bird flu virus changing rapidly in largest ever outbreak Published 1 year ago on June 4, 2023 By Ariana News The virus causing record cases of avian influenza in birds across the world is changing rapidly, experts have warned, as calls increase for countries to vaccinate their poultry. While emphasizing that the risk to humans remains low, the experts who spoke to AFP said that the surging number of bird flu cases in mammals was a cause for concern. Since first emerging in 1996, the H5N1 avian influenza virus had previously been confined to mostly seasonal outbreaks. But "something happened" in mid-2021 that made the group of viruses much more infectious, according to Richard Webby, the head of a World Health Organization collaborating center studying influenza in animals. Since then, outbreaks have lasted all year round, spreading to new areas and leading to mass deaths among wild birds and tens of millions of poultry being culled, AFP reported. Webby, who is a researcher at St Jude Children's Research Hospital in the US city of Memphis, told AFP it was "absolutely" the largest outbreak of avian influenza the world had seen. He led research, published this week in the journal Nature Communications, showing how the virus rapidly evolved as it spread from Europe into North America. The study said the virus increased in virulence, which means it causes more dangerous disease, when it arrived in North America. The researchers also infected a ferret with one of the new strains of bird flu. They found an unexpectedly "huge" amount of the virus in its brain, Webby said, indicating it had caused more serious disease than previous strains. Emphasizing that the risk in humans was still low, he said that "this virus is not being static, it's changing". "That does increase the potential that even just by chance" the virus could "pick up genetic traits that allow it to be more of a human virus," he said. In rare cases, humans have contracted the sometimes deadly virus, usually after coming in close contact with infected birds. The virus has also been detected in a soaring number of mammals, which Webby described as a "really, really troubling sign". Last week Chile said that nearly 9,000 sea lions, penguins, otters, porpoises and dolphins have died from bird flu along its north coast since the start of the year, AFP reported. Most mammals are believed to have contracted the virus by eating an infected bird. But Webby said that what "scares us the most" are indications from a Spanish mink farm, or among sea lions off South America, that the virus could be transmitting between mammals. Ian Brown, virology head at the UK's Animal and Plant Health Agency, said there has not yet been "clear evidence that this virus is easily sustaining in mammals." While the virus is changing to become "more efficient and more effective in birds," it remains "unadapted to humans," Brown told AFP. Avian viruses bind to different receptors on the host cell than human viruses, Webby said. It would take "two or three minor changes in one protein of the viruses" to become more adapted to humans, he said. "That is what we're really looking out for." Vaccinating poultry One way to bring down the number of total bird flu cases, and therefore reduce the risk to humans, would be for countries to vaccinate their poultry, Webby said. A few nations including China, Egypt and Vietnam have already held vaccination campaigns for poultry. But many other countries have been reluctant due to import restrictions in some areas, and fears vaccinated birds that nonetheless get infected could slip through the net. In April, the United States started testing several vaccine candidates for potential use on birds. France recently said it hopes to start vaccinating poultry as early as autumn this year. Christine Middlemiss, the UK's chief veterinary officer, said that vaccinating poultry was not "a silver bullet because the virus changes constantly". But traditionally reluctant countries should consider vaccinating poultry more often, Middlemiss told AFP at an event at the UK's embassy in Paris last week. World Organisation for Animal Health director general Monique Eloit said that the issue of vaccinating poultry should be "on the table". After all, "everyone now knows that a pandemic is not just a fantasy -- it could be a reality," she added.

UNICEF said of the 6.1 million people who accessed essential health and nutrition services, half of them were children under the age of five. In addition, 50 schools in 10 provinces gained access to safe water, handwashing facilities, and newly constructed or rehabilitated toilet facilities. However, as of September, UNICEF’s Humanitarian Action for Children (HAC) appeal for children in Afghanistan is only 41 percent funded. Afghanistan remains one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises, with 23.7 million people in need of humanitarian assistance following decades of conflict, extreme climate shocks, and severe economic decline. UNICEF also stated that this year, 33 percent of the population receives most of their income from unsustainable income sources, compared to 26 percent in 2023. Continue Reading Health Polio vaccination campaign kicks off in Afghanistan Published 2 weeks ago on October 28, 2024 By Ariana News Public Health Ministry officials have confirmed that a polio vaccine campaign across 16 provinces was launched on Monday. Sharaft Zaman Amarkhil, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Public Health, says that the campaign got underway on Monday in a number of provinces including Kabul, Kandahar, Helmand, Uruzgan, Zabul, Farah, Nangarhar, Laghman, Kunar, Nuristan and some other provinces. Amarkhil said the campaign will last for three days and an estimated 6.2 million children under the age of five will receive the anti-polio vaccine. Zaman called on parents, religious scholars and ethnic elders to cooperate with the ministry's vaccinators in implementing the anti-polio vaccination campaign for children under five years old in the mentioned provinces. The World Health Organization meanwhile published its latest Polio Bulletin on Monday and confirmed Afghanistan has recorded 23 cases of Wild Polio Virus so far this year. Pakistan meanwhile reported two new cases this week - one in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the other in Balochistan province. Pakistan has recorded a total of 41 cases of polio so far this year, bringing the total between the two countries to 64, against last year’s total of 12 (Afghanistan 6 and Pakistan 6). World Polio Day Marking World Polio Day last week, UNICEF pointed out that the current data issues a stark warning that the life-threatening disease continues to thrive in areas where conflict, natural disasters, humanitarian crises, and other destabilizing factors make it difficult to deliver critical healthcare. “In conflict, children face more than bombs and bullets; they are at risk of deadly diseases that should no longer exist,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. “In many countries, we are witnessing the collapse of healthcare systems, destruction of water and sanitation infrastructure, and the displacement of families, triggering a resurgence of diseases like polio. Children are being left paralyzed, unable to walk, play, or attend school." A global decline in childhood immunization has also led to an increase in polio outbreaks, including in countries that had been polio-free for decades. Nowhere is this more evident than in conflict-affected areas, with 15 out of 21 such countries – including Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, South Sudan, and Yemen – currently battling polio. In recent months, UNICEF and partners have intensified emergency responses to surges in polio outbreaks. In Gaza, for example, UNICEF, in partnership with WHO, reached nearly 600,000 children under 10 years during the first round of a polio vaccination campaign in mid-September. The second and final round has been successfully implemented in south and central Gaza, but renewed mass displacement and bombings have delayed the process in the north. The campaign follows the return of polio to Gaza for the first time in 25 years.

Published 3 weeks ago on October 23, 2024 By Ariana News The Afghanistan Independent Journalists Union (AIJU) says it has signed a three-year memorandum of understanding (MoU) with a private hospital in Kabul to provide discounted health services to journalists. The MoU was signed during a ceremony in Kabul on Tuesday, between Hojatullah Mujadadi, the head of the union, and the director of the private hospital Abdullah Yousafzai. Mujadadi welcomed the move and said this was part of the union’s efforts to ensure media workers are provided with adequate health services.
