In November 2022 HPAI arrived in Peru, triggering massive pelican and sea lion die-offs. We report genomic characterization of HPAI/H5N1 in five species of marine mammals and seabirds (dolphins, sea lions, sanderlings, pelicans and cormorants). Peruvian viruses belong to lineage 2.3.4.4b, but they are 4:4 reassortants where 4 genomic segments (PA, HA, NA and MP) position within the Eurasian lineage that initially entered North America from Eurasia, while the other 4 genomic segments (PB2, PB1, NP and NS) position within the American lineage (clade C) that circulated in North America. These viruses are rapidly accruing mutations, including mutations of concern, that warrant further examination and highlight an urgent need for active local surveillance to manage outbreaks and limit spillover into other species, including humans.

The H5N1 (clade 2.3.4.4b) virus arrived in North America in late 2021 from Eurasia and spread across the continent in wild birds, spilling over into poultry farms and infecting an alarming number of wild terrestrial mammals, including fox, skunk, bear, bobcat, and raccoon6,7,8. In October 2022, an apparent mink-to-mink transmission of clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 viruses in Spain9 further heightened concern that the avian virus was adapting to mammals and that an H5N1 global pandemic in humans could be approaching.In November 2022, Peruvian pelicans (Pelecanus thagus) along the coast and in offshore islands began experiencing a mass die-off10,11. HPAI A/H5N1 was identified in samples collected from dead birds, resulting in the country declaring a sanitary alert10. This was followed by several spillover events into other domestic and wild birds, including zoo animals and wild raptors4,11. By the beginning of 2023, the Peru outbreak had spread to marine mammals, particularly affecting the South American sea lion (Otaria flavescens), which also began to experience a mass die-off12.The Pacific coast of Peru hosts a rich biodiversity of marine mammals and seabirds13. The ecosystem is home to large populations of South American sea lion, “guano birds” like the Guanay cormorant (Phalacrocorax bougainvillii), the Peruvian booby (Sula variegata) and the Peruvian pelican, and endangered birds like the Humboldt penguin (Spheniscus humboldti). The region also serves as stopover points and feeding grounds for diverse avian migratory species, including the Franklin’s gull (Leucophaeus pipixcan) and several species of sandpipers (Calidris spp.)14,15 that travel south from the northern hemisphere during the boreal winter. Endemic avian influenza A viruses circulate in birds in Peru16, including unusual reassortant viruses with combinations of genes from the dominant “American” lineage that is widespread in North America and the “South American” lineage that is commonly found in waterfowl in Argentina and Chile17,18. However, HPAI viruses of Eurasian origin that caused a major US outbreak in 2014–201519 never reached Peru and, to our knowledge, the 2022–2023 HPAI outbreak in South America represents the first incursion of HPAI in the region.Here we report detection, genomic characterisation, phylogenetic analysis, and mutation analysis of HPAI A/H5N1 viruses identified in marine mammals (sea lion and common dolphin) and seabirds (pelican, cormorant and sanderling) sampled along the coast of Peru since November 2022.ResultsDetection of HPAI positive samples in mammals and seabirds in PeruIn response to a multi-species outbreak starting in November 2022, we collected 69 swabs of external orifices and internal organ tissues from seven species of marine mammals and seabirds (common dolphin (Delphinus delphis), South American sea lion (Otaria flavescens), sanderling (Calidris alba), Peruvian pelican (Pelecanus thagus), Guanay cormorant (Phalacrocorax bougainvillii), Peruvian gull (Larus belcheri) and Humboldt penguin (Spheniscus humboldti)) in regions representing the northern (Piura), central (Lima) and southern (Arequipa and Tacna) coast of Peru (Supplementary Table 1, Fig. 1A). All animals sampled were either deceased or manifested clear signs of disease, including respiratory, digestive, and/or neurological symptoms indicative of acute encephalitis. Seabirds exhibited disorientation, ataxia, circling, nystagmus, torticollis, congested conjunctivae and dyspnea; sea lions exhibited disorientation, ataxia, circling, “stargazing” posture, copious nasal discharge, sialorrhea, dyspnea and seizures; the dolphin was found recently deceased.Fig. 1: Collection sites and animals sampled.A Map of Peru showing collection sites representative of the northern, central and southern regions. Mass die-offs of both birds and mammals occurred along the entire coast of Peru, but map only shows positive locations of animals samples in this study. B Photographic record of animals sampled, including common dolphin, South American sea lion, sanderling, Guanay cormorant, Peruvian booby and Peruvian pelican.Full size imageTo date, we have tested 69 samples from a total of 28 individuals by RT-qPCR, confirming 11 individuals (1 dolphin, 4 sea lions and 6 seabirds), plus 1 pooled sample from 5 sea lions, as positive for influenza A. All samples were also tested for coronaviruses, alphaviruses, bunyaviruses and flaviviruses using pan-PCR assays, and all samples were negative for these tests. Influenza A positives were subjected to NGS for subtyping and to generate full genomes for phylogenetic and mutational analysis. We confirmed 11 individuals as positive for HPAI A/H5N1 (1/1 dolphin, 3/4 individual sea lions, 1/1 pooled sample from 5 sea lions and 6/6 seabirds). It was not possible to type the remaining positive sea lion, as the sample contained very low viral loads or extensive signs of nucleic acid degradation (Supplementary Table 1), likely associated with extensively decomposed tissues in deceased animals (Fig. 1B). Of the 11 individuals that yielded quality sequence data, we generated complete sequences for most genomic regions in most samples (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1). All sequences have been deposited in GenBank (Accession Numbers OQ550419-OQ550478, and OQ925704-OQ925729).Table 1 Eleven Peruvian HPAI A/H5N1 genomes sequenced in this studyFull size tableEurasian-American lineage reassortantsTo further characterise our Peruvian HPAI A/H5N1 isolates we carried out phylogenetic analyses for each genome segment separately, using all HPAI A/H5N1 reference sequences available globally for avian and mammalian H5 viruses submitted to GISAID since January 1, 2021, including the original A/H5N1 goose/Guangdong strain identified in 199620. Our analysis confirms that all samples sequenced are closely related and cluster within the HPAI A/H5N1 lineage 2.3.4.4b, and further, that the eight Peruvian HPAI A/H5N1 viruses are reassortants (Figs. 2 and 3). Peruvian viruses are positioned in the Eurasian lineage in trees inferred for the PA, HA, NA and MP segments, and cluster within the large clade of North American viruses that were first introduced from Eurasia to the North American’s Atlantic flyway in late 2021 (Fig. 2). In contrast, Peruvian viruses are positioned in the American lineage for trees inferred for the PB2, PB1, NP and NS segments, which is evidence of a 4:4 reassortment event. Most of the H5N1 viruses observed since the summer of 2022 in the Americas are reassortants containing various combinations of segments from the Eurasian and American lineages (Fig. 3). The Eurasian lineage H5N1 virus that originally invaded North America in 2021 has reassorted multiple times with the endemic American lineage since arriving in North America, as evidenced by multiple reassortant clades positioned within the American lineage (Fig. 2). The Peru viruses are positioned in clade C on the PB2, PB1, NP and NS trees and their 4:4 reassortment pattern is referred to as “R6” (Fig. 3).Fig. 2: Global H5N1 phylogenies for all eight genome segments.Phylogenetic trees for AIVs collected globally and submitted to GISAID since January 1, 2021, inferred using ML methods. Branches shaded by AIV lineage; tips shaded by AIV subtype and location. H5N1 viruses from the 2021–2023 Western hemisphere outbreak are shaded yellow, South American H5N1 viruses (except Peru) are shaded green, and Peruvian H5N1 viruses are shaded pink. Cartoon animals denote notable outbreaks in mink in Spain, sea lions in Peru, and seals in Maine, USA. A detailed tree is provided for the PB2 segment, including bootstrap values, labels, and a box around the R6 reassortant clade that is presented in greater detail in Fig. 3A. Smaller trees are provided for the other 7 segments. Raw tree files for each genome segment are available at GitHub (https://github.com/mostmarmot/Peru_AIV/).Full size imageFig. 3: H5N1 genotypes identified in the Americas, 2021–2023.Each genotype box represents one of eight genome segments (1–8), shaded by lineage: grey = Eurasian lineage; pink = American lineage (clade A); blue = American lineage (clade B); green = American lineage (clade C); orange = American lineage (clade D).Full size imageR6 reassortants were first detected in North American poultry in March 2022 (e.g., EPI_ISL_11971482|Aurkey/South Dakota/22-008485-002/2022) (Fig. 4A), spread regionally across the central United States during the spring and summer of 2022 (Fig. 4B), and became the dominant genotype among sequenced H5N1 viruses in the Americas during the autumn of 2022 (Fig. 4C). The population genetics of H5N1 in the Americas underwent a shift during 2022, as reassortants displaced the original non-reassortant Eurasian H5N1 virus, which has not been detected in the Western hemisphere since June 2022. All currently detected H5N1 reassortants in the Western hemisphere still retain Eurasian HA, NA, and MP segments, but their PB2 and NP segments belong to the American lineage. Both Eurasian and American lineages continue to co-circulate in the Americas for the PB1, PA, and NS segments in various reassortant backgrounds (Fig. 3). Viruses isolated from poultry in Colombia and Ecuador21 in November 2022 (e.g., A/chicken/Ecuador/02/2022) have the same R6 reassortant genotype as the Peru viruses that were also first detected in November 2022. However, the South America H5N1 viruses are not monophyletic (Fig. 4A) and represent at least four independent viral introductions from North American birds migrating to South American countries during fall migration (1 introduction to Ecuador, 1 introduction to Chile/Peru (see below), and 2 introductions to Colombia). The H5N1 viruses isolated from pelicans in Venezuela in November 2022 have a different reassortant genotype (R7) that is primarily found in the eastern US, including in Florida, and represents a fifth independent H5N1introduction from North to South America during the fall of 2022 (Fig. 3).Fig. 4: Spread of reassortant “R6” viruses.A Time-scaled maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree inferred for the PB2 segment using Bayesian approaches for 98 representative H5N1 viruses (R6 genotype) belonging to the reassortant clade C in the American lineage (see Fig. 2).

C Proportion of H5N1 viruses sequenced in the Americas between 2021–2023 that belong to different genotypes (Fig. 2) over time.Full size imageH5N1 viruses from Peru and Chile with the R6 genotype form a single clade, representing the only phylogenetic evidence of H5N1 spread between two South American countries to date (Fig. 4A). The Peru-Chile clade appears to descend from a single viral introduction from North America, estimated to have occurred during October 2022 (95% HPD, September 05, 2022 to October 23, 2022). Whether the introduction from North America first arrived in Peru or Chile is difficult to infer from the tree, since the posterior probabilities are similar for both locations at this node (0.41 for Peru; 0.47 for Chile). Within the Peru-Chile clade, the H5N1 viruses collected from northern Peru (Piura region) and central Peru (Lima region) cluster together, consistent with transmission in Peru between avian and mammalian species (pelican, cormorant, sandpiper, dolphin and sea lion). However, two H5N1 viruses collected from sea lions in southern Peru (Arequipa region) during the latter phases of the outbreak cluster with Chilean viruses, reflecting instances of viral gene flow across Peru’s southern border. Both of these viruses have the PB2 D701N mutation that is associated with enhanced mammalian transmission in mammals (see below), however, these Arequipa viruses were collected in sea lions a month apart (February 7, 2023 vs. March 6, 2023) and they do not cluster together on the same phylogenetic trees. One of the Arequipa viruses (A/South American sea lion/PeruAQP-SER00R/2023) with the D701N mutation clusters on the PB2 tree with the H5N1 virus isolated from a human in Chile22 a few weeks later (March 24, 2023) that also has the D701N mutation (Figs. 4A and 5), but this pattern does not hold for trees inferred using other genome segments. Taken together, these data provide evidence that the D701N mutation is emerging repeatedly in H5N1 viruses that infect mammalian hosts along South America’s Pacific coast, however, these data cannot yet ascertain whether viruses with this mutation are transmitting within mammals.Fig. 5: SNP and mutational analysis of Peruvian HPAI a/H5N1 viruses (shown in bold).Additional reference sequences used are available through GenBank and GISAID. A total of 22 variable sites across genomic segments were identified relative to the original A/H5N1 goose/Guangdong reference from 1996, the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 reference used to annotate amino acid positions in the CDC inventory23, plus two additional more recent references representing R6 reassortants from 2022 identified in birds (chicken/wyoming/2022) and mammals (skunk/washington/22-019274-001/2022) (shaded in grey). Mutation PB2 D701N (shown with an *) has been previously linked to mammalian host adaptation and enhanced transmission24,25. The remaining 21/22 sites have not been previously characterised, and 4 may warrant special consideration (shown in bold) as they are concentrated in recent mammalian samples (Supplement Table 2), including 2 (PB2 D701N and PA M86I) that later show up in the genome sequenced from the human case in Chile (A/Chile/25946/2023)22. Dots represent amino acids identical to those present in annotation reference A/Goose/Guangdong/1/96; colours have been randomly assigned to amino acids simply to aid in identification of differences; X indicates there is no genomic information available for that position; - - indicates a deletion in the sequence.Full size imageMutation analysisWe also performed a detailed SNP and mutational analysis to identify amino acid changes potentially linked to increased virulence, transmission, or mammalian host adaptation, and to assess if we could identify specific differences between host species (mammals vs. birds). We focused on variable sites that were different from both the original A/H5N1 goose/Guangdong strain from 199620 and the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 strain used to annotate amino acid positions in the CDC inventory23. Based on these criteria, we identified more than 70 variable sites spread across all genomic regions (Supplementary Table 2), including 21 that have been previously reported as linked to specific phenotypes, such as altered polymerase activity and replication efficiency (usually enhanced), increased virus binding to α2–3 and α2–6, enhanced transmission, and increased virulence and pathogenicity, including in mammals23,24. However, given the increased age of the two reference sequences used to define variable sites, which would make them unsuitable to identify potentially relevant recent changes, we also included in the analysis two additional references representing R6 reassortants from 2022 identified in birds (A/chicken/Wyoming/22-032216-001/2022) and mammals (A/skunk/Washington/22-019274-001/2022). Based on this more stringent comparison, we identified 23 variable positions in Peruvian viruses that contain mutations that are not present in either the Guangdong/Vietnam reference strains from 1996/2004, or the R6 reassortants from 2022 (Fig. 5, Supplementary Table 2). Within this group, 15 mutations are present in all birds and mammals from Peru (3 cases) or present in single individuals from Peru (12 cases). The remaining 8 sites are of particularly high interest because they repeat two or more times. These sites include 1 in PB2 (D701N), 1 in PB1 (S515A), 3 in PA (R57Q, T85V, M86I), 1 in HA (H355R, according to the H5 numbering scheme), 1 in NP (Y289F) and 1 in NA (A81I), and half of them cluster solely in mammalian viruses from Peru. Particularly noteworthy is the PB2 D701N mutation, which appears in sea lion samples collected during the late phases of the outbreak in Peru in February and March, and subsequently appears in the virus sequenced from the human case reported in Chile22. This mutation, along with two other PB2 mutations (E627K, K702R) not present in our data, have been specifically linked to mammalian host adaptation and enhanced transmission previously24,25. In addition, despite not finding PB2 E627K and K702R, we have identified two additional mutations (PA M861I and NS1 D26K) in mammalian samples from Peru that are also present in the human case from Chile22, raising the possibility that the viruses are changing in a host-specific manner24,25 that supports mammalian host adaptation. The sea lion viruses contain additional unique mutations, such as PB1 L378M and S515A, that may warrant further observation, as these are also showing up in Chilean genomes, mostly from birds. Sampling of additional individuals will be needed to fully assess the significance of these uncharacterised variable sites, especially in terms of their pathogenicity to mammals. However, it is clear that most are restricted to sequences reported in Latin America (Fig. 5, Supplementary Table 2), which indicates that the virus is indeed changing, and perhaps even adapting to mammals, as it travels south from the northern hemisphere.DiscussionFor decades, South America’s relative geographic isolation has largely insulated its fragile coastal ecosystems and poultry industry from the HPAI outbreaks that periodically ravage US and Mexican farms to the north. But the newest variant of HPAI A/H5N1, clade 2.3.4.4b, is spreading faster, causing mass mortality in wildlife, infecting mammals, and invading countries like Peru that had remained HPAI-free for decades. The arrival of HPAI in regions with less experience managing highly pathogenic viruses in wildlife and poultry is highly concerning. These events should prompt immediate cross-sectoral capacity strengthening and coordinated response activities throughout the region. Here, we rapidly established new surveillance partnerships between government and academia to respond to mass mortality events involving Peruvian pelicans and South American sea lions. We confirmed the presence of HPAI A/H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b in both pelicans and sea lions, as well as in Guanay cormorants, sanderlings and dolphins, and further surmised that HPAI A/H5N1 is the likely causative agent of the mass wildlife die-offs. We suspect that direct HPAI transmission between sea lions could be occurring, rather than independent spillovers into sea lions from avian sources, but additional sequence data and analysis will be required to further characterise mammal-to-mammal transmission. We report more than 70 variable sites, many of which have been previously linked to altered polymerase activity and replication efficiency, increased virus binding to α2–3 and α2–6, enhanced transmission, and increased virulence and pathogenicity, including in mammals23,24,26, but we specifically focus on 23 sites that are different even from R6 resassortants that circulated in 2022. Within this subset we are particularly concerned by the presence of PB2 D701N in 2 sea lion samples, and in a human case reported in Chile22, as this mutation has been specifically linked to mammalian host adaptation and enhanced transmission24,25. The same concern applies to PA M861I and NS1 D26K, which are present in mammalian samples from Peru and in the human case from Chile22. Two other mutations of concern (PB2 E627K and K702R), linked to mammalian host adaptation and enhanced transmission24,25, as well as the PB2 T271A mutation observed in the mink outbreak in Spain9, were not present in our samples. Our analysis has focused on recent non-synonymous mutations, however, other mutations, including synonymous substitutions should be further examined, as these can change viral RNA structure and splicing, which in turn can potentially impact viral pathogenesis and fitness.Our phylogenetic analysis supports a single introduction of 2.3.4.4b into Peru from North America, presumably through the movements of migratory wild birds that travel south during the boreal winter, setting the stage for infection of local sea birds that share habitats with marine mammals. There are multiple possible transmission routes for local transmission among species that involve direct contact or indirect environmental transmission. For one, seabirds share feeding spaces with both sea lions and dolphins, providing ample opportunities for direct contact between animals at sea27,28,29,30. Direct contact also occurs on islands, islets, and guano headlands, especially in protected areas where large and dense breeding colonies of sea lions and seabirds cohabitate, and where indirect transmission is also possible on land and via guano runoff into the surrounding waters27,28,30,31. Another scenario for transmission involves carnivory and scavenging of infected animal carcasses by marine and terrestrial carnivores, as well as by raptors, gulls, and other scavenger birds2,32,33. Fishing docks, where fishermen often dispose of waste by dumping it at sea, attract seabirds, sea lions, marine otters and others that come to feed. Many docks along the Peruvian coast also function as tourist attractions, where seabirds and sea lions are purposely fed to create photo opportunities, building large congregations of wild animals that also increase opportunities for contact with humans. The confirmed presence of HPAI A/H5N1 in 2 species of resident guano seabirds, the Peruvian pelican and Guanay cormorant, provides another potential route for future transmission to humans34,35, as guano is widely used to fertilise crops. Finally, the Peruvian desert coast is home to large poultry operations with millions of chickens adjacent to infected wild and migratory birds, placing this production industry at risk and furthering the potential for animal and human contact with circulating HPAI lineages in the region.There are outstanding questions about which migratory bird species are involved in the long-distance dissemination of HPAI from North to South America, possibly by way of Central America. We detected clade 2.3.4.4b in a migratory sanderling (Calidris alba) that would have arrived in Peru after breeding in the Canadian arctic. However, Calidris spp. are an unlikely conduit for HPAIV A/H5N1 because experimental inoculations result in death or disease within 5 to 11 days of inoculation36,37. Given the unlikelihood of a successful long-distance migration for a clinically infected bird, we suspect the sanderling was infected locally. Our phylogenetic analysis supports multiple independent introductions of HPAI from North America into South American countries for which sequence data was available at the time of this study, including Peru, Ecuador, and Venezuela. This contrasts with the single introduction of HPAI from Eurasia to North America observed earlier in 2021. Although North America is the primary source of HPAI for South America’s initial HPAI outbreaks, South American countries are likely to become more important sources for regional HPAI outbreaks as the virus establishes locally. After observing HPAI A/H5N1 reassort repeatedly within North American viruses, it is possible that the virus will continue to evolve in South America by mutation and reassortment with the genetically distinct South American AIV lineage that is commonly detected in Argentina17 and Chile18. For this reason, and given the uncharacterised variable sites reported here, there is an urgent need to establish pipelines for efficient real-time genomic sequencing of HPAI to track viral evolution and spread across Peru and other countries in South America, as well as funding to support characterisation of possible new mutations.The impact of HPAI A/H5N1 on the morbidity and mortality of endangered species like the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus)38, the Humboldt penguin (Spheniscus humboldti)39, the marine otter (Lontra felina)40, and many others is concerning. The Peruvian coast is one of the few places in the world where scavenger condors feed on dead marine animals41,42, putting them at risk of infection if they consume contaminated carcasses. The recent infection and death of several critically endangered California condors (Gymnogyps californianus) in the United States highlights these risks43. The Humboldt penguin lives in large colonies and shares space with guano birds and sea lions, and although the single individual tested here was not positive for HPAI A/H5N1, Chile is observing record mortality in this species, now reaching 10% of their population, with four confirmed positive to HPAI A/H5N144. Similarly, the marine otter40 is an aquatic mustelid that inhabits the same rocky shores of Peru and Chile inhabited by sea lions. HPAI A/H5N1 has been confirmed previously in otters2 and recently in two animals from Chile44, and although none were tested here, we have anecdotal knowledge of otter carcasses washing onto Peruvian shores. Fortunately, marine otters do not live in large groups45, which might limit intraspecies contagion. However, direct mammal to mammal transmission has been suggested as a possible explanation for an outbreak in a Spanish farm among breeding mink, another mustelid, though evidence of mammal-to-mammal transmission was inconclusive9. Various cases of HPAI A/H1 in mammals, like the dolphin case reported here and others in Chile44, along with the massive South American sea lion die-off in Peru supports direct mammal to mammal transmission as a possible viral dissemination route, but confirmation will require further investigations with larger samples sizes, deeper genomic analyses and epidemiologic data that are often difficult to come by in outbreak settings. Peruvian pelicans have also suffered massive die-offs at the beginning of the outbreak in Peru, later followed by Guanay cormorants and Peruvian boobies. Peruvian pelicans are considered near-threatened worldwide46, but in Peru they are classified as endangered due to recent large population declines resulting from severe El Niño events associated with global warming and overfishing of their main source of food, the Peruvian anchovy15. For these reasons, efforts are urgently needed to assess the impact of ongoing mass mortalities on Peruvian marine sea birds and mammals.Finally, an even larger concern is the possibility of spillover into human populations, as has been already documented22,47,48, followed by massive human-to-human transmission. Previous human cases have resulted in fatalities49, which has led the WHO to declare that the current zoonotic threat from HPAI A/H5N1 remains elevated and that member states should remain vigilant and consider mitigation steps to reduce human exposure50. In Peru, the outbreak occurred along the Pacific coast and during the austral summer, when many people go to the beach. It is not uncommon for beachgoers (and their pets) to interact with sick and disoriented animals without any knowledge of the risks, or for free-roaming dogs in rural and semi-rural coastal areas to encounter sick or dead animals as they scavenge for food. This has led government authorities to relocate live animals that show up in places where they do not belong, or to euthanize sick individuals and appropriately dispose of their carcasses. However, both the pelican and sea lion die-offs have been so massive that it has been very challenging for the authorities to respond in a timely manner. The recent confirmed HPAI H5N1 human case in Chile22 has been considered an environmental exposure due to an abundance of dead wildlife in the area close to the patient’s residence, as the human virus sequenced was identical to local wild bird strains. Heightened public awareness campaigns are needed, including educating the public to avoid contact with infected animals51. Animal workers, particularly municipal personnel tasked with cleaning duties, need additional training in the proper use of personal protective equipment, and on management and disposal of infected carcasses51,52. People in contact with sick and dead animals infected with HPAI A/H5N1 are at risk of infection, and human cases could be missed in the absence of active and obvious human-to-human transmission. Syndromic surveillance based on PCR-based diagnostics and/or serology of suspected cases in people working in wildlife and poultry outbreak response is highly recommended for early detection of zoonotic transmission. Subsequent serologic studies of people in close contact with infected animals, especially in outbreak settings, can also inform on the extent of zoonotic spillover and direct future surveillance at important animal-human interfaces. This approach promotes opportunities to strengthen ties among governmental institutions at all levels, expert researchers within academia, and the larger scientific community operationalizing a One Health approach, which are essential for epidemic and pandemic preparedness. The work reported here exemplifies such collaboration, and although many of the variable genomic sites identified in Peruvian H5N1 viruses will need further validation with both downstream in-vitro and in-vivo studies, this study of HPAI A/H5N1 in marine birds and mammals in Peru represents a significant contribution to the understanding of a highly pathogenic virus with serious pandemic potential for humans.MethodsSample collection and pre-processing for influenza AStarting on November 22, 2022, samples were collected opportunistically from both live and dead animals by trained veterinarians from the Peruvian wildlife service (Servicio Nacional Forestal y de Fauna Silvestre, SERFOR) and the NGO Wildlife Conservation Society Perú, under permit 2023-009134, using full personal protective equipment and following standard protocols for cleaning, disinfection, and disposal of hazardous waste52. Some severely clinically ill animals were humanely euthanized53. Briefly, animals were chemically immobilised by intramuscular administration of ketamine and xylazine, followed by intravenous or intracardiac injection of T-61TM (MSD Animal Health USA)53. Samples and tissues were collected into cryovials containing 0.5 mL of DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo R1200 125) or viral transport media (VTM), and transported at 4 °C within 1–10 days of collection to the laboratory for testing. Nucleic acids were extracted using Quick-DNA/RNA Viral Extraction Kits (Zymo D7021) and tested for influenza A by RT-qPCR using CDC protocols54 on a Bio-Rad CFX96 instrument.Influenza A subtypingSamples positive for influenza A by RT-qPCR were subtyped using a combination of directed amplification with universal primers targeting conserved genomic regions55,56,57, followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). All primer sequences used are provided in Supplementary Table 3. Briefly, RNA samples were reverse transcribed using Superscript IV (Invitrogen 18090050) and amplified using Q5 High-fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB M0491L). Amplification products were prepared into barcoded sequencing libraries using DNA Prep Kits (Illumina 20060059) and Nextera DNA UD Indexes (Illumina 20027215). The resulting libraries were quality controlled using High Sensitivity DNA kits (Agilent 5067–4626) on a Bioanalyzer 2100 instrument. Libraries were normalised to 4 nM each, pooled, re-quantified using Qubit 1x dsDNA HS Kits (Invitrogen Q33230), and sequenced using High Output Sequencing Kits (Illumina FC-420-1003) on an Illumina MiniSeq instrument.Bioinformatics processingIllumina paired-end raw sequence data was pre-processed to trim sequencing adaptors and filter out low quality/low complexity reads (Phred scores <Q20, 75 bp minimum length) using Geneious Prime 2023.0.4 and BBDuk58. Pre-processed reads were then filtered by reference-mapping to various HA (H1, H2, H3, H5, H7) and NA (N1, N2, N3, N5, N7) references (Accession Numbers: NC_026433.1, NC_007374.1, NC_007366.1, NC_007362.1, NC_026425.1, AF144304.1, NC_007382.1, OP806485, MF046172.2, OP723829.1), and to single references in the case of all other segments (Accession Numbers MT624412.1, MN254461.1, KY635563.1, MT825070.1, MW110227.1, MT982385.1). Filtered reads were then re-assembled de-novo using SPAdes59 to generate complete genomes whenever possible, and to further confirm subtyping by BLAST. All sequences have been deposited in GenBank (Accession Numbers OQ550419-OQ550478, and OQ925704-OQ925729).Phylogenetic and mutation analysisHPAI H5N1 reference sequences were obtained from GenBank and GISAID, and together with the sequences generated here, they were concatenated and aligned using MAFFT60. Maximum likelihood (ML) trees were prepared with FastTree61 incorporating a general time-reversible (GTR) model of nucleotide substitution with gamma-distributed rate variation among sites. Trees were annotated using the WHO/OIE/FAO nomenclature for highly pathogenic avian influenza A H562. To place the Peruvian viruses in a global context, we downloaded (on February 14, 2023) an additional background dataset of influenza A virus genomes that included all sequences from avian and mammalian H5 viruses submitted to GISAID since January 1, 2021. To keep the dataset up to date, additional South American sequences were added on April 21, 2023. Partial sequences were excluded. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred for each of the eight genome segments using the ML methods available in IQ-Tree 263 with a GTR model and a gamma distribution as described above. Due to the size of the dataset, we used the high-performance computational capabilities of the Biowulf Linux cluster at the National Institutes of Health (http://biowulf.nih.gov). To assess the robustness of each node, a bootstrap resampling process was performed with 1000 replicates. Finally, mutation analysis was done using the CDC H5N1 genetic changes inventory for SNP analysis and various other previously published mutations of concern23,24.Bayesian analysisTo examine the evolution of the clade of reassortant R6 viruses in Peru and other locations in greater detail, we performed a time-scaled Bayesian analysis on a dataset of 98 PB2 sequences from the R6 clade. The dataset included all South American sequences, all mammalian sequences, and a representative subsample of North American avian sequences, including one representative virus from each cluster of viruses from the same US or Canadian state that were sampled from the same avian species on the same date. We used the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method available in the BEAST package, v1.10.464, again using the NIH Biowulf Linux cluster, and a Bayesian non-parametric (SkyGrid) demographic model65, with a GTR model of nucleotide substitution with gamma-distributed rate variation among sites. Each tip was assigned a location state and we performed a phylogeographic discrete trait analysis66 to examine the routes of viral spatial dissemination between North America and South America, within South America, and within Peru. The MCMC chain was run separately four times for each dataset using the BEAGLE 367 library to improve computational performance, until all parameters reached convergence, as assessed visually using Tracer v.1.7.268. At least 10% of the chain was removed as burn-in, and runs for the same dataset were combined using LogCombiner v1.10.4. A MCC tree was summarised using TreeAnnotator v.1.10.4 and visualised in FigTree v1.4.4. SPREAD 469 was used to visualise the spatial-temporal reconstruction. XMLs, MCC and ML trees, and GISAID acknowledgement tables are available in a GitHub repository (https://github.com/mostmarmot/Peru_AIV/).Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Avian Influenza Found in Seals on Marrowstone Island in Puget Sound September 08, 2023 Test results confirm H5N1; officials urge beachgoers to avoid contact with wildlife. Feature Story | West Coast Healthy harbor seals in a tide pool along the coast of Washington State. Puget Sound seal populations are considered healthy. Credit: Sophie McCoy, UNC The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories has confirmed that three adult harbor seals in Puget Sound have tested positive for the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1 strain. The seals stranded on Marrowstone Island on August 18 and 25. This confirms initial testing by the Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, which indicated the presence of H5N1 in these seals. No seal pups have tested positive. This marks the first incidence of HPAI in marine mammals on the West Coast. This discovery follows an ongoing HPAI outbreak affecting seabirds on Rat Island and Marrowstone Island since mid-summer. The outbreak resulted in the death of approximately 1,700 birds. The Islands are next to each other in the northern portion of Puget Sound, Washington. Fort Flagler State Park is on the northern tip of Marrowstone Island. Avoid Contact with Wildlife People and their pets should avoid all contact with sick or dead wildlife. HPAI is a “zoonotic disease” that has the potential to spread between animals and people (and their pets). Although the risk of infection to the general public remains low, beachgoers should not touch live or dead seals or allow pets to approach seals. They should maintain a safe distance of 100 yards. The emergence of avian influenza in harbor seals and gray seals in Maine last year caused a spike in deaths over a short time period. That led NOAA Fisheries to declare an unusual mortality event to investigate the incident. Avian Influenza and Seals Puget Sound harbor seal populations number in the many thousands and are considered healthy. The disease is not expected to affect the species at a population level. “The discovery of HPAI H5N1 in seals brings to light the potential for cross-species transmission and highlights the complexity of managing infectious diseases in wildlife populations,” says Kristin Wilkinson, NOAA Fisheries’ Regional Stranding and Entanglement Coordinator. “As the investigation continues, the collaboration among agencies remains essential to understanding and addressing this situation.” Seals have been diagnosed with influenza before. In the late 1970s, the virus was detected in harbor seals in the Northeast United States, and again in the early 1980s. In the early 1990s, several seals died of pneumonia in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Outside of the United States, the disease has been found in dead seals in Canada, Russia, the United Kingdom and several countries in South America. Report Sick Animals If you encounter sick, injured, or dead seals, call the West Coast Region Stranding Hotline: (866) 767-6114. Do not attempt to move sick wild animals as this can spread the disease. The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife asks members of the public to report sick or dead wild birds using this online form. As resources are available, biologists may respond to collect data and samples from carcasses. Stranding network personnel are taking precautions and wearing personal protective equipment when collecting samples from dead or live animals to ensure the safety of staff and other species. NOAA Fisheries, in collaboration with marine mammal stranding network partners and governmental agencies, continues to investigate the incidents, and monitor the progress of the virus. The investigation provides an opportunity to learn more about the potential spillover of influenza viruses from avian species to marine mammals and the implications for the broader ecosystem.

CDC Update September 7, 2023—A new CDC study shows the number of reported avian influenza (AI) "bird flu" outbreaks in animals and infections in people are increasing worldwide. During 2013–2022, bird flu outbreaks in animals and infections in people not only increased in numbers but also were detected over a growing geographic area as well as among a growing number of different animal categories. These findings are particularly relevant given ongoing H5 bird flu outbreaks globally and in the United States among commercial and backyard poultry and wild birds and sporadically in some mammals, with one reported human case in the United States and others reported internationally. Study authors looked at bird flu outbreaks in animals globally reported to the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) and other animal health authorities and bird flu infections in people reported to the World Health Organization during 2013–2022. They compared these findings with reports submitted during 2005–2012. Study findings include: The number of reported bird flu outbreaks in animals increased. Animal categories with bird flu outbreaks included wild birds, captive birds, birds in live bird markets, backyard and commercial poultry and non-human mammals, such as mink. From January 2013 to June 2022, there were reports of 34 bird flu virus subtypes during more than 21,000 bird flu outbreaks in animals and 2,000 human infections with bird flu viruses globally. On average 42 member states reported AI outbreaks in animals each year. On average, four member-states reported human AI virus infections each year. In total, 16 new bird flu subtypes were detected; 10 of these were new highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus subtypes identified in animals, including birds (almost double the number of subtypes identified during the previous eight years). Six low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) virus subtypes identified in animals, including birds, were reported for the first time during 2013–2022. Four HPAI H5 virus subtypes accounted for almost 90% of reported animal outbreaks: H5N1 (47%), H5N8 (32%), H5N2 (6%), H5N6 (4%). H5N8 was the virus subtype that accounted for the most global animal outbreaks each year since 2017, except during 2019 and 2022. During 2013–2022, 26 member-states reported their first animal AI outbreak. Eight member-states did not report a human case prior to 2013. Bird flu viruses also moved into more animal categories. From 2016 to 2022, on average, 14% of outbreaks reported each month occurred in a new animal category, with wild birds representing the highest percentage (37%). Increases in geographic and animal category spread could be attributed to increased poultry production and commercial trade, increased exposure to wild birds through repeated annual migrations of infected birds, and changes in migration patterns because of climate change or land conversion to agricultural production. These increases could also reflect better AI virus surveillance and reporting. Spread of bird flu viruses among birds, animals and people can have important public health implications. As animal outbreaks increase, the risk of spread to people can also increase, along with opportunities for viral reassortment that can enhance transmissibility of avian influenza viruses. The most effective AI surveillance would include comprehensive surveillance, inclusive of all virus subtypes, as well as timely reporting in domestic and wild birds, humans and, ideally, non-human mammals especially pigs, as pigs can play a crucial role in novel influenza virus reassortment. Efficient and sustained transmission among people could result in a flu pandemic. While the recent detections of H5N1 bird flu in U.S. poultry and wild birds are thought to pose a low risk to the health of the general public at this time, human infections are possible. As of August 9, 2023, more than 58.7 million poultry and more than 7,100 wild birds have been affected in the United States. While only one human case of H5N1 has been found in a person in the United States, CDC continues to help monitor for additional infections among people with contact with infected birds. To date, more than 6,500 people in the United States who have had exposure to birds/poultry infected with H5N1 have been or are being monitored for symptoms. The trends highlighted in this report underscore that the reasons for concerns around bird flu are growing rather than diminishing and the importance of continued monitoring and timely reporting of bird flu in animals and humans in the United States and internationally.

The transparent area in the center of the image, revealed the viral ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) inside. (Credit: CDC/ Douglas Jordan) Sep 06, 2023 Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) have received funding to study the concept of using modified strains of probiotic bacteria – that are already part of the human gut microbiome – to stimulate the formation of antibodies against the flu virus in the body’s mucosal membranes. Respiratory viruses like influenza infect the body through mucosal membranes, and the proof-of-concept project will help evaluate whether snippets of influenza proteins – tiny fragments of the virus – could be added to two common bacterial strains to create the antibody response. Antibodies in the mucosal membranes might then complement those created by traditional intramuscular injections to head off flu infection. The research, supported by the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), will study whether or not the harmless bacteria can be successfully modified to carry snippets of a viral coat protein that could stimulate the desired response in mucosal membranes lining the gut. Beyond reducing influenza infection in the general population, improved protection against the flu could have a significant impact on the U.S. military, which wants to provide the best possible protection for its warfighters to reduce possible impacts on readiness and training from influenza outbreaks. At Georgia Tech, the project is a collaboration between researchers at the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) and the Georgia Tech School of Biological Sciences. All of the research at Georgia Tech will be done using BSL-2 facilities designed for this type of study. The award does not include research on animals or humans. “Ultimately, this could one day make vaccination programs much more effective,” said Michael Farrell, a GTRI principal research scientist. “This isn’t going to be a replacement for flu vaccines as they currently exist, but it could act as an adjuvant – something that’s done in addition to vaccination to increase the overall immune response. To benefit from it, you might take a pill like you do with probiotics now.” Using Common Probiotic Bacteria as Vehicles The project will focus on two common probiotic bacteria: Escherichia coli – a gram-negative bacterium better known as E. coli – and Lactococcus lactis, a gram-positive bacterium found in cheese, buttermilk, and other dairy food items. The researchers will attempt to coax the bacteria to express the influenza virus’ Hemagglutinin (HA) receptor protein on their outer cell surface. There, the protein would stimulate an antibody response in the gut mucosal membrane as it passes through the body’s gastrointestinal tract. “We’re using some well-established probiotic bacteria that have been utilized for dozens of years, are well vetted and safe for humans,” said Brian Hammer, an associate professor in the School of Biological Sciences who specializes in bacterial genetics. “Ultimately, the idea is to use these bacteria as a chassis to create living vaccines, since the body already tolerates them both well.” Researchers at AFRL and Georgia Tech envision that a single pill or capsule would carry the bacteria into the gastrointestinal tract to provide the necessary antibody stimulation. The bacteria would be modified so they could not reproduce, preventing them from becoming part of the body’s gut microbiome – a diverse collection of bacteria that live in the body and help carry out specific functions, including metabolizing food and modulating the immune system. “We know the human microbiome is intimately involved in human health and disease, influencing processes in ways that have both positive and negative outcomes for us,” said Richard Agans, senior research biological scientist at the U.S. Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM). “Recently, we have started to better understand how the microbiome communicates with our bodies and how we can identify, target, and promote the beneficial aspects. Currently, we are working to determine how to utilize these microbial communities to better protect our warfighters as well as the general public.” Overcoming Challenges of Manipulating Bacteria Hammer’s lab specializes in manipulating proteins of organisms such as bacteria and viruses to create novel fusions. Among the techniques available is the new CRISPR-Cas, the gene-editing technology that was the subject of a Nobel Prize in 2020, but other more traditional techniques may also be used to get the influenza surface protein where the researchers want it to be. Among the challenges ahead is that adding a new component to bacterial organisms can be difficult. “In general, bacteria have evolved with the genetic components they need to survive,” Farrell explained. “If you add something else, they may just kick it out. It’s very hard to find a neutral location in the bacterial genome where we can stably add new functionality. This is especially true for this effort, in which there will be no cointroduction of antimicrobial resistance markers.” In addition, the probiotic bacteria strains that are widely used in research as model organisms, or “lab rats,” are adapted to living in laboratory conditions. This project, however, will use natural commensal strains that co-exist in humans. That approach may make it even more challenging to add the appropriate material for expressing the viral proteins on the bacteria cell surfaces, Hammer said. “We used to perceive that genes could be shuffled around in the bacteria without much effect on them, but we’re learning now that location really matters,” he said. “One of the concerns is that tools that work on the ‘lab rat’ versions of these bacteria will not be as readily accepted by these commensals.” As part of the project, the researchers will have to show that the addition of the protein doesn’t cause instability in the bacteria, and that the modified bacteria generate the correct response when exposed to human immune cells in culture. Proof of Concept Could Lead to Broader Vaccine Therapies Beyond its importance to the military, influenza was chosen to study this adjuvant approach because a number of vaccines exist for this virus, and they have been well studied over the years. If this approach works with influenza, the combination of pill and injection might be useful for vaccines against other respiratory viruses. “If this is ultimately successful, it could be the first foray into showing that these vehicles, these probiotics, could potentially be scaled up for lots of different therapeutic uses,” said Hammer. “By customizing the cargo, this approach could be rapidly adapted to address new and emerging threats that may arise in the future.” Project Provides Student Opportunity The two-year project life was chosen because of the expected difficulty – and because another of its goals is to train a master’s degree student in the bacterial modification techniques being utilized. The Georgia Tech researchers have chosen an underrepresented minority student who holds an undergraduate degree in biology from Kennesaw State University and has worked in a commercial DNA laboratory. Katrina Lancaster will begin work on this project during fall semester, collaborating with both Hammer and Farrell – and the students and other researchers in their labs. “This student will have excellent opportunities, not only to learn the skills in the lab and take the coursework, but also to develop a rich network of connections, both in the School of Biological Sciences and at GTRI, that will be helpful in moving forward and advancing their career,” Hammer said. “It’s a really beautiful combination of components for this project.” The project is funded through the AFRL’s Minority Leaders Research Collaboration Program (ML-RCP). “Partnering with academic institutions, such as GTRI, presents great opportunities for our team to interact and work with top minds in these fields to develop better outcomes for everyone,” Agans said. “We are especially grateful for the opportunity to mentor and provide opportunities for underrepresented students with STEM aspirations. We are excited to work with GTRI in this endeavor and envision this being just the first step.” USAFSAM is part of the Air Force Research Laboratory’s 711th Human Performance Wing.

This is the first double-blind, randomized, and controlled clinical trial examining the efficacy of nasal-spraying probiotic LiveSpo Navax, which contains 5 billion of Bacillus subtilis and B. clausii spores in 5 mL, in supporting treatment of influenza viral infection in pediatric patients. We found that the nasal-spraying Bacillus spores significantly shortened the recovery period and overall treatment by 2 days and increased treatment effectiveness by 58% in resolving all ARTIs’ symptoms. At day 2, the concentrations of influenza virus and co-infected bacteria were reduced by 417 and 1152 folds. Additionally, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8, TNF-α, and IL-6 in nasopharyngeal samples were reduced by 1.1, 3.7, and 53.9 folds, respectively. Compared to the standard control group, treatment regimen with LiveSpo Navax demonstrated significantly greater effectiveness, resulting in 26-fold reduction in viral load, 65-fold reduction in bacterial concentration, and 1.1–9.5-fold decrease in cytokine levels. Overall, nasal-spraying Bacillus spores can support the symptomatic treatment of influenza virus-induced ARTIs quickly, efficiently and could be used as a cost-effective supportive treatment for respiratory viral infection in general.Clinical trial registration no: NCT05378022 on 17/05/2022.

Although influenza infection initially causes uncomplicated symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, ect, it has also been associated with other serious complications such as pneumonia, bronchitis, and respiratory failure1,2,3,4,5. According to a systematic review and meta-analysis of the global burden of seasonal influenza respiratory infections in young children, about 28,000–111,500 children under the age of 5 died as a consequence of influenza infections in 2008, of which 99% of these deaths occurred in developing countries6. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) are potential biomarkers for influenza infection because elevated levels of these pro-inflammatory cytokines in both bronchial epithelial cells and clinical patients' nasopharyngeal lavage fluid correlates with viral loads and scores of typical influenza symptoms7,8,9,10.Influenza vaccination requires annual injections, which made it difficult for young children to get effectively immunized11. Moreover, antiviral nucleotide drugs including Tamiflu (oseltamivir) are unsafe for young children and is recommended only for high-risk patients12,13,14,15. To avoid bacterial co-infection and worsening symptoms, treatment for pediatric influenza infection focuses on reducing fever, improving nutrition, and cleansing the nasal airway. Antibiotics are only prescribed when there are co-infecting pathogens, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis16,17,18. Therefore, preventing co-infection will also reduce the wide-spread use of antibiotics.Probiotics have recently emerged as promising safe candidates for supportive treatment of ARTIs, which can help reducing antibiotic dependence19. A number of clinical trials have shown that Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Bacillus coagulans GBI-30, and Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis Bb12 reduce the symptoms and prevent respiratory tract infections by modulating proinflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α while stimulating secretion of Immunoglobulin A (IgA) by mucosal lymphocytes20,21,22. However, no evidence is yet available to support the use of those probiotics in lowering the occurrence and viral loads in the nasal tract20,23,24,25. Furthermore, oral digested probiotics do not provide immediate benefits, hence are typically used as preventive care of ARTIs. As a result, alternate delivery routes are needed for the use of probiotics in treatment of ARTIs. Our recent study demonstrated that nasal-spraying Bacillus spore liquid-form probiotics (LiveSpo Navax) can rapidly and effectively relieve symptoms of ARTIs due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and exhibit strong impacts in reducing the viral load and inflammation. The finding established that administering probiotics through nasal spray could be a quick and effective symptomatic treatment for ARTIs26. Because the mechanism of interaction between Bacillus spores and virus is non-specific, our findings suggested that nasal-spraying Bacillus spores may also be effective toward other rapidly emerging RTIs viruses such as influenza virus. In the following study, we further conducted the double-blind, randomized, and controlled clinical trial examining the efficacy of LiveSpo Navax in supporting treatment of young children with acute respiratory symptoms due to influenza infection. The results demonstrated strong efficacy of LiveSpo Navax in reducing infection symptoms and supporting rapid recovery of patients.ResultsTrial design and participants’ baseline characteristicsThe trial was conducted from December 2020 to April 2022, starting with a cohort of 100 patients equally assigned into two groups: the control group who received standard care, and the Navax group who received LiveSpo Navax in addition to standard care. Each group received 3 sprays of either control 0.9% NaCl or LiveSpo Navax daily. At the end of treatment period, 48 patients in the control group and 44 patients in the Navax group were included in final analysis (Fig. 1).Figure 1Diagram showing the NCT05378022 clinical trial design and data analysis from December 2020 to April 2022.Full size imagePatients’ demographic, clinical and sub-clinical characteristics were shown in Table 1. There is no significant difference in (i) age, (ii) gender distribution, and (iii) admitted day between groups (p > 0.05). Baseline clinical and subclinical characteristics including runny nose, dry rales, moist rales, body temperature (°C), pulse oxymetry (SpO2) (%), pulse and breath (beats/min), influenza viral load and bacterial co-infection measured by real-time qPCR in nasopharyngeal samples, cardiopulmonary X-ray, total white blood cells, CRP were not substantially different between two groups before treatment (p > 0.05) (Table 2).Table 1 Demographic and clinical characteristics of influenza-infected children before, during and at the end of treatment.Full size tableTable 2 Sub-clinical characteristics of influenza-infected children before treatment and treatment therapy.Full size tableSafety and symptomatic-reducing effects of nasal-spraying Bacillus sporesDuring 5-day treatment, no abnormal changes in breathing, pulse, body temperature, and pulse oxymetry were observed upon spraying Bacillus spores. The four clinical indicators were recorded before and after spraying of LiveSpo Navax or 0.9% NaCl 3 times a day for the first 3 days of treatment. As shown in Fig. 2, breath, pulse, temperature, and SpO2 values of both groups fluctuated within only 1 and 3 beats/min, 0.1 °C, 0.5%, respectively. All participants in both groups had no symptom of local bacterial infection, or had any digestive problems such as vomiting, diarrhea and no abnormality in vital signs after the spraying procedure. The results showed that administering Bacillus spores through nasal-spraying is safe for pediatric influenza patients during the treatment period.Figure 2Clinical assessment of breath (A), pulse (B), temperature (C) and pulse oxygen (D) between before and after nasal-spraying with LiveSpo Navax (in diagonal-strip pattern) and 0.9% NaCl physiological saline (in white pattern), across 9 spraying times over 3 days. Graphs showing median values (red lines), lower-upper confidence limits (black lines), and measurements from individual patients (dots).Full size imageWe next assessed typical clinical signs of influenza infection in patients at days 2 and 5 to evaluate efficacy of Bacillus spores. At day 2, the Navax group had a statistically significant lower percentage of patients with several symptoms, including runny nose (p = 0.01), fever (p = 0.0001), dry rales (p = 0.01) compared to the Control group (Table 1). At day 5, there was no patient with runny nose (p = 0.02) and dry rales (p = 0.03) in Navax group, whereas in the Control group, there were still 10 out of 48 patients exhibiting runny nose symptoms and 12 out of 33 patients showing dry rales symptoms (Table 1). Because most patients had recovered by day 2, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of pulse oximetry or fast breath (Table 1). The median days of treatment (defined as the first day during the course of treatment when a patient no longer exhibits a particular symptom) and time-course dependent percentage (%) of patients with symptom-free status in the two groups were then analyzed and shown in Fig. 3A1–F1 and A2–F2. Patients in the Navax group experienced remarkably faster recovery, with relief from runny nose observed 1 day earlier, fever subsiding 1 day earlier, and dry and moist rales alleviating 2 days earlier compared to the Control group (Fig. 3A1–D1, p < 0.0001). Although fast breath was also recovered a day earlier with Navax treatment, the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.4340; Fig. 3F1). The recovery time of the fast pulse symptom was similar in both groups (Fig. 3E1). Furthermore, the data shown in Fig. 3G1 demonstrated that LiveSpo Navax treatment resulted in a 2-day faster improvement (p < 0.0001) for all six clinical symptoms of influenza infection in pediatric patients.Figure 3Days of treatment and percentage (%) of asymptomatic patients observed over days of treatment for symptoms: (A) runny nose; (B) fever; (C) dry rales; (D) moist rales; (E) fast pulse; (F) fast breath; and (G) all six symptoms in the Control (dashed lines) and Navax (solid lines) groups. More than five days of treatment refers to symptoms that were not resolved by day 5. Mann–Whitney test was performed to evaluate statistical significance.Full size imageWe also noted that the Days of Treatment when 50% patients are no longer symptomatic (DT50) for each symptoms as well as DT50 for all six symptoms in the Navax group were shorter compared to those of the Control group. Specifically, Navax treatment reduced DT50 for runny nose, fever, dry rales, moist rales, fast pulse, fast breath, and DT50 for all six symptoms by 40%, 50%, 60%, 60%, 20%, 10%, and 58%, respectively (Fig. 3A2–G2). Overall, nasal-spraying Bacillus spores alleviated major influenza infection symptoms 1 to 2-day earlier and with 10–60% greater effectiveness. As a result, the overall treatment duration was reduced by 2 days, and the treatment effectiveness for complete symptomatic recovery increased by 58%.Reduction in influenza viral load and concentration of co-infecting bacteria by nasal-spraying Bacillus sporesTo determine how Bacillus spores act to relieve symptoms, we measured 2△Ct values, which represent the fold changes in influenza viral loads and concentration of bacterial co-infection in nasopharyngeal samples. Assessments were performed on day 2, during which we observed significant benefit of Navax treatment in improving symptoms of influenza-infected patients. As shown in Fig. 4A,B, representative amplification curves measuring the viral load and concentration of bacterial co-infection (S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae) showed significantly lower (or not detectable) presence of viruses and bacteria at day 2 in both in Control and Navax groups. However, amplification curves in Navax shifted significantly to the higher or even non-detectable range than those in Control group, indicating that Navax more effectively reduced both influenza viral load and H. influenzae concentration. Similar results were observed in other samples of both groups (Fig. S1). Furthermore, the 2△Ct data revealed that influenza viral load in Navax group was reduced by 417-fold, which was nearly 26-fold more effective than the 16-fold reduction in Control group (p < 0.0001, Fig. 4D). Measurement of average change in bacterial co-infection showed that H. influenzae and/or S. pneumoniae concentration in the Navax group was reduced by nearly 65-fold whereas 18-fold reduction was observed in the Control group. However, due to the wide range of variables in bacterial concentration, the statistical analysis did not yield a significant result (p = 0.4702; Fig. 4E). We also measured B. subtilis and B. clausii in nasopharyngeal samples at day 2 to ensure that probiotics or 0.9% NaCl being used properly. There were strong signals in the Navax group (median Ct value of 30.18 and 33.34) and non-detectable signals in the Control group for B. subtilis and B. clausii (Fig. 4C,F), confirming that the patients were taking the correct medication. Altogether, we showed that nasal-spraying Bacillus spores increased the efficacy of standard medication therapy by substantially lowering influenza viral load.Figure 4Real-time PCR amplification curves specifically for influenza virus (A), co-infection H. influenzae (B), and B. subtilis + B. clausii (C) taken from representative nasopharyngeal sample of Control and Navax groups at day 0 and 2 of treatment; Reducing-fold levels (2△Ct) of influenza viral load (D) and concentration of co-infecting bacteria (E), and Threshold cycle (Ct) of fluorescent signals for B. subtilis and B. clausii (F) measured in nasopharyngeal samples of Control and Navax groups at day 2 compared to day 0. The Mann–Whitney test was used to calculate the median difference of these indicators in the two groups. 95% CI for median in each group and the median difference between the two groups were shown in Fig. 4D,F. The significance level of all analyzes was set at the p < 0.05.Full size imageImmune-modulatory properties of nasal-spraying Bacillus sporesNext, we examined how levels of common pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α, as well as levels of mucosal Immunoglobulin A (IgA) in nasopharyngeal samples were altered over the course of treatment. We anticipated that sprayed Bacillus spores can compete with influenza virus for interactions with nasal epithelium, resulting in a reduced systemic inflammatory response. At day 0, the levels of IL-6 and IL-8, and TNF-α in both groups were high and generally comparable (p > 0.05). After 2 days of Navax treatment, we observed that IL-6 level was markedly reduced by 53.9 folds (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 5A). Both IL-8 and TNF-α levels showed significant decrease by 1.1 (p = 0.016), 3.7 (p = 0.0001) fold, respectively (Fig. 5B,C). In Control group, although there was significant reduction in IL-6 (p = 0.0197) and TNF-α (p = 0.0175) levels, no change in IL-8 levels (p = 0.8711) was detected after 2 days of treatment. While TNF-α levels were effectively reduced to zero in both groups (Fig. 5C), IL-6, IL-8 levels exhibited 9.5-fold (p = 0.0363) and 1.1-fold (p = 0.0499) greater reduction upon Navax treatment (Fig. 5A,B).Figure 5Pro-inflammatory cytokines levels (pg/mL) (A–C) and IgA level (mg/mL) (D) in nasopharyngeal samples of Control and Navax groups at day 2 compared to day 0. The Wilcoxon test was used to calculate the median differences in IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and IgA levels at day 0 and day 2 in each group. The Mann–Whitney test was used to compared cytokine concentrations between the two groups. Only samples with measurable cytokine and IgA concentrations at day 0 were included in the statistical analysis. 95% CI for median in each group and the median difference between the two groups were shown. The significance level of all analyzes was set at the p < 0.05.Full size imageFurthermore, we evaluated how spraying Bacillus spores influences IgA levels in nasopharyngeal. We found that there was slight induction of IgA in both Control and Navax groups (Fig. 5D). However, the 1.3-fold increase in IgA level observed in Navax group is more robust, resulting in statistically significant difference between day 0 vs. day 2 (p = 0.0410). The data indicated that nasal-spraying Bacillus spores significantly decreased IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α cytokine overreacted production, and to some extend increase nasal IgA level in immunological responses to influenza infection.DiscussionThe significant prevalence of respiratory viral infections emphasizes the importance of a safe, effective, and inexpensive antiviral treatment for vulnerable patients like young children. Probiotic therapy has recently emerged as an exciting avenue supported by encouraging results from clinical trials during which the use of probiotic therapy in foods can prevent respiratory tract infections (RTIs). Bacillus probiotics can maintain their efficacy for a long time due to their ability to form heat-stable spores under starvation27,28,29. Currently, only B. subtilis and B. clausii probiotics can be made as ultra-pure, concentrated spore liquid-formulation for direct nasal-spraying. In this reported clinical trial, the data showed that LiveSpo Navax was safe for all of the participants, providing 1–2-day earlier and 10–60% more effective in resolution of symptoms. Notably, after 5-day treatment, while 12.5–25% patients in Control group still experienced runny nose and dry rales, all patients in Navax group were fully recovered. This data is consistent with our recent study in pediatric RSV infected patients26, further reinforcing our hypothesis that the nasal-spraying Bacillus spores non-specifically interact with nasal mucosal immune system, virus, and bacteria, thereby can support treatment of rapidly emerging RTIs virus in general such as RSV, influenza virus. This may also be applicable for adenovirus, rhinovirus, and coronavirus, etc. When compared to other recent trials of orally digested probiotics, our results showed a much faster response (days vs. months) and stronger efficacy (hundreds folds more effective than standard care) when used as a supportive therapy of ARTIs. In previously reported clinical trials in young children using oral administrative probiotics, a slight improvement in symptomatic relief was observed only after a 3-month regimen of B. coagulans GBI-30 6086 probiotics21. No significant reduction in the incidence of respiratory infection was documented with 3.5-month usage of B. subtilis DE111 probiotics30.The sprayed Bacillus spores can provide an additional barrier of protection to help increase the effectiveness of preventing respiratory viral infection, especially in immunized cases having low in-situ antibody levels in the nasal tract or appearance of new immunity-escape mutations. We showed that LiveSpo Navax therapy were 26-fold more effective than standard-of-care therapy in reducing influenza viral load. These findings are agreeable with the previous in-vitro and animal study reporting that one B. subtilis spores can non-specifically adsorb eight H5N1 influenza virions and that the virus-spore complexes can function as a nasal-drop vaccine with 80% protection of mice against H5N1 viral challenge infection at 5LD50 dosage31. Hong et al.32 have also shown that nasal drops of B. subtilis spores lowered influenza level by 4–5 folds in mice by improving the antiviral function of alveolar macrophages32. Co-infections caused by S. pneumoniae and H. influenza worsen the respiratory failure, lengthen the treatment period, raise the cost of antibiotic treatment and further cause antibiotic-resistance33. Our data showed that at day 2 of nasal-spraying Bacillus spores, the concentration of H. influenzae and/or S. pneumoniae was reduced by 1152 folds compared to day 0, and 65-fold more effective than in the Control group. However, due to the range of variables in measurement as well as the small size of the patient cohort represented with co-infection (n = 10 in Control vs. n = 16 in Navax groups), the observed difference did not reach statistical significance. Nevertheless, the data suggests a trend in reduction of bacterial co-infection in nasal tract when Bacillus spores was used. The data is also consistent with our recent data showing most of RSV patients with bacterial co-infection in Navax group achieved complete clearance of infection at day 3 of treatment while less-effective reduction in bacterial concentration was observed in the majority of patients in the Control group26.Innate immunity plays an important role in influenza. T-helper responses are critical in stimulating cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) proliferation, as well as the production of cytokines31. In infants with acute influenza infection, inflammation in the upper and lower airways is dominated by an intense neutrophilia, with overreacted release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α produced in response to influenza34. According to our findings, Bacillus spore spraying could modulate “cytokine storm” in the nasal cavity of influenza-infected patients by regulating cell-mediated immune responses. At day 0, the levels of cytokines were at their peaks in nasopharyngeal samples, with IL-8 exhibited the highest level, followed by IL-6, and TNF-α. The data is consistent with a recent report by Garcia et al35. After 2 days of treatment, levels of IL-6 and IL-8 in nasopharyngeal samples of patients in the Navax group were reduced by 9.5 and 1.1 folds compared to the Control group. Meanwhile the reduction of TNF-α in both groups was equal (about fourfold reduced). Several in-vitro and animal studies have demonstrated that specific probiotic strains can provide protection against virus infections by regulating cytokine responses in respiratory epithelial cells20,22. Therefore, this study, along with the recently published study involving RSV26 support the notion that while cell mediated immunity does not specially prevent viral infection, it can facilitate recovery of infection related symptoms.Previous studies have shown that probiotics can enhance immune response by activating IgA secretion and boosting the activity of key immune components like Peyer’s plaques, neutrophils, macrophages, natural killer cells, mesenteric lymph nodes, and intraepithelial lymphocytes. These immune-enhancing mechanisms were implied among the main effects of probiotics in defending against and managing respiratory infections36,37. IgA is the predominant immunoglobulin in the respiratory tract. It is known that a large repertoire of IgA produced by B lymphocytes plays an important role in protecting against viral infections, defending the epithelial barriers from pathogens, and regulating excessive immune responses in inflammatory diseases38. Here, we observed a significant 1.3-fold increase in IgA levels in the Navax group after 2 days of treatment, while there were also significant changes in the concentrations of influenza virus, bacterial co-infection, and cytokines. The correlative relationship suggests that the antigenic outermost proteins of Bacillus spores may induce secretion of mucosal IgA in the nasal tract. This, in turn, may assist in defending against influenza viruses and bacterial co-infection and regulating overactivation of the immune system. However, we noted that the observed 1.2-fold increase in IgA levels of the Navax group compared to the Control group at day 2 was not statistically significant. On the other hand, it is possible that Navax treatment may also enhance immunity against the virus and/or co-infecting bacterial pathogens. Additional sampling of patients at the later time points might provide better assessments of immune responses. However, due to ethical concerns in research involving young children, collection of nasopharyngeal samples was limited to only once for each time point day 0 and 2. Future studies to increase the sample size will help further substantiate the initial observation. It is also noted that the limited materials obtained from nasopharyngeal samples was only sufficient for measuring the viral loads, bacterial co-infection, Bacillus spores by real-time RT/PCR, and concentrations of the three cytokines and IgA by conventional ELISA method. Therefore, other pro-inflammatory cytokines with potential prognostic value in influenza infection relating to Th1/Th2 balance were not included in the evaluation. The procedure thus limited the evaluation of other immuno-stimulatory parameters that regulate immune cell proliferation and differentiation following influenza infection for better understanding mechanisms of action for nasal-spraying Bacillus spores against influenza infection. It also restricted the assessment of changes in viral and bacterial loads, as well as immune indices, over time. As a result, the constraints hinder our interpretability of the supporting data for subclinical parameters influenced by the nasal-spraying of Bacillus spores. Taken all together, we propose that sprayed Bacillus spores alleviate influenza virus infection in nasal tracts via multiple pathways (the proposed model presented in Fig. 6).Figure 6Schematic presentation of possible mechanisms of actions for nasal-spraying Bacillus spores against viral infection (created by Adobe Illustrator 2020, URL: https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html, and adapted from Lehtoranta20). (1) Bacillus spores adsorb virions via non-specific interaction with their outer coat proteins, thereby eliminating or inactivating and the virus; (2) Abundant Bacillus spores adhering to the epithelial surface may block attachment of viral and co-infecting pathogens, covering receptor sites in a non-specific manner; (3) Bacillus spores may germinate and produce antimicrobial compounds that have direct antibacterial activity against bacterial co-infection; (4) Bacillus spores activate macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs): (i) CD8 + T lymphocytes differentiate into cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), (ii) Th1 differentiate from CD4 + T lymphocytes, then activate phagocytes and natural killer cells, thereby destroying virus-infected cells, (iii) Th2 differentiate from CD4 + T lymphocytes and then stimulate the proliferation of B lymphocytes that differentiate into plasma cells, which may travel back infection site to secrete IgA to neutralize the virus; (5) Bacillus spores compete with viruses for interaction with epithelium, thereby modulate hyper-induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α.Full size imageBecause the mechanism of interaction between Bacillus spores with nasal mucosal immune system, virus, and bacteria is non-specific, our findings in both this study and the published RSV study26 provide strong evidence that nasal-spraying Bacillus spores could be useful for supportive treatment of rapidly emerging RTIs viruses, including influenza virus, RSV, and adenovirus, rhinovirus, and coronavirus, among others. Nasal-spraying Bacillus spores can provide an additional barrier of protection which increases the overall effectiveness of vaccines and drugs in preventing and treating viral infection as well as reduces the cost and treatment time of antibiotics for bacterial co-infection. The probiotic treatment is easy to administer, low cost with the use of bioreactors, and effective against respiratory viral infection. These factors make it an ideal solution for developing countries that have limited medical resources and face challenges with hospital overload. In a near future, a clinical trial should be conducted to evaluate the preventive effects of nasal-spraying Bacillus spores on respiratory tract infections in children during the transitional season, especially when there is a high prevalence of viral and bacterial pathogens.ConclusionThis is the first clinical-trial to demonstrate the safety and effects of nasal-spraying Bacillus liquid-form probiotics in the symptomatic treatment of acute ARTIs in children infected with influenza virus. This novel supportive approach has shortened the treatment period by 2 days and improved symptomatic treatment efficacy by 58%. The sprayed Bacillus spores significantly inhibited the multiplications of influenza virus (417 folds), reduced bacterial co-infection concentrations (1152 folds), decreased the overreacted immune response of epithelium cells to lower IL-6 (53.9-fold), IL-8 (1.1-fold), and TNF-α (3.7-fold) pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, and increased IgA (by 1.3-fold) in nasal tract right at day 2 of treatment period. This was 26-fold (for viral loads), 65-fold (for bacterial concentrations), 1.1–9.5-fold (for cytokine levels), and 1.3-fold (for IgA levels) more effective than the control standard-of-care group.Materials and methodsMaterialsNasal-spraying probiotics LiveSpo Navax (LiveSpo Pharma, Hanoi, Vietnam) was formulated as a 0.9% NaCl physiological saline suspension containing Bacillus subtilis ANA4 (accession no. MT123906.1 in NCBI) and B. clausii ANA39 (accession no. MT275656.1 in NCBI) spores at ≥ 5 × 109 CFU/ 5 mL26. The product was manufactured as a Class-A medical device product (No: 210001337/PCBA-HN) under ISO 13,485:2016 standard. Taste and smell were indistinguishable between LiveSpo Navax and 0.9% NaCl physiological saline (B.Braun, Germany). Because of the opaque plastic container, the color and turbidity of LiveSpo Navax suspension is unrecognizable.Ethical issues, study design, and patient collectionThis study received ethics approval by the Ethics Committee in Medical Research of the Vietnam National Children’s Hospital under Decision No. 441/BVNTW-VNCSKTE, and was conducted with the ethical principles in accordance with the Helsinki statement and the ICH GCP guidelines, the Health Department's current ethical regulations and standards of research using subject’s human. All parents of pediatric patients who volunteered to participate in the study were given information about the study and signed an informed consent form. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov of US. National Library of Medicine with Identifier No: NCT05378022 on 17/05/2022.This was a double-blind, randomized, controlled intervention pilot study. Patients were randomly assigned to either the control group (named “Control” group) received 0.9% NaCl or the experimental group (named “Navax” group) received the probiotics LiveSpo Navax. The study was implemented at the International Center, Vietnam National Children’s Hospital from December 2020 to April 2022. The size of the patient cohorts (n = 43 per group) was calculated based on a hypothesis that LiveSpo Navax treatment effectively alleviates influenza-infection symptoms by 25% more than standard of care with α = 0.05 and the power level of 0.826. A total of 218 participants were screened for eligibility and 100 eligible participants (n = 50 per group) were randomly assigned by lottery to Control and Navax group to reduce the risk of about 20% patient’s drop out during follow-up treatment. After parents of children signed the informed consent form, the chief nurse randomly selected paper sheets with the coding numbers 1 or 2 from a carton box and immediately assigned the coding number to each participant. The Control and Navax groups were assigned the numbers 1 and 2, respectively, and this information was also confidential to parents of children, nurses, and investigators, with the exception of the principal investigator and the data analyst26. The flowchart of the study design is shown in Fig. 1.The inclusion criteria for this study included children of both genders, aged between 4 months and 7 years, who were admitted to the hospital due to upper respiratory infections and tested positive for both flu A and flu B through rapid testing and had consents from parents. Exclusion criteria included newborn babies, having a history of drug allergies, the need for oxygen therapy, being discharged before day 2, being lost to follow-up, being withdrawn from the trial, continuing in the trial but missing data, receiving flu vaccination within one year, and meeting the criteria for psychiatric disorders other than depression and/or anxiety.Questionnaires, treatment procedures, and clinical observationThe patient's parents were required to provide information of their children. Nurses were given coded sprayers in the form of blind samples and were educated to use the sprayers with dosages of about 50 µl 0.9% NaCl physiological saline (with/without 2.5 × 108 Bacillus spores) per each nasal cavity/ time × 3 times/ day directly into the nasal cavity continuously for maximal follow-up 5 days of treatment. As shown in Table 2, the nasal spray products were applied in parallel with routine treatment drugs at hospital. Antibiotics were assigned for all patients who tested positive for co-infection pathogens. For primary outcomes, patients were monitored daily during treatment for typical clinical symptoms of influenza infections, including runny nose, dry rales, moist rales, body temperature (oC), pulse oxymetry (SpO2) (%), pulse (beats/min), and breath (beats/min) until discharged.Routine diagnostics at hospitalScreening of influenza-infected cases from nasopharyngeal samples at day 0 was firstly conducted by using “BD Veritor System for Detection of Flu A + B” kit (Bection Dickison, NJ, US). Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations and white blood cell counts were measured to access the level of infection. Cardiopulmonary X-ray was appointed for visualization of lung hyperinflation, osler’s nodes, atelectasis… Due to ethical concerns, all these tests were conducted only at day 0 (Table 2).Real-time PCR for detection of microorganism in nasopharyngeal samplesDNA/RNA from 200 µl nasopharyngeal specimens (repeated twice) was extracted by MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Roche Diagnostics, IA, US), and 100 µl of the purified DNA/RNA was aliquoted into three PCR tubes (approximately 30 µlube) for storage at – 80 °C.As secondary outcomes, semi-quantitative assays for measuring changes in viral load of influenza virus (types A and B) and bacterial co-infection concentrations (Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae) in nasal tract between days 0 and 2 was conducted by the real-time RT-PCR/PCR, following a similar methodology as described previously26,39,40,41,. The primers and probes used for specific amplification of influenza virus types A, B, and Ribonuclease P as internal control39,40,41 by real-time RT-PCR TaqMan probe was presented in Table S1. Reactions were set up to include an initial reverse transcription at 50 °C for 30 min, 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 45 amplification and detection cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 30 s. To simultaneously detect multiple bacterial co-infections, the Allplex Respiratory Panel 4 kit (Seegene, Seoul, Korea) was utilized. This commercial kit allows for the detection of seven pathogenic bacterial species, including Bordetella parapertussis (BPP), Bordetella pertussis (BP), Chlamydophila pneumoniae (CP), Haemophilus influenzae (HI), Legionella pneumophila (LP), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP), Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP). Reactions following company’s protocol used an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 45 amplification and detection cycles at 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 10 s. The read-out standardization for the analysis of influenza virus and bacterial co-infection needed to be adjusted to a Ct of < 40 to confirm whether they are a true positive or not. The protocols for influenza virus and the bacterial co-infection detection had been standardized according to ISO 15,189:2012 criteria and routinely employed for testing of clinical samples in Department of Molecular Biology for Infectious Diseases, Vietnam National Children’s Hospital.Detection of B. subtilis ANA4 and B. clausii ANA39 in nasopharyngeal samples was also conducted at day 0 and day 2 by real-time PCR SYBR Green using primers specific for detection of B. subtilis42 and B. clausii43 (Table S1) at the following condition: 95 °C for 10 min, amplification for 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 20 s, 72 °C for 30 s. The read-out standardization for B. subtilis and B. clausii analysis was set at Ct < 35 to confirm true positive. The protocol for B. subtilis and B. clausii detection had been developed following the ISO 17,025:2017 guideline and applied for research purpose only at Department of Molecular Biology for Infectious Diseases, Vietnam National Children’s Hospital.ELISA assays for cytokine and IgA levelsOther secondary outcomes including (i) pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (pg/mL) of interleukin (IL-6, IL-8) and TNF-α, and (ii) IgA levels (mg/mL) in nasopharyngeal samples at days 0 and 2 were quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (ELISA). IL-6 and TNF-α were quantified from 100 µL samples by the Human IL-6 DuoSet ELISA and the Human TNF-α ELISA kit, respectively (R&D Systems, MN, US). IL-8 was quantified by 50 µL samples by IL-8 Human ELISA kit (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, US). IgA was quantified by 10 µL samples by Human IgA ELISA kit (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, US).Data collection and statistical analysisIndividual medical records were collected, and the patient's information was then gathered in a data set. The reduction levels (2△Ct) of influenza viral load and bacterial co-infection concentrations. △Ct for target genes was calculated as Ct (threshold cycle) at day 2–Ct at day 0 while Ct of internal control was adjusted to be equal among all samples. Tabular analysis was conducted on dichotomous variables using either χ2 test, Fisher’s exact test. The Wilcoxon test or Mann–Whitney test was utilized to compare the medians of quantitative variables within the same group or between two groups. GraphPad Prism v8.4.3 software was used for statistical and graphical analyses (GraphPad Software, CA, USA). All analyses were conducted with a significance level of p < 0.05.

Study: Asymptomatic infection with clade 2.3.4.4b highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) in carnivore pets, Italy, April 2023. Image Credit: KHON SUPAN/Shutterstock.com About the infecting virus This virus first infected hens on the same farm. When Italian authorities quarantined the farm due to suspicion of an avian influenza outbreak, this farm had 22 poultry animals: two chicken hens, eight ducks, two geese, and ten chicks. They noted that 16 of 18 hens on the farm died. However, the pet dogs/cat did not show any clinical symptoms of HPAI infection. Reassortment events within the black-headed gulls-adapted H13 subtype gave rise to the HPAI H5N1 BB genotype in Europe in May 2022. By January 2023, it spread widely in black-headed gulls in northern Italy, causing mass mortality around Lake Garda. This genotype also caused seven outbreaks on commercial farms in the Veneto and Emilia Romagna regions. Given its spread among wild birds in the area surrounding the farm, surveyors anticipated detecting the virus as the farm was around 10 km south of Lake Garda. Sampling for virological and serological investigations At the time of the first sampling, i.e., 17 April 2023, surveyors collected nasal swab samples from 10 people, including the owner and his five family members, three veterinarians, and one worker who did bird culling and corpse disposal. The second sampling took place six to nine months later. They sampled the dog twice, though only collected blood samples, and the cat once. Further, the researchers used a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the M gene of AIV to test tracheal and cloacal swab samples of humans and birds. They analyzed samples testing positive in this test using two other RT-PCRs directed towards the H5 and H7 genomes and neuraminidase subtype and H5 pathotype. Only hen samples tested positive for AIV, whereas human, duck, and goose samples tested negative. Further, the team performed whole genome sequencing of one positive sample derived from hens. Next, they aligned these genomic sequences to closely related sequences from the global initiative on sharing all influenza data (GISAID) database identified via BLAST search, which revealed that the infecting virus belonged to genotype BB, clade 2.3.4.4b. Molecular analysis uncovered an atypical mutation, T271A, in viral protein PB2, which suggested this virus adapted to infect mammals. Notably, this mutation has never been detected in clade 2.3.4.4b H5Nx viruses affecting birds in Europe since 2020 but was responsible for an outbreak in minks (a mammalian species) in Spain. This observation raises the possibility that this virus might have spread from mammals to birds. The team used a suite of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to test dog and cat sera, with all assays directed towards monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against nucleoprotein type A (NPA), neuraminidases N1, N2, N3 and N7, as well as hemagglutinins H5, H7. The team confirmed the presence and specificity of H5 mAbs using the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test and by microneutralization (MN) assay based on HPAI-H5N1 and LPAI-H5N3 viruses. These serological tests detected mAbs against NPA, H5, and N1 in dogs and the cat sera at both sampling timepoints. Further analysis revealed sera from all animals except one dog tested positive in HI assay for the H5N1 Gull/23 virus. In the MN assay, sera from all animals were positive for the same strain, albeit with higher titers. The pet animals recording the highest HI and MN titers against the Gull/23 virus also scored higher neutralizing titers in the MN assay directed towards the Mal/08 virus. Finally, the team tested human sera using the same H5-EL competitive ELISA used for pets but a modified MN assay to test the pet sera. The test results confirmed all 10 humans were asymptomatic. Conclusion The current study presented serological evidence of HPAI H5N1 virus infection in five dogs and one cat on a poultry farm in Italy, highlighting the significance of genetic surveillance for early detection of avian viruses adapting rapidly to infect mammals with increased zoonotic potential. More importantly, whole genomic sequencing of these viruses is needed to identify gene mutations correlated with these adaptations. Journal reference: Moreno A, Bonfante F, Bortolami A, et al.

This column seeks to broaden the debate by shifting the focus from the impact of health crises on incumbent governments to their effects on the broader political landscape. In the context of Weimar Germany, constituencies that experienced a more severe outbreak of the Spanish flu witnessed a notable shift in voting towards left-wing parties. These voters gravitated towards parties that had previously demonstrated expertise in public health matters, as opposed to merely penalising local incumbents. Authors Stefan Bauernschuster Matthias Blum Erik Hornung Christoph Koenig Share Twitter Facebook LinkedIn The Covid-19 pandemic has cast a spotlight on public health topics across the world. As we grapple with the persisting potential of intense epidemics, it is crucial to gain a comprehensive understanding of their impact on the political economy. Much scholarly attention has been devoted to studying the consequences of the implemented lockdown policies – or their absence – for incumbent governments. Depending on the effectiveness of these policy responses, citizens either expressed dissatisfaction with their government or rallied together, united by a common threat, supporting their government. In the early stages of the pandemic, Herrera et al. (2020) suggested that the approval rates of governments worldwide declined when they failed to control the virus. In Europe, citizens responded favourably to their incumbent government if it relied on scientific expertise (Daniele et al. 2020). Using outcomes from presidential election, Baccini et al. (2021) show that the incumbent lost more votes in US counties more severely affected by Covid-19. Similarly, during French municipal elections, regions subjected to stringent lockdown measures witnessed an upswing in support for the incumbent (Giommoni and Loumeau 2020). Looking for answers in the long history of epidemics across the world, Arroyo Abad and Maurer (2021) study the 1918 Influenza pandemic in the US, and estimate that poor health outcomes had negative, albeit modest, effects on incumbent parties. In light of our recent study (Bauernschuster et al. 2023), this column argues that exploring pandemics’ effects on political competition at large beyond the impact on incumbent parties offers valuable new insights. In our paper, we analyse how the 1918 Influenza pandemic influenced voting in the Weimar Republic. Historical background In 1918, WWI had not yet ended when a mysterious pandemic spread and eventually killed an estimated 39 million people across the globe (Barro et al. 2020). Initially starting at Fort Riley, Kansas, the virus soon reached Europe through troop movements. The US closed theatres and museums, and some cities responded with lockdowns, thereby effectively flattening the mortality curve (Correia et al. 2022). The situation was different in the German Empire, where the second, deadly wave of the virus coincided with the Hundred Days Offensive, the final phase of the war on the Western Front. Politicians took no action out of concern for the morale of the people. Censorship prevailed, and the press did not report the outbreak at first; coverage was minimal in the second wave in October and November 1918. The war and the peace negotiations dominated the news at the time. Yet, the pandemic was quite salient for the population. According to estimates, the Spanish flu killed more than 400,000 people in Germany within just a few months – slightly more than German military casualties during the same year (Barro et al. 2020). The pandemic had an impact on everyday life, not only because of the numerous deaths, but also because many people were unable to work due to illness, causing delays in production processes and public life. Empirical approach To study the impact of the influenza on the political landscape, we have to measure its intensity at the local level. In absence of a direct measure of Spanish flu deaths, we used administrative constituency-level mortality data from 1904 to 1918, predict excess mortality in 1918, and econometrically purge this measure from military casualties (see Figure 1). Plausibility checks at the city level, where data on causes of death are available, show that the resulting variable indeed picks up Spanish Flu mortality. Figure 1 Estimated Spanish flu mortality across constituencies Notes: The map depicts Spanish flu mortality in 1918 across constituencies. Spanish flu mortality in 1918 is excess mortality in 1918 purged of military deaths in 1918 per 1,000 individuals in 1910. Yellow dots indicate the location of the cities included in the city-level analysis. Using excess mortality due to the Spanish flu as a measure of the local intensity of the pandemic, we compare the voting behaviour between strongly and weakly affected constituencies in a dynamic difference-in-differences model over the period 1893 to 1939. This model allows us to factor out constant regional differences in voting behaviour as well as general election specific effects that applied to all regions. Additionally, we control for changes in the electorate across constituencies; this is crucial since from the last Reichstag election before the outbreak of the Spanish flu in the German Empire in 1912 to the first election thereafter in 1919 in the Weimar Republic, the voting age was lowered and women’s suffrage was introduced. Moreover, to make the voting data comparable over time, we work with constituency boundaries from the Empire and group parties into three larger groups, the left-leaning bloc, the centrist bloc, and the right-leaning bloc. Main results We find that constituencies with higher and lower influenza mortality follow a similar voting trend in the entire pre-pandemic period from 1893 to 1912, the last election before the Spanish flu. Only after the Spanish flu, we observe a significant increase in vote shares for the left-leaning bloc in constituencies with higher influenza mortality. If the number of influenza deaths increases by two per 1,000 population, which corresponds to an increase of about 30% of the average influenza mortality, the left-wing vote share increases by 8.1% compared to 1912. This effect remains stable until 1933 (see Figure 2). Figure 2 Event study for left-wing vote share Notes: The figure plots coefficients estimated from an event-study specification with 95% confidence intervals. The dependent variable measures left-wing vote shares at the constituency level for 14 elections between 1893 and 1933. The main explanatory variable is predicted Spanish flu mortality in 1918 as shown in Figure 1, interacted with election-fixed effects. Demographic controls and war-related, controls interacted with time-fixed effects included. The omitted reference election is 1912. Standard errors are clustered at the constituency level. The grey-shaded area marks the pandemic. We provide a rich set of validity and robustness checks to rule out confounding factors. One concern might be that the shift to the left is driven by increased poverty or inequality during WWI. We use data on wealth and income distribution to calculate Gini coefficients, a statistical measure of inequality, and use data on the share of the poor. However, the inclusion of these control variables in our model does not change the findings. We also examine trends in infant mortality, as this is often considered an important indicator of precarious living conditions, such as food shortages. However, we do not find that infant mortality trends are different in constituencies with higher or lower influenza mortality before 1918. Moreover, data on city-level causes of death show that our effects are indeed driven by mortality due to respiratory diseases, the very death category in which influenza deaths are included. Furthermore, we do not find even remotely similar effects for excess mortality from the war years before 1918, nor for excess mortality in 1918 that is not explained by the Spanish flu. Thus, we conclude that the political shift to the left was indeed caused specifically by the Spanish flu. Mechanisms Political science often attempts to explain voting behaviour by arguing that voters either reward incumbents for good policies or punish them for poor ones. However, this paradigm does not seem to hold true in our context. Our data show that winners of pre-Influenza elections do not exhibit any systematic increase or decrease in the likelihood to garner votes in response to the Spanish flu. Another conceivable scenario involves protest votes favouring extremist parties. Yet, our analysis can dismiss this notion as well, since we find no evidence of increased polarisation in more affected constituencies. Rather, an extended analysis, in which we break down the left bloc, shows that the moderate left, represented by the SPD, gains most of the votes. The Communist Party, instead, witnesses a decline in votes. Finally, we do not find evidence that our effect on left-wing votes can be explained by economic hardship and inequality due to the Spanish flu (Galletta and Giommoni and Galletta) driving people to vote for the left. The most plausible explanation for our findings aligns with the ‘issue ownership’ theory from political science (see, for instance, Budge and Farlie 1983 and Petrocik 1996). According to this theory, parties that lay claim to a specific issue and effectively signal their expertise in it tend to receive more votes when the issue becomes salient among voters. The pandemic made health irreversibly a public issue instead of a private affair and parties that historically engaged with this topic were able to capitalise on their expertise. The SPD's success after 1918 probably lies in its establishment and ownership of health as a prominent public concern—a stance that predates the Spanish flu outbreak. With its focus on the conditions of the working class, Social Democrats had health on their agenda early on and were strongly involved in the self-governing bodies of the health insurance funds. It is a historical irony that the SPD, having initially vehemently criticized Bismarck's introduction of compulsory health insurance in 1884 as an attempt to sway the working class, gained credit for this ground-breaking social policy in later years. Our research provides another finding in support of the ‘issue ownership’ theory: analyses indicate that the liberals, a party that counted numerous physicians among its members and supported the social hygiene movement, also managed to capitalise on the pandemic's political implications.

Flu in the Northern Hemisphere is often caused by viruses similar to those that spread in the Southern Hemisphere during their winter flu season. This year's Southern Hemisphere flu season This year's Southern Hemisphere flu season had an earlier peak during April to May, compared to typical peaks in June to July. Of the specimens that tested positive for Influenza, approximately 90% of the viruses were Influenza Type A and 10% were Influenza Type B. What happens in the Southern Hemisphere does not necessarily predict what will happen in the Northern Hemisphere. This is because different flu viruses may spread more commonly in different parts of the world and immunity may vary between populations. View LargerDownload Of the specimens that tested positive for Influenza, approximately 90% of the viruses were Influenza Type A. The U.S. 2023-2024 flu vaccines have a similar vaccine virus composition as the 2023 Southern Hemisphere flu vaccines. A new CDC study, which looked at children and adults in five South American countries during the 2023 winter flu season (our summertime), shows flu vaccine performed well against those viruses. This study found that people who had received a flu vaccine were half as likely to be hospitalized with flu compared to people who had not been vaccinated. This finding shows that flu vaccine provides protection against serious outcomes. This season's U.S. flu vaccines could provide similar benefit against serious flu outcomes during the upcoming season if the same viruses continue to spread here. Last flu season started early in the U.S., with activity increasing nationally at the beginning of October 2022 and peaking in early-December 2022, causing an estimated 27 million illnesses and 300,000 hospitalizations. To prepare for this flu season, Americans should begin getting vaccinated against flu, and ideally, be vaccinated before the end of October. Check vaccines.gov to find a flu vaccine near you.

Recent data show that CoN staphylococci are capable of secreting a number of enterotoxins and cytotoxins, normally produced by S. aureus. Herewith, we describe a case of TSS caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis with a favorable outcome.Case presentationWe report a case of a 46-year-old man who developed TSS from S. epidermidis. The patient was admitted for a 7-day history of general malaise and headache following a recent influenza infection and a 3-day history of vomiting, diarrhea, diffuse erythroderma, and fever. The main laboratory findings on admission were leukopenia (WBC 800/mm3), thrombocytopenia (Plt count 78.000/mm3), elevated urea, creatine levels and increased inflammatory markers (CRP 368 mg/ml). The patient had clinical and radiological evidence of pneumonia with chest computed tomography (CT) showing diffuse bilateral airspace opacifications with air bronchogram. On the second day, a methicillin resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) strain was detected in both sets of blood cultures, but the organism was unavailable for toxin testing. All other cultures and diagnostic PCR tests were negative. His clinical signs and symptoms fulfilled at that stage four out of five clinical criteria of TSS with a fever of 39 °C, diffuse erythroderma, multisystem involvement and hypotension. On the same day the patient was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure. The initial treatment was meropenem, vancomycin, levofloxacin, clindamycin, IVIG and steroids. Finger desquamation appeared on the 9th day of hospitalization, fulfilling all five clinical criteria for TSS.ConclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first adult case with TSS induced by CoNS (MRSE) secondary to an influenza type B infection, who had favorable progression and outcome. Further research is warranted to determine how TSS is induced by the CoNS infections. Peer Review reports BackgroundA common cause of severe influenza pathogenesis is superinfection with bacterial pathogens, most frequently, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae [1]. Regardless of the infectious agent, bacterial superinfections are associated with increased morbidity and mortality rates during influenza pandemic and epidemic outbreaks [2]. According to the literature, the resolution of inflammation following an episode of influenza infection, is regarded as a period of enhanced susceptibility to several respiratory bacterial infections, resulting in bacterial superinfection, bacterial pneumonia and bacterial dissemination from the lungs [3]. This co-pathogenesis is characterized by complex interactions between co-infecting pathogens and the host, leading to dysregulation of immune responses and delays in a return to homeostasis [4].Coagulase-negative staphylococci are under-appreciated as a cause of severe clinical conditions, including TSS [5,6,7]. Previous studies have shown that coagulase-negative staphylococci do not produce the toxin TSST-1, but they are capable of secreting a number of staphylococcal enterotoxins and cytotoxins, normally produced by S. aureus [6, 7]. Recently Staphylococcal enterotoxins A, D, and E were detected in Staphylococcal epidermidis strains playing the role of superantigens [11]. An immune reaction to the proliferation of CoNS organisms that causes cytokine activation has been proposed as an additional possible pathophysiological mechanism of CoNS induced TTS [8]. In particular, strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from patients with toxic shock symptoms have been reported to carry genes related to stimulation of human monocytes fostering the production of the cytokines TNF alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-6 [8]. To date, the incidence of TSS induced by CoNS is largely not known and only few cases have been reported in the literature [8,9,10,11].Case presentationWe report a case of a 46-year-old man, without chronic underlying conditions, who developed TSS from S. epidermidis following an influenza type B infection. The patient was brought to the hospital on an ambulance. He was admitted to the hospital for a 7-day history of general malaise, headache following a recent influenza type B infection, who gradually developed vomiting, diarrhea, diffuse erythroderma and fever during the last three days before admission. The consciousness level on admission, body temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and peripheral oxygen saturation were E3V4M6, 39 °C, 87/50 mmHg, 130 beats/minute, 38 breaths/minute, and 91%, respectively. The main laboratory findings on admission were as following: leukopenia (WBC 800/mm3), thrombocytopenia (Plt count 78,000/mm3), elevated urea, creatine levels and increased inflammatory markers (CRP 248 mg/ml) [Table 1]. The patient had clinical and radiological evidence of pneumonia with chest computed tomography (CT) showing diffuse bilateral airspace opacification [Fig. 1]. Head CT was normal.Fig. 1Chest computed tomography on admissionFull size imageOn the second day, both sets of blood cultures obtained from two different peripheral venous sites (left and right arm) were positive for S. epidermidis, but the organism was unavailable for toxin testing. According to the antibiogram, the strain was resistant to methicillin (Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, MRSE). Urine cultures were negative. After intubation for sedation and procedures, both sputum and endotracheal cultures showed growth of only normal upper respiratory flora. The results of the full respiratory pathogen PCR panel, including SARS-CoV-2, were negative. The patient’s condition deteriorated on the same day, presenting acute respiratory failure, and he was admitted to the ICU. His clinical signs and symptoms fulfilled at that stage four out of five clinical criteria of TSS with a fever of 39 °C, diffuse erythroderma, multisystem involvement and hypotension [Table 2] [12]. Based on the clinical diagnosis of probable CoNS induced TTS and the critical condition of the patient, the following treatment was initiated during the first days of hospitalization: meropenem (1 g every 8 h), vancomycin (1 g every 12 h), levofloxacin (750 mg 24 h), clindamycin (600 mg every 8 h). The choice of the initial empirical antibiotic therapy was based on local guidelines due to high antimicrobial resistant rates (AMR) rates. The addition of clindamycin was based on the high suspicion of TTS. IVIG (2 g/kg) and hydrocortisone (100 mg every 8 h) were administrated to the patient due to high suspicion of TTS The mechanism responsible for the efficacy of gamma-globulin (IVIG) therapy may be neutralization of the circulating toxins, inhabitation of TNF-alpha production via nonspecific inhabitation of monocyte or T-cell activation, or inhibition of other staphylococcal virulence factors. The patient became afebrile within the first 72 h of ICU admission. During the first 5 days of ICU stay, his PLT and WBC count reached its nadir. Finger desquamation mainly on his feet appeared on the 9th day of hospitalization, fulfilling at that stage five out of five clinical criteria for TSS [Fig. 2]. During the ICU stay, the patient presented acute renal failure and he received renal replacement therapy with hemofiltration for 21 days. The platelet count remained low and due to the increased risk of central nervous system (CNS) bleeding, the patient received additionally after PLTs transfusions, PLT growth factor, eltrombopag (75 mg 24 h), and dexamethasone (8 mg every 8 h) for 4 consecutive days, after having a hematologist expert consultation with the indication of persistent refractory thrombocytopenia. All drug doses were accordingly adjusted. The patient gradually improved over the following 2 months, and he was discharged from the hospital without sequelae.Table 1 Laboratory data at admissionFull size tableFig. 2Foot desquamation on 9th day of hospitalizationFull size imageDiscussion and conclusionThe current patient was diagnosed with TSS, as he fulfilled all five diagnostic criteria proposed by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (USA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US) [12]. To the best of our knowledge this is the first adult case with a TSS syndrome induced by Staphylococcus epidermitis following an influenza type B infection, who had favorable progression and outcome.According to the literature, both clinically and experimentally, bacterial complications (super-infections) are most pronounced after 5–7 days of acute influenza infection, which was evident also in our case [13]. Deciphering the mechanisms of bacterial superinfections (loss of the epithelial barrier function and altered innate immune defense), is of importance, to provide new diagnostic tools and therapeutic approaches. According to the literature influenza infection appears to prime the host airways for bacterial infection, whilst modifying and impairing immune responses in a number of ways. Viral induced immunosuppression can allow for a bacterial super infection, as host immune responses can be suppressed when immunologic cells are impaired during influenza infection and immune cell dysfunction can reduce the host’s ability to fight bacteria [14].Typically, TSS is caused by S. aureus or streptococcal infections. Exotoxins secreted from Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes might act as superantigens enhancing inflammation processes via cytokine storm release [5, 6]. However, the exact pathophysiological mechanism behind the presence of TSS induced by CoNS, remains largely unknown and warrants further investigation.The true incidence of TSS by CoNS is an unexplored territory, and currently only few cases have been reported in the literature [Table 3]. Among them, a recently published case by Goda K et al. with TSS caused by a CoNS species (Staphylococcus simulans) after an episode of pneumococcal pneumonia associated with influenza [10]. Of interest, this case presented with high levels of inflammatory markers and cytokines (neopterin and IL-6), supporting the hypothesis of a cytokine storm release in CoNS TSS [10]. Similarly, Pomputius WF et al. reported a pediatric case of CoNS TSS due to S. epidermitis [11]. Although superantigen proteins were not isolated from the bloodstream of the child, a panel of four superantigen genes were finally detected in the plasma, suggesting that the CoNS found in urine, could be a causative agent inducing TSS.Table 2 TTS criteria [12]Full size tableTable 3 Case series of published CoNS induced TSS in the recent literatureFull size tableTo conclude, we present a rare adult case TSS caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). It remains to be further evaluated how TSS is induced by the CoNS infection, with several mechanisms being proposed, including the presence of superantigens and hyper inflammation induced by cytokine mediators.

As of last week, an outbreak of a deadly strain of the avian influenza had likely killed 1,700 gulls and Caspian terns on Rat Island – a small wildlife preserve near the state park, and its adjacent shores. The island is currently closed due to the outbreak. The Department of Health said Friday that preliminary results show three harbor seals in the area have likely been infected with the disease, though confirmation testing is still pending. The Rat Island outbreak of the new strain, known as H5N1, is believed to have begun this year and left the Department of Fish and Wildlife scrambling to test suspected cases and clean up hundreds of bird carcasses as they tried to stop the spread of the disease to other wild animals, including seals. Infected Caspian terns have also been found near the Port of Everett, the Port of Tacoma and along the lower Columbia River, according to the Department of Health. Historically, bird flu has affected mostly poultry, but this new strain has proved deadly for wild birds and other animals across the world. Globally, the strain has killed more than 75,000 wild birds. Thousands of sea lions in Peru died from H5N1 last year. Seal deaths in Maine were also linked to the bird flu. At a Washington State Fish and Wildlife Commission meeting last month, officials said they were still trying to gauge the effects of the new flu strain. The first case of the H5N1 strain appeared in Washington in March 2022, but the long-term impacts are still “unknown,” Katie Haman, a wildlife veterinarian at the Department of Fish and Wildlife said during the meeting. “I think time will tell.” The Department of Health is encouraging people and their pets to avoid all contact with sick or dead wildlife. Dogs and other animals can be infected with the flu, and though human infection is rare, it’s not impossible. It can happen when the virus gets into a person’s eyes, nose or mouth, or if it is inhaled through contact with infected saliva or feces. The Department of Fish and Wildlife is encouraging everyone to report sick or dead birds immediately using an online form. Biologists may respond to remove carcasses and test for the virus, though with limited resources, they may not be able to respond to every reported case.

What to know for the 2023-2024 flu season News By Nicoletta Lanese last updated 8 September 2023 When should you get a flu shot, and which shot should people with egg allergies get? Here's CDC guidance for the 2023-2024 flu season. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Flu shots for this season are now available. What are the options? (Image credit: Witthaya Prasongsin/Getty Images) Flu shots for the United States' 2023-2024 influenza season are now available. But when's the best time to get the vaccine, and who should get one?Here's a rundown of what you need to know about this season's flu vaccines.Related: Could we ever eradicate the flu?Who should get a flu shot?Everyone ages 6 months and older should get a flu shot every season, with rare exceptions, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends. These exceptions apply to people with severe, life-threatening allergies to specific vaccine ingredients. These potentially allergy-triggering ingredients include gelatin, which is used as a stabilizer in some vaccines, and certain antibiotics, which prevent bacterial contamination during vaccine manufacturing but can linger in very small quantities in some shots post-production, according to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. People who have had a severe allergic reaction to a flu vaccine should not get the same type of vaccine again and should consult a doctor about whether to get a different shot, the CDC says. People with a history of Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a rare paralyzing condition in which the immune system attacks the nerves, should also consult a doctor before getting a flu shot. But everyone else can assume they should get a shot. Flu shots are especially important for people who are older than 65, younger than 2, pregnant, or have very recently given birth, the CDC states. Note that some children ages 6 months to 8 years are recommended to get two doses of vaccine.When do you get a flu shot?Most people should get a flu shot in September or October, before the flu starts circulating widely, the CDC advises. In a typical season, flu cases start to ramp up in late October and peak between December and February. Although it's ideal to get your flu shot early in the season, it's better to get one late than not at all. Related: The flu shot isn't that effective. Here's why you should still get it.The nasal spray is one of nine different flu vaccines available. (Image credit: Getty Images)What types of flu shots are available?There are nine different flu vaccines available this season, including eight that are injected and one that's sprayed up the nose. All the vaccines guard against four influenza virus subtypes: A(H1N1), A(H3N2), a Yamagata lineage influenza B virus and a Victoria lineage influenza B virus. Speak to a doctor, pharmacist or other health care professional if you have questions about which flu shot is best for you. Standard-dose, inactivated flu shots: Inactivated flu shots contain influenza viruses that have been "killed" so they can no longer infect cells. They are approved for use in people ages 6 months and older. Recombinant flu shots: Recombinant flu shots are made using "recombinant technology," which involves using flu virus genetic material to make a protein found on the virus' surface — hemagglutinin (HA). There is one recombinant vaccine available called Flublok Quadrivalent, and it's approved for use in people ages 18 and older. It's one of three vaccine options especially recommended to people 65 years and older. Nasal spray: The one vaccine that's available as a nasal spray is called FluMist Quadrivalent. It's a live attenuated vaccine, meaning it contains weakened flu viruses that can't cause disease but have not been "killed," like the viruses in inactivated shots. This vaccine is approved for most people ages 2 to 49, but it's not approved for people who are pregnant, have weakened immune systems or have certain other conditions. High-dose and adjuvanted flu shots: One high-dose flu vaccine and one adjuvanted vaccine, which contains an added ingredient to rev up the immune system, are approved for use in people 65 and older. Along with the recombinant shot, these vaccines are especially recommended for older people because they're more protective in this age group than the standard-dose vaccines. The high-dose shot is called Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent and the adjuvanted vaccine is called Fluad Quadrivalent.Which flu shot should people with egg allergies get?People with egg allergies can receive any flu shot, egg-based or otherwise, and they don't need a special doctor's appointment to do so, the CDC says. This advice is based on new guidance from a CDC vaccine advisory committee that recently reviewed the available safety data.Use the CDC's VaccineFinder to search for flu shot administration sites in your area. (Image credit: Peter Dazeley/Getty Images)RELATED STORIES—The worst epidemics and pandemics in history—2 types of flu viruses may have gone extinct—Why is the flu shot less effective than other vaccines?"Egg allergy alone necessitates no additional safety measures for influenza vaccination beyond those recommended for any recipient of any vaccine, regardless of severity of previous reaction to egg," the committee advised. All vaccines should be given in settings where allergic reactions can be recognized and treated quickly, according to the new guidance.When will we know if the flu shots are a "good match"?We typically don't know if the flu shots are a "good match" to circulating strains until later in the season. In 2022, for example, officials announced in December that the flu shots were likely a "very good match." A good match would mean that the flu strains included in the vaccines, which are selected ahead of time, will end up being genetically similar to the strains that actually make people sick during the 2023-2024 season. Vaccine makers decide which flu strains to include in shots for the upcoming season by checking which strains are circulating elsewhere in the world. The Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere flu seasons happen at different times, so flu virus samples collected in one hemisphere can provide the other clues as to what's to come. On Sept. 8, the CDC released data on how well the Southern Hemisphere's flu shots performed during their recent season. Data from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay showed the shots reduced the risk of flu-related hospitalizations by 52%, overall, and were slightly more protective against the predominant A(H1N1) viruses, specifically. Flu shots available in the U.S. might offer similar protection if these viruses dominate in the Northern Hemisphere's flu season, as well.Where can you get a flu vaccine?Use the CDC's VaccineFinder to search for flu shot administration sites in your area.

Opens in a new tab or window email article Mid-season data from the Southern Hemisphere suggest the current season's trivalent and quadrivalent inactivated flu vaccines protect against the most serious outcomes, according to a CDC report. The findings from five South American nations showed an overall vaccine of 51.9% (95% CI 39.2-62.0) against flu-related hospitalization, and that protection reached 55.2% (95% CI 41.8-65.5) when looking at the predominant circulating strain, A(H1N1)pdm09, reported researchers led by Ashley Fowlkes, ScD, of CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases in Atlanta. Whether A(H1N1)pdm09 will continue as the dominant strain for the Northern Hemisphere's flu season remains to be seen, the researchers said, but most cases in the U.S. so far have involved either that strain or B/Victoria viruses. "These early, interim estimates, provided before the expected end of seasonal influenza virus circulation, suggest that vaccination substantially reduced the risk for severe influenza illnesses, underscoring the benefits of influenza vaccination," the group wrote in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. But they found that less than a fourth of the hospitalized individuals who met criteria for study inclusion had been vaccinated before illness onset, noting that reduced vaccination coverage has been seen globally since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. "Health authorities worldwide should encourage influenza vaccination for persons at increased risk for severe disease, including young children, persons with preexisting health conditions, and older adults, as well as those at increased risk for exposure to or transmission of influenza virus, such as health care personnel," the researchers wrote. The current study focused on those particular high-risk groups, but the CDC also lists pregnancy as a high-risk situation; regardless, the agency recommends that all people in the U.S. ages 6 months and older receive a flu shot, preferably in September or October. A higher percentage of positive flu specimens in the new dataset were detected in earlier surveillance weeks compared with the average from 2011 to 2019, though the intensity and timing across the two hemispheres don't always mirror each other, said Fowlkes and co-authors. To evaluate the effectiveness of the current season's vaccines, the researchers employed a test-negative case-control design and looked at 2,780 hospitalizations associated with severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs) in REVELAC-i (Network for the Evaluation of Vaccine Effectiveness in Latin America and the Caribbean–influenza) from March 27 to July 9 of this year. This included cases from Chile (41.7%), Brazil (33%), Uruguay (16.1%), Paraguay (6%), and Argentina (3.2%). Evaluation for vaccine effectiveness started 2 weeks after the launch of each country's vaccination campaign. Researchers looked at three target groups for their analysis: young children (45.4% of cases), older adults (40.6%), and people with preexisting medical conditions (14%). SARI cases involved those with an acute respiratory infection plus a fever and cough that led to hospitalization, with positive flu cases identified by RT-PCR and vaccination status by national immunization records. Influenza was detected in 32.4% of cases, though proportions varied significantly by group: 48.4% of the older adult cases, 35.8% of the group with preexisting health conditions, and 17% of young kids (P<0.001). Most of the 900 positive specimens were influenza type A (90.6%) or type B (9.4%) viruses, and 99.3% of the influenza A viruses subtyped were A(H1N1)pdm09. Overall, 23.9% of the included patients had received a 2023 influenza vaccine, 15.3% of the case patients and 28% of controls. Vaccine effectiveness against flu-related hospitalizations ranged from 37.6% in older adults to 70.2% in children. Effectiveness against flu-related hospitalization from influenza B was not significant (46.2%, 95% CI -7.9 to 73.2). Limitations included that nearly 25% of the patients initially screened for the analysis weren't tested for the flu with RT-PCR. Researchers were also unable to assess whether children had received one or two doses of vaccine. Ian Ingram is Managing Editor at MedPage Today and helps cover oncology for the site.

The research, published today in JAMA Network Open, involved healthcare workers (HCWs) who received Abbott's Influvac Tetra (four-strain) flu vaccine, the bivalent (two-strain) COVID-19 booster from Pfizer/BioNTech, or both (one in each arm), from September 2022 to January 2023. The team collected blood samples for antibody testing and sent online symptom questionnaires up to 62 days after vaccination. The safety analysis included 588 participants, 85 of whom received the COVID-19 vaccine alone (median age, 71 years; 66% women). Another 357 participants received only the flu vaccine (median age, 55 years; 79% women), and 146 received both (median age, 61 years; 55% women). The immunogenicity analysis included 151 participants, 74 of whom received only the COVID-19 vaccine (median age, 67 years; 61% women). The remaining 77 participants received both vaccines (median age, 60 years; 55% women). COVID-19 and flu vaccines used to be administered separately, but "during the 2022 to 2023 influenza season the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other organizations recommended coadministration of these vaccines, aiming to reduce the burden on the health care system and increase adherence to vaccination," the study authors wrote. Coadministration can improve uptake The incidence of systemic reactions in participants who received only the COVID-19 vaccine was 27.4%, while it was 12.7% in flu-only vaccinees, and 27.6% in those who received both. Relative to the COVID-19 vaccination–alone group, the risk of systemic symptoms was lower in the flu vaccine-only group (odds ratio [OR], 0.17) but comparable in those who received both (OR, 0.82). Postvaccination anti-spike immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody geometric mean titers (GMTs) in the coadministration group were estimated to be 0.84 times lower than in COVID-19–alone recipients. During the 60-day follow-up period in the immunogenicity group, no participants tested positive for COVID-19. The IgG response to vaccination does not necessarily correlate with reduced infectivity of vaccinated HCWs. "Findings from previous immunogenicity and correlates of protection studies suggest that changes in IgG titers to such an extent did not greatly impact vaccine effectiveness, vaccine effectiveness against substantially symptomatic disease, or a SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis risk," the researchers wrote. "However, the rationale behind vaccinating HCWs with booster doses against COVID-19 also takes into account the safety of the patients they are treating, and the IgG response to vaccination does not necessarily correlate with reduced infectivity of vaccinated HCWs," they added. The authors concluded that coadministration of the vaccines is acceptable policy to increase adherence, "as adherence to a single clinic visit will surely be greater than that which can be achieved for 2 separate visits, especially in more vulnerable populations (eg, the elderly)," they wrote. "Coadministration of vaccines is often advocated when disadvantages are marginal or negligible."

In this study, the mosaic vaccine design strategy and genetic algorithms were utilized to optimize the seasonal influenza A virus (H1N1, H3N2) hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) antigens, which also contain most potential T-cell epitopes. These mosaic immunogens were then expressed as virus-like particles (VLPs) using the baculovirus expression system. The immunogenicity and protection effectiveness of the mosaic VLPs were compared to the commercial quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (QIV) in the mice model. Strong cross-reactive antibody responses were observed in mice following two doses of vaccination with the mosaic VLPs, with HI titers higher than 40 in 15 of 16 tested strains as opposed to limited cross HI antibody levels with QIV vaccination. After a single vaccination, mice also show a stronger level of cross-reactive antibody responses than the QIV. The QIV vaccinations only elicited NI antibodies to a small number of vaccine strains, and not even strong NI antibodies to its corresponding vaccine components. In contrast, the mosaic VLPs caused robust NI antibodies to all tested seasonal influenza virus vaccine strains. Here, we demonstrated the mosaic vaccines induces stronger cross-reactive antibodies and robust more T-cell responses compared to the QIV. The mosaic VLPs also provided protection against challenges with ancestral influenza A viruses of both H1 and H3 subtypes. These findings indicated that the mosaic VLPs were a promising strategy for developing a broad influenza vaccine in future.

Both seasonal influenza and influenza pandemics can cause serious diseases and even death, resulting in a severe economic and disease burden1. The most disastrous influenza pandemic in history occurred in 1918, the so-called Spanish pandemic, which has caused ~50 million deaths worldwide followed by continuous seasonal influenza epidemics and periodic pandemic threats in the past several decades2. Vaccination is the best intervention to prevent influenza by decreasing the infection rate and disease severity. Current seasonal vaccines are mainly classified as inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV), live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), and recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV), all of which include three or four specific vaccine strains. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that the overall effectiveness of the influenza vaccine reached 40% in 2018–2019, which prevented approximately several million cases of illness even though there was an antigenic drift of the H3N2 strain during the season3. Notably, influenza vaccination provides better protection for the elderly and those with underlying medication conditions, significantly reducing the all-cause mortality rate4. However, influenza virus genes are composed of segmented negative-stranded RNA and are highly susceptible to antigenic drift and antigenic shift, causing unstable protection of the vaccination5. Vaccines are prepared each year in countries around the world using WHO-predicted pandemic strains, and influenza vaccines are highly effective when the strains match the pandemic strains, while the protection rate of influenza vaccines decreases to varying degrees when the strains do not match. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent influenza, but current vaccination strategies have limitations. Seasonal vaccines, especially IIVs rely on neutralizing anti-HA antibodies, which only protect against similar strains and need updating annually due to antigenic variation. Production cycles are long and complicated with limited capacity, making them inadequate for pandemics. To address the limitations of current vaccine strategies and platforms, we would like to point out that there is an urgent need to optimize them and develop universal influenza vaccines.The HA and NA viral glycoproteins are the primary targets of influenza vaccines and have garnered much interest as potential universal vaccine candidates. Some of these candidates have entered the clinical trials6,7,8,9.The haemagglutinin HA is the most important antigen in influenza vaccines, triggering an immune response and producing antibodies to neutralize the virus. The induction of a broad range of HI and neutralizing antibodies against the structural domains of the HA head and stem is an attractive target for the development of universal influenza vaccines. Vaccines that induce a broad range of antibodies are being developed as new universal influenza vaccines in various countries10,11,12,13. In addition, NA exhibits a slower rate of antigenic drift, which makes its antigenic sites more conservative, and antibodies to NA often show a broader cross-talk14, so optimizing influenza vaccines to improve the targeting of NA, and thus to protect different influenza strains consistently and broadly, is becoming a new direction in the development of universal influenza vaccines.The Mosaic Vaccine Designer will generate candidate vaccine protein cocktails that optimize the coverage, by a small set of mosaic proteins that could be included in a vaccine cocktail, of potential T-cell epitopes in a large diverse set of proteins. The mosaic algorithm has been used to predict therapeutic HIV vaccine candidates15 and has shown promising potential in vivo as a Pan-Filovirus vaccine. In 2014, Kamlangdee et al.16 constructed the first recombinant Ankara poxvirus vaccine expressing H5N1 Mosaic HA using the Mosaic approach. The results showed that the vaccine produced 100% protection against H5 AIV, while eliciting a cross-immune response to H1N1 virus in rhesus monkeys and contributing to the early in vivo clearance of the heterotypic H1N1 virus. In 2021, Bullard’s team17 used the Mosaic approach to design a universal swine H3 influenza vaccine. In mice, H3M vaccination resulted in significant cross-reactivity to various antibodies and T-cell responses, with higher levels of cross-reactive antibodies produced in pigs. In this study, we developed a mosaic vaccine design strategy and genetic algorithms to optimize the HA and NA sequences of human seasonal influenza viruses (H1N1 and H3N2), and we created a HA and NA mosaic cocktail containing the majority of potential T-cell epitopes of seasonal influenza viruses in order to develop a “universal” influenza vaccine. This mosaic VLPs elicits a cross-reactive humoral and cell-mediated immune response in mice models.ResultsDesign and characterization of mosaic VLPsThe basic principle of the mosaic antigen design strategy is to maximize coverage of potential T-cell epitopes found in circulating strains15,18. We have obtained four different Mosaic HA and NA amino acid sequences of H1N1 and H3N2 as described previously via the genetic algorithm of the Mosaic vaccine design strategy13, named H1m, H3m, N1m, and N2m (Supplementary Data), respectively. A maximum-likelihood tree was constructed to evaluate the relationship between these four mosaic immunogens and seasonal influenza virus vaccine strains from 2009 to 2022. The resulting full-length human mosaic HA and NA was analyzed based on their phylogeny and structure (Fig. 1). The identity and similarity of HA and NA amino acid sequences of strains used in this study with the mosaic HA and NA were analyzed (Supplementary Table 1).Fig. 1: Phylogenetic relationship of the last decade of seasonal influenza virus vaccine strains hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA) proteins, and mosaic recombinant antigens.Four mosaic recombinant antigens (H1m, H3m, N1m, and N2m) are marked by red font. H1 (red), H3(pink) virus (A) and N1 (red), N2 (pink) virus (B) phylogenic groups are indicated. Representative strains for each HA and NA subtype were aligned using ClustalW alignment and a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed using iTOL. An asterisk indicates inclusion in this study.Full size imageTo produce the mosaic VLPs, the mosaic HA and NA genes, together with the M1 gene from A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) strain were cloned into pFastBac vectors and transfected to Sf9 cells to generate recombinant baculoviruses (rBVs). The expression of the HAm, NAm, and M1 proteins was confirmed by Immunofluorescence assay. The red Immunofluorescence indicates successful protein expression of HA or NA and the green Immunofluorescence indicates successful protein expression of M1 by the respective recombinant baculovirus (Fig. 2A). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that the VLPs had irregular spikes on their surfaces, which is characteristic of influenza virus HA and NA proteins on virus particles (Fig. 2B). As HA and NA are primary protein that determines the antigenic signature and virulence of influenza viruses, we applied an HA assay to determine HA titer and found the concentrated VLPs had a titer of 2^10 (Fig. 2C). Further using standard fluorescence-based influenza neuraminidase assays, the functional NA enzyme activity of VLPs was confirmed (Fig. 2D). Quantification demonstrated the near absence of residual baculovirus DNA (≤0.65 ng/mL) in the purified mosaic VLPs (Supplementary Fig. 1). In conclusion, we successfully obtained mosaic VLPs of H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses. The obtained mosaic VLPs included viral HA, NA, and M1 proteins with morphological characteristics similar to those of natural viral particles.Fig. 2: Generation and characterization of mosaic VLPs.A Recombinant baculovirus (rBVs) rBac-H1m, rBac-N1m, rBac-H3m, rBac-N2m, and rBac-M1 were successfully identified using immunofluorescence assay (IFA) by HA, NA, and M1-specific antibody in Sf9 cells (×200). The scale bar indicates 20 μm. B The morphology of VLPs similar to natural influenza virions were successfully observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The scale bar indicates 100 nm. C The VLPs could produce 2^10 HA titers, while no HA titer was observed in Mock control group. D Different concentrations of VLPs had relatively high neuraminidase activity, and the neuraminidase activity increased with the increase of VLPs concentration.Full size imageMosaic VLPs elicit robust, broad-spectrum humoral antibody responsesWe next evaluated the immune response stimulated by the mosaic VLPs in mice. We first investigated the antibody response within 35 days after the prime-boost vaccination regimen (Fig. 3). In humans, an HI titer of at least 40 (antibody levels protecting from infection in approximately 50%, is often used as a threshold protective titer) is often used as the protection antibody titer19. Mice with the mosaic VLPs immunogens vaccination resulted in a robust cross-reactive antibody response, with HI titers ≥40 to 7 of the 8 (87.5%) tested H1 strains (Fig. 4A) and 8 of the 8 (100%) H3 tested strains (Fig. 4B), especially A/Hunan/42443/2015, which is a swine influenza virus, with HI titer ≥640. In contrast, the QIV provided limited cross-reactivity with mismatched strains, as shown in the heatmap (Fig. 4). This indicated that the mosaic VLPs vaccine could induce potent cross-reactive immunity against some mismatched strains. Notably, mosaic antigen showed high cross-immunity to all vaccine strains during the last decade, significantly higher than the QIV group. These promising results supported that the mosaic VLPs vaccine could protect against different seasonal influenza viruses circulating in humans over the past decade.Fig. 3: Experimental plan: vaccines, immunizations and challenge studies.Mice received a boost immunization (I.M.) with 1.5 μg of HA content of monovalent mosaic VLP vaccine or 1.5 μg of HA contents of quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (QIV). Animals in the negative control group received PBS. Five weeks after vaccination, mice were intranasally (I.N.) infected with influenza virus containing 10MLD50.Full size imageFig. 4: Mosaic VLPs immunization elicits robust cross-reactive antibody responses in mice against H1- and H3-representative viruses.BALB/c mice were vaccinated with VLPs and compared to QIV-vaccinated mice. The HI antibody response to H1 (A) or H3 (B) representative strains was determined by HI assay in mice immunized with boost immunization. A heatmap of HI titers was further constructed to better visualize cross-reactive antibody response for each vaccine. Data are presented as the mean with standard error (SEM) (n = 5; two-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparison), *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.Full size imageTo further investigate the mosaic NA immunogen response after vaccination in mice, the NA inhibition titer was evaluated by ELLA assay. The results showed that mosaic VLP-vaccinated mice produced higher titers of NI antibodies against all N1 (Fig. 5A) and N2 (Fig. 5B) subtypes of seasonal influenza virus vaccine strains involved in the study over the past decade, indicating that mosaic VLPs induced strong cross-reactive immunity. Compared with the mice immunized with the QIV, it only induced NI antibodies against a few vaccine strains and did not induce potent NI antibodies against their components. In particular, the 2021–2022 QIV (QIV21-22) has no NI antibody titer against A/Victoria/2570/2019 strains, which was also related to the fact that the main component of the influenza vaccine immunogen is HA protein rather than NA protein. We quantified NA content in both QIV and mosaic VLPs to investigate whether the observed difference was attributed to different NA content in the vaccine (Supplementary Fig. 2). Our analysis revealed that N2 of 2020–2021 QIV (QIV20-21) had slightly higher NA content than VLPs, while other NA content of QIV were lower than mosaic VLPs. The heatmap demonstrated a substantial difference in NI titers between Mosaic VLPs and QIV (Fig. 5).Fig. 5: Mosaic VLPs immunization elicits robust cross-reactive antibody responses in mice against N1- and N2-representative viruses.BALB/c mice were vaccinated with VLPs and compared to QIV-vaccinated mice. The NI antibody response to N1 (A) or N2 (B) representative strains was determined by ELLA assay in mice immunized with boost immunization. A heatmap of NI titers was further constructed to better visualize cross-reactive antibody response for each vaccine. Data are presented as the mean with standard error (SEM) (n = 5; two-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparison), *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.Full size imageWe then measured neutralizing antibody titers using MDCK cells to assess the serum-neutralizing antibody levels of each vaccinated mouse. The vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody pattern was consistent with the results based on HI and NI assays, confirming the function of these cross-reactive antibodies (Fig. 6). Micro-neutralizing potency in sera from mice immunized with the mosaic VLPs vaccine was significantly higher than in the PBS group, with 1.3–44.0-fold increases in nAb titers (GMTs) compared to mice immunized with QIV for some strains, respectively. Overall, the Mosaic VLPs vaccine provided comprehensive broad-spectrum neutralizing coverage of most virus strains involved in the experiments.Fig. 6: Mosaic VLPs immunization elicits cross-reactive neutralizing antibody responses in mice against H1N1- and H3N2-representative viruses.BALB/c mice were vaccinated with VLPs and compared to QIV-vaccinated mice. The neutralizing antibody response to H1N1 (A) or H3N2 (B) representative strains was determined by Microneutralization assay in mice immunized with boost immunization. A heatmap of Microneutralization titers was further constructed to better visualize cross-reactive antibody response for each vaccine. Data are presented as the mean with standard error (SEM) (n = 5; two-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparison), *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.Full size imageThe functional binding of vaccine-induced HA or NA antibodies was evaluated by HI, NI, and MN activity using various influenza viruses (Figs. 4–6 and Supplementary Fig. 1). To further investigate the correlates of protection, antibody production in vaccinated mice was evaluated. Levels of vaccine-specific IgG, IgG1, or IgG2a antibodies were measured by ELISA in serum (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4). After the second vaccination, the mosaic VLP vaccines produced high levels of IgG antibodies against all four vaccine strains. Moreover, a strong antibody response against the historical influenza strains (PR8 and X-31) was detectable only in the group that received VLPs, with weaker responses to QIV. To assess the antibody response induced by the mosaic H1 and H3 antigens, serum obtained after vaccination was tested for their capacity to bind to the respective VLP proteins. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 4, the mosaic H1N1 VLP elicited higher antibody titers than the mosaic H3N2 VLP, indicating that the mosaic H1 antigen elicited a better antibody response than the mosaic H3 antigen. Interestingly, the mosaic VLPs induced higher IgG2a antibodies than IgG1 antibodies, while QIV induced more IgG1 antibodies. This suggested that mosaic VLPs elicit a predominantly Th1 cell-dominated immune response in vivo, whereas QIV elicits a Th2 cell-dominated immune response.Mosaic VLPs elicit antigen-specific cellular immune responsesTo evaluate the antigen-specific T-cell responses boosted by VLPs, the splenocytes from mice post 35 days of VLPs, QIV or PBS inoculation were isolated and stimulated with inactivated H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses. T-cell-produced IFN-γ (T-helper 1) and IL-4 (T-helper 2) were measured by ELISpot assay. The expression of cytokines for T cells was quantified by flow cytometry.As shown in Fig. 7, the IFN-γ-secreting cells in the mosaic VLPs vaccine group were significantly higher than those in the PBS group, while IFN-γ secretion was reduced in the QIV group, especially in mice immunized with the QIV20-21 vaccine. The mosaic VLPs vaccine induced a strong T-helper 1-associated T-cell immune response, while the QIV did not elicit a robust antigen-specific T-cell response after vaccination as compared to the PBS (Fig. 7A). At the same time, we observed higher levels of IL-4 expression in all mosaic VLPs groups (Fig. 7B).Fig. 7: Mosaic VLPs immunization elicits T-cell responses in mice against H1N1- and H3N2-representative viruses.A Splenocytes isolated from immunized BALB/c mice in each group on days 35 were plated in ELISpot wells to detect IFN-γ and IL-4 cytokine-producing cells. B, C Splenocytes restimulated with inactive A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) and A/Aichi/2/1968 (X-31) virus, analyzed for cellular immunity using an IFN-γ and IL-4 ELISpot assays. Data are presented as the mean with standard error (SEM) (n = 5; one-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparison), *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.Full size imageWe further explored the CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell response induced by the VLPs vaccine using flow cytometry. The representative flow images of CD8+ IFN-γ+, CD8+ IL-4+, CD8+ TNF-α+, CD8+ IL-2+, and CD4+ IFN-γ+, CD4+ IL-4+, CD4+ TNF-α+, CD4+ IL-2+ T cells under virus A/PR/8/1934 stimulation are shown in Supplementary Fig. 5. The gating strategies are shown in Supplementary Fig. 6. The frequencies of the antigen-specific splenocytes from the dually immunized mice were capable of releasing the cytokines IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-2 were higher than those from QIV or PBS immunized mice, as determined by intracellular cytokine staining (Fig. 8A–H). The same results described above were observed under A/Aichi/2/1968 stimulation (Fig. 8I–P). These results showed that mosaic VLPs elicited substantial cellular immune responses after immunization. Interestingly, the mosaic VLPs vaccine induced a significant T-cell response to the PR8 virus, although it did not elicit a detectable antibody response against this virus (measured by HI and NI titers). Therefore, it is very feasible to select this strain to detect the potential of vaccine-induced T-cell response in the absence of detectable cross-reactive antibodies.Fig. 8: Splenocytes isolated from immunized BALB/c mice in each group on day 35, and T-cell responses were detected by flow cytometry after stimulation of the spleen with virus A/PR/8/1934 (PR8) or A/Aichi/2/1968 (X-31).Shown are detailed results of CD8+ IFN-γ+ T cells (A), CD8+ IL-4+ T cells (B), CD8+ TNF-α+ T cells (C), CD8+ IL-2+ T cells (D), CD4+ IFN-γ+ T cells (E), CD4+ IL-4+ T cells (F), CD4+ TNF-α+ T cells (G), and CD4+ IL-2+ T cells (H) induced by virus PR8 and detailed results of CD8+ IFN-γ+ T cells (I), CD8+ IL-4+ T cells (J), CD8+ TNF-α+ T cells (K), CD8+ IL-2+ T cells (L), CD4+ IFN-γ+ T cells (M), CD4+ IL-4+ T cells (N), CD4+ TNF-α+ T cells (O), and CD4+ IL-2+ T cells (P) induced by virus X-31. Data are presented as the mean with standard error (SEM) (n = 4; one-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparison), *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.Full size imageMosaic VLP-vaccinated mice were protected from lethal challenges with H1N1 and H3N2To examine the protective effect of vaccination, all mice were intranasally challenged with 10 mouse-lethal doses of 50% (MLD50) of A/Puerto Rico/8/34(PR8) and A/Aichi/2/1968 (X-31) 35 days after vaccination. Following the challenge, mice were monitored for 14 consecutive days for weight loss and were humanely sacrificed if a 20% weight loss was achieved. Mice vaccinated with the placebo vaccine (PBS) lost more weight than any other group, a peak weight loss of 10% was reached at 3 days post infection (dpi).This trend was also observed in all other mosaic VLPs vaccine groups, with weight loss peaking at 2 dpi but then rising steadily until 7 dpi, after which weight gain stabilized. When challenged with PR8 or X-31, mosaic VLP-vaccinated mice exhibited 100% survival and experienced only moderate weight loss before recovery (PR8 was 16% (Fig. 9A), X-31 was 12.5% (Fig. 9B), all mice receiving the QIV and PBS vaccines died after the challenge.Fig. 9: The prophylactic activity of mosaic VLPs vaccine in an influenza A virus-challenge model.At 2 weeks post boost immunization, the vaccinated mice were challenged by A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (A) and A/Aichi/2/1968 (B) viruses. Body weight loss and survival rates of mice were recorded every day after the virus challenge for 14 days (n = 5). Mice were sacrificed on day 4 post infection to determine lung viral titer by TCID50 assays. (n = 3, one-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple comparison), *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01.Full size imageTo evaluate the protective effects of mosaic VLPs, the viral loads in the lungs were analyzed at 4 dpi (Fig. 9). The results showed that the mosaic VLPs vaccine groups experienced significantly reduced in viral shedding by historical strains belonging to the H1 and H3 strains. The level of viral shedding in these groups at 4 dpi was significantly lower than in the PBS group (P < 0.001). In contrast, the QIV-vaccinated mice had similar levels of viral shedding in the lungs to those in the PBS group, reaching 10^3.07–3.66 TCID50/mL. Taken together, these data demonstrate that mosaic VLPs vaccine can offer significant protection against the lethal influenza virus challenge.Mosaic VLPs vaccination reduced the inflammatory response in mice lung histopathologyTo further characterize the protection observed in the VLPs or QIV-vaccinated groups, we next examined hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained lung sections harvested at 4 dpi (Supplementary Fig. 7). First, we observed the clinical manifestations of the mice after the challenge. As expected, control mice immunized with the PBS exhibited typical clinical signs such as shaggy hair, body tremors, depression, and loss of appetite after the challenge. Moreover, mice vaccinated with QIV also showed similar clinical signs, with less severe clinical manifestations compared to controls. In contrast, mice immunized with VLPs vaccines did not show significant clinical signs. A comparative histopathological study of the lungs from mice on day 4 after challenge with live IAV strains was performed. In PBS groups and QIV-vaccinated groups, histopathological observations revealed extensive lung tissue damage, such as alveolar wall thickening, connective tissue hyperplasia, massive alveolar detachment with hemorrhage and vascular inflammation, and massive inflammatory cell infiltration (Supplementary Fig. 7A, C, D). However, we observed reduced lung tissue damage in the lungs of mice inoculated with mosaic VLPs, which showed a lighter cellular infiltration and inflammation. In both VLPs groups, damage to the bronchiolar epithelium and signs of alveolar interstitial cell infiltration were minimal compared with PBS and QIV groups, and the presence of bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) around the lung bronchi, a feature that contributes to lung tissue cell recovery (Supplementary Fig. 7B). Overall, histopathological evaluation of lung sections of IAV-challenged mice revealed a high degree of protection by mosaic VLPs vaccines, with evidence of slightly higher protection against pulmonary pathology in mosaic VLPs groups than in QIV groups.DiscussionInfluenza vaccine components must be updated yearly due to the frequent antigenic drift of influenza viruses. Existing influenza vaccines have a narrow protection spectrum and short immune persistence. Therefore, there is an urgent need to improve the traditional influenza virus vaccine and develop a “universal” influenza vaccine. In this study, we evaluated mosaic vaccine design algorithms for broad cross-reactivity of H1N1 and H3N2 for HA, NA immunogen design to create a potential universal influenza A vaccine.In this study, we demonstrate that our mosaic VLPs vaccine induced strong cross-reactivity against various IAV viruses representing the last decade of seasonal influenza viruses and some historical strains. After primary and booster immunization of mice, the mosaic VLPs vaccine induced strong HI cross-reactive antibody titers against 15 of 16 different IAV strains (Fig. 4). In contrast, the QIV showed limited cross-reactivity outside of the strains contained in each vaccine. Moreover, mosaic VLPs vaccination elicited HI antibody titers are much stronger when compared to the QIV. Although an HI titer of 40 is recognized as the threshold antibody titer that reduces the risk of influenza infection by 50%, the stronger the HI titer, the higher the level of protection20. In addition, higher titers are often needed to protect at-risk populations, such as pediatric or elderly populations21,22. Further immunization studies in mice support the excellent cross-reactive immunity induced by the mosaic VLPs vaccine. Importantly, we found that a single immunization with mosaic VLPs induces strong cross-reactive antibody titers, especially for H1N1 subtype strains, while immunity with QIV produces very limited antibodies to mismatched strains (Supplementary Fig. 8). This data shows that the mosaic VLPs can be used as a broad cross-reactive vaccine, and only one immunization may be required to induce strong immunity. Importantly, this data suggests that booster immunization is critical for generating a significant antibody response when administering the commercial vaccine QIV. At the same time, we found that the serum of mice immunized by mosaic VLPs also produced extremely high titers of HI against a swine influenza virus strain A/Hunan/42443/2015(H1N1), even far beyond other seasonal influenza vaccine strains, which suggests that the antigen epitope of our mosaic sequence covers the swine flu strain as well. It is suggested that this VLPs might provide some cross-host protection and transmission. Interestingly, we also observed the mosaic H1N1 subtype VLP vaccine induced much higher levels of cross-reactive antibodies than the mosaic H3N2 subtype VLP vaccine. On average, a twofold higher magnitude of antibody response producing with the H1 subtype than the H3 subtype, despite both antigens being injected at the same dose. This observation may indicate a degree of immune advantage of the mosaic H1 antigen over the mosaic H3 antigen. The result may be partly because the H3N2 subtype tends to change rapidly genetically and antigenically. The current H3N2 subtype has evolved to form many independent and genetically different branches, and a variety of mutant strains spread together, resulting in poorly conserved antigen epitopes and more antigen epitopes losing their function due to mutations. This is also more consistent with the conclusion of the CDC’s vaccine effectiveness observation study conducted on the general population: the vaccine has played a good role in reducing the severity of influenza A H1N1 and influenza B virus infection and outcome, but the degree of protection against Influenza A H3N2 is low23,24. However, the effect of heterosubtypic immunodominance among influenza virus vaccine strains has not been extensively studied, but increasing the dose of the least immunogenic HA subtype could help overcome the limitations of the immune response observed in multivalent vaccine formulations25,26. Therefore, in the future, if a multivalent mosaic VLPs vaccine is developed, it is also an essential task for us to determine the dose ratio of the H1 and H3 antigen mix to optimize the host immune response to both components after vaccination.These functions of neutralization and HI antibody are significant contributors to the traditional protection mediated by seasonal influenza virus vaccines. They may also play a role in the protection provided by novel vaccination methods. We also evaluated the serum-neutralizing antibody potency in vaccinated mice accordingly. The functional nature of vaccine-induced Abs in mosaic VLPs was confirmed by the MN results, which showed an overall correlation with HI titers. Although occasional differences between HI and MN results have been reported, and there is some evidence that MN results may be a more sensitive predictor of child protection27, our data suggest that Abs induced after vaccination with mosaic VLPs both inhibit hemagglutination and prevent viral entry into host cells (neutralization).Neuraminidase (NA) is the second largest surface antigen of influenza viruses, and NA immunity has been indicated as an independent correlate of protection, as demonstrated in the analysis of human samples28. It has been suggested as a complementary antigen to the primary immunodominant hemagglutinin (HA) antigen in influenza vaccines29. Compared to HA, NA is less affected by antigenic drift, induces a strong anti-neuraminidase immune response, and provides broader protection against many influenza virus strains. Many reports have shown that NA protein-induced protection is mediated by NI antibodies14,30,31. Therefore, one goal of developing an NA-based influenza vaccine is its ability to effectively induce NI antibodies to confer protection against influenza viruses32. In this study, we also demonstrated NA-based NI antibody activity and found that mosaic VLPs induced higher titers of cross-protective NA-specific antibodies in mice. The serum of mice vaccinated with mosaic VLPs can inhibit the neuraminidase activity of a variety of influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 strains (7/8 in the N1 subtype; 8/8 in the N2 subtype), while QIV were barely able to induce potent NI antibodies (Fig. 5). Importantly, mosaic VLPs induced a broader spectrum and higher titer NI antibody compared with HI antibody, which correlates with the fact that NA antigens are more conserved and less affected by antigenic drift. Previous studies have found that HA is known to be immunodominant and has a suppressive effect on inducing NA-specific immune responses when both HA and NA antigens are present in the same influenza virus particle, as in inactivated influenza vaccines33. Most NA inhibitory antibodies are considered to mediate non-neutralizing immunity, resulting in infectious protection but significantly reducing disease severity34,35. NA has also been reported to promote HA-mediated cell fusion and viral infection of target cells, indicating the role of NA in viral entry36. In this study, HA protein content was used as the quantitative standard for immunization dose, which made it impossible to compare the immune responses elicited by the NA antigen fraction in each vaccine because the immunized mosaic VLPs and QIV had the same HA content but different NA content. We quantified NA content in QIV and Mosaic VLPs to determine this difference. We demonstrate that mosaic VLPs can induce a broad spectrum of NI antibodies. In addition, mosaic VLPs elicited higher NI titers and broader spectrum NI antibodies, even though the N2 content in VLPs was lower than the NA content in QIV20-21, which was a very surprising finding. A shortcoming of this study is that we do not have a standardized NA for our immunogens measurement. Therefore, whether an independent NA vaccine entity is desirable would also be a direction for us to consider in future.Since HI titers have long been the primary criterion for influenza vaccine licensing, it is unsurprising that most commercially available influenza vaccines (such as TIV or QIV) are designed to induce a robust humoral response. However, most protective responses to viral diseases arise from close cooperation between different immune system elements: innate and adaptive, humoral and cellular37. Although pre-formed antibodies can protect against many viral diseases, T-cell-mediated immunity is generally required to clear most viral infections and maintain long-term immunity effectively. In humans, the development of cross-reactive T cells and memory T cells is associated with lasting immunity to the influenza virus38,39. Moreover, a growing consensus is that T-cell-mediated immunity plays a crucial role in long-term cross-protective immunity against influenza, which is especially important in children and the elderly40,41. In recent years, many studies have also confirmed the critical role of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) in anti-influenza immunity and clearance of influenza viruses38,42,43. Both CD4+44 and CD8+45 T cells have been implicated in contributing synergistically to protection. However, with the except live attenuated vaccine (LAIV), commercial influenza vaccines usually have difficulty inducing a strong antiviral T-cell-mediated immunity46. The ELISpot and flow cytometry results of this study showed that mosaic VLPs could induce influenza virus antigen-specific cellular immunity in mice. Immunization of mice with mosaic VLPs vaccine induced highly cross-reactive T-cell responses to historical virulent strains. Importantly, although mosaic VLPs vaccination did not induce significant HI antibody responses to PR8 and X-31, vaccination induced high T-cell responses to both historical strains and provided complete protection after the lethal challenge. In addition, the pathological examination revealed a significant reduction in lung damage and a maximal decrease in lung virus titers, potentially leading to a decrease in viral shedding and subsequently lowering both intraspecific and interspecific transmission. Furthermore, compared to other vaccinated mice, the spleen lymphocytes of mice immunized with mosaic VLPs induce higher levels of IFN-γ, INF-α, and IL-2, all significantly higher than IL-4, highlighting the robust activation of the CTL immune pathway by our mosaic immunogen.This phenomenon suggested that it mosaic VLPs induces strong Th1 cell-mediated immune response and inflammatory response production, while the high level of secreted IFN-γ inhibits the mediation of Th2 cell immune response. Combined with the results of the challenge protection effect experiments, it is clear that the secretion of cytokine IFN-γ, INF-α and IL-2 can protect experimental mice from a lethal dose of influenza virus. The immune response of Th2 cells can activate immune B cells, which in turn induces the body to produce a large number of antigen-specific antibodies. The antibodies neutralize pathogen molecules and thus protect the body from pathogens. The level of specific IgG2a antibodies induced by VLPs was higher than that of IgG1, as Th1 cells in mice produce IgG2a antibodies. Previous studies have found that IgG2a isotype monoclonal antibodies are more effective than IgG1 isotype antibodies at clearing virus infections47,48,49. Furthermore, the involvement of natural killer (NK) cells50 and the non-neutralizing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) pathway51 may as the potential mechanisms of action by which the VLPs vaccine confers complete protection against lethal challenge from historical strains in mice. A limitation of our study is the lack of further exploration into these relevant immune mechanisms.In this study, we confirmed and extended the above results by describing the short-term cellular responses induced by mosaic VLPs after immunizing mice. In the next step, we will further determine whether mosaic VLPs can induce an efficient and long-term immune response, along with the mechanisms involved. In summary, our work supported the development of VLPs vaccines based on mosaic genetic algorithms for combating influenza viruses. Here, we designed a universal influenza A virus vaccine and demonstrated that mosaic VLPs vaccination induced highly cross-reactive antibody and T-cell responses that protected against in vivo influenza virus challenges with contemporary and historical strains in mice. These data encourage further exploration of multivalent mosaic VLPs-based influenza virus vaccines that induce broad protective immune responses by targeting multiple antigens.MethodsEthics statementThis study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendation in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People’s Republic of China. All experiments were approved by the Office of Research Protection’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and Institutional Review Board at Sun Yat-sen University (approval number: 2022-B013). All experiments involving live viruses and animals were housed in negative-pressure isolators with HEPA filters in biosafety level 2 (BSL2) animal facilities at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Southern Military Theatre by the institutional biosafety manual.VLP productionHemagglutinin and neuraminidase segment sequences of all human H1N1 and H3N2 from 2009 to 2021 used in this study were collected from Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID)and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), including 55,514 sequences of H1, 74,410 sequences of H3, 50,135 sequences of N1, 74,403 sequences of N2. Then, a genetic algorithm was used to optimize each population in turn, in which new recombinants were generated and their epitope coverage was calculated and tested. Finally, four Mosaic recombinant antigen sequences were obtained, as described previously18.H1m gene, H3m gene, N1m gene, and N2m gene, along with the A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) matrix 1 protein (M1) gene, were cloned into the pFastBac expression vector immediately downstream of the polyhedron promoter, respectively. Then transformants were inserted into DH10Bac competent cells and, according to the Bac-to-Bac® manufacturer’s instructions harvested the recombinant baculoviruses (rBVs), named rBV-H1m, rBV-N1m, rBV-H3m, rBV-N2m and rBV-M1, respectively. Three separate recombinant baculoviruses containing HA、NA and M1 genes were used to produce the VLPs. After subculturing three times in Sf9 cells, the supernatant was centrifuged at 2576 × g at 4 °C for 30 min to remove cells. The collected supernatants containing VLPs were concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 11,0934 × g at 4 °C for 2 h. To further purify the particles, fractions containing the VLPs were subjected to a second sucrose gradient centrifugation. Then used PBS resuspend the precipitated particles at 4 °C, and VLPs were further purified through with discontinuous sucrose gradient (20%–30%–60%) at 11,0934 × g at 4 °C for 2 h. Then we assess the amount of residual baculovirus DNA in the preparation by Qubit Fluorometric Quantification.Influenza virusesAll seasonal influenza viruses, including A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) and A/Aichi/2/1968 (X-31), were kindly provided by the National Influenza Center of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC).All influenza viruses were grown in specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated eggs, and the chorioallantoic fluid was stored at −80 °C until use. Viral titers were determined and expressed as 50% tissue culture infective dose(s) (TCID50). All experimental studies with influenza viruses were conducted in biosafety level 2+ (BSL2+) facilities in compliance with the University of Sun Yat-sen Office of Biological Safety.Characterization of VLPsVLPs were characterized using immunofluorescence assay (IFA), hemagglutination (HA), and neuraminidase (NA) activity assays. For IFA, HA antigens expression was detected using anti-influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 HA antibody (GeneTex, USA), NA antigens expression was detected using anti-influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 NA antibody (R&D, USA; Sino Biological, China) was used to confirm the expression of NA antigens, while anti-influenza M1 antibody (Abcam, USA) was used to confirm the expression of M1 antigens. Hemagglutination assay was performed to assess VLPs HA activity and used neuraminidase assay kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, China) to measure the neuraminidase activities of VLPs. HA-containing fractions were confirmed by HA assay. NA-containing fractions were confirmed by the Neuraminidase Assay Kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, China). The preparation of VLP was analyzed by negative-staining transmission electron microscope (TEM) to verify the morphological similarity of the production of the VLPs and the influenza virions.Immunofluorescence assay (IFA)To determine the expression of the HA, NA, and M1 proteins of the rBVs, Sf9 cells were infected with the indicated rBVs at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. Following 48 h of incubation at 27 °C, Sf9 cells were fixed with cold acetone for 10 min. The cells were then incubated with the primary antibodies, including rabbit polyclonal antibody against the H1N1 and H3N2 HA protein (1:500, GTX127357 and GTX127363, GeneTex, USA) and H3N2 NA protein (1:500, 40017-T60, Sino Biological, China), sheep polyclonal antibody against the H1N1 NA protein (1:500, AF4858, R&D, USA) or M1 proteins (1:500, ab22396, Abcam, USA) for 1 h, respectively. After washing with PBS, the secondary antibodies, Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated donkey anti-sheep IgG or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500, ab150113, ab150180 and ab150080, Abcam, USA), were added to the cells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The fluorescence signal was observed under a fluorescence microscope.Immunization and challenges of miceTo investigate the immunogenicity and efficacy of the VLPs in mice, 6-8-week-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) female BALB/c mice were divided into thirteen groups (n = 13). Mice were intramuscularly (i.m.) immunized twice with 1.5 μg of HA contents of each purified VLPs and quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (QIV) in 100 μL of PBS at a 3-week interval. Mosaic VLPs were mixed evenly with 70,000 units /mL of IL-2 and 0.1% chitosan (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Blood samples were collected at weeks 3 and 5 post vaccinations. Two weeks after the second immunization, all mice were intranasally challenged with 10 mouse-lethal doses 50% (MLD50) of the H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses in 50 μL of PBS. Three mice per group were euthanized and collected lungs at 4 dpi, and a TCID50 assay was performed to determine the virus titer. All mice were observed twice daily for clinical signs for 14 dpi to monitor body weight changes and mortality, 20% body weight loss was determined to be the humane intervention point, and mice reaching this endpoint were euthanized by inhalation of carbon dioxide and counted in mortality.Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assayTo determine HI antibody titers in vaccinated mice, sera samples were initially diluted 1:10 in the receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) (Denka Seiken, Japan) at 37 °C for 16 h and inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min. HI, the assay was performed using 1% chicken or guinea pig erythrocytes with 4 HA units of viruses according to standard protocols provided by the WHO. The HI titers were recorded as the highest serum dilution that showed completely inhibited hemagglutination.Neuraminidase inhibition (NI) assayNeuraminidase inhibition (NI) was measured using enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA) in serum from immunized mice, as described previously52. Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with fetuin protein (25 μg/mL, 100 μL/well) in carbonate coating buffer, and incubated at 4 °C for more than 18 h. After washing and blocking, 96-well plates were incubated with serial dilutions of immune serum and influenza virus at 37 °C for 16 h. Upon 2 h after incubation with peroxidase-bound peanut lectin (1 μg/mL), 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) was added, and OD 450 nm was measured to determine NI. The 50% inhibition percentage was defined as a serum concentration that produced at least 50% inhibition compared with the virus-only control.Microneutralization (MN) assayTo determine neutralization antibody titers in vaccinated mice, sera samples were treated with RDE at 37 °C for 16 h and inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min. Serially diluted sera reacted with 100 TCID50 influenza virus at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 1 h, then added MDCK cells were in the virus-serum mixture and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 18 h. After fixation with cold acetone, cells were incubated successively with an anti-influenza virus A antibody (1:4000, AB1074, Millipore, USA) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (HRP-IgG) antibody (1:4000, FDG007, FDbio, China). TMB substrate was used to determine the microneutralization titers by measuring the OD450 nm value.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)Highly binding polystyrene ELISA plates (Corning, USA) were coated with 5 μg/mL of the respective purified inactivated virus or VLPs in ELISA Coating Buffer (Solarbio, China) overnight at 4 °C. The following day, plates were blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS with 0.05% Tween (PBST) for 60 min at RT and then incubated with diluted serum samples overnight at 4 °C. After incubation, plates were incubated with the respective secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a (1:4000, 1036-05, 1071-05, and 1081-05, SouthernBiotech, USA) for 1 h at RT and added 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) developing solution (Solarbio, China) for 30 min. The plate was read at 450 nm on a plate reader (Thermo, USA).Enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay100 μL anti-mouse IFN-γ or IL-4 monoclonal antibody (15 μg/mL) (CT655-10 and CT657-10, U‐Cytech, Netherlands) was coated on ELISpot 96-well plates (Millipore, USA) incubated at 4 °C overnight, followed by blocking with 200 μL 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS at room temperature for 2 h. Mouse splenocytes were isolated, 4 × 105 cells/well were added to ELISpot 96-well plate, and then splenocytes were stimulated with inactivated PR8 or X-31 viruses at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 28 h. After incubation, the splenocytes were removed, and biotin-conjugated anti-IFN-γ or anti-IL-4 antibody (CT655-10 and CT657-10, U‐Cytech, Netherlands) was added and subsequently incubated with streptavidin-ALP at room temperature for 1 h. Finally, after incubation in the 5-bromo-4chloro-3-indolyl-phosphateitro blue tetrazolium (BCIP/NBT) substrate solution for 20 min, the ELISpot Reader System (Mabtech, Sweden) was used to detect the number of spots.Flow cytometry and intracellular cytokine stainingThe expression of cytokines was evaluated using flow cytometry for T cells in single-cell suspensions from the spleen. Splenocytes were stimulated in medium containing 10 μg/mL purified A/PR/8/1934 or A/Aichi/2/1968 virus for 2 h, and added BFA to incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. The cells were stained with murine antibodies for the phenotype (KO525-CD3, FITC-CD4, and AF700-CD8), and cytokine expression (PC7-IFN-γ, APC-IL-4, PE-TNF-α, and BV421-IL-2), and a dead or live cell dye ECD-Zombie Red was also used (100234, 100405, 100729, 505825, 504105, 506305, 503825 and 423110, Biolegend, USA). Finally, the cells were collected by CytoFLEX S Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter, USA), and the data were analyzed by CyExpert 2.4 (Beckman Coulter, USA) and FlowJo V10.8 (Tree Star, USA).Histological examination of the mice’s lungPreparation of lung tissue of infected or uninfected mice by formalin fixation, paraffin embedding, and sectioning. Then the samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, respectively.Statistical analysisGraphPad Prism 8 software was used to analyze all data.

By JUDY SIEGEL-ITZKOVICH SEPTEMBER 5, 2023 15:32 Updated: SEPTEMBER 5, 2023 18:24 People wearing protective suits collect dead birds, as there is a major outbreak of bird flu, in Vadso municipality in Finnmark in Norway, July 20,2023 (photo credit: REUTERS) A subtype of the avian (bird) flu virus, found in poultry farms in China, is undergoing mutational changes that could increase the risk of the zoonotic disease being passed on to humans, according to a new Chinese/British study.The researchers said their findings raise concerns of a potential epidemic or pandemic in the making and that concerted research is urgently needed to closely monitor it.The results, which have been published in Cell under the title “Airborne transmission of human-isolated avian H3N8 influenza virus between ferrets,” reports on the characterization of a human isolate from the H3N8 avian influenza virus (AIV). The virus in China caused two confirmed human infections in 2022, followed by a fatal case reported this year. Virus can cause acute respiratory distress syndromeUsing lab mice and ferrets as models for human infection, the study found that the virus has undergone several adaptive changes, causing severe animal infections and making it transmissible by air between animals. A dark-eyed junco bird. (credit: Wikimedia Commons)People, even when vaccinated against human H3N2 virus, appear immunologically naïve to emerging mammalian-adapted H3N8 AIVs, and could be highly vulnerable to infection, said Prof. Jinhua Liu of the China Agricultural University in Beijing.In humans, the avian H3N8 virus infection has been found to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome and can even be fatal. The virus is widespread in chicken flocks, but until now, the features of how it might be transmitted from animals to humans have been poorly understood.“We show that an avian H3N8 virus isolated from a patient with severe pneumonia replicated efficiently in human bronchial and lung epithelial cells, was extremely harmful in its effects in laboratory mammalian hosts, and could be passed on through respiratory droplets,” said Prof. Kin-Chow Chang of the University of Nottingham. “Importantly, we discovered that the virus had acquired human receptor binding preference and amino acid substitution PB2-E627K, which are necessary for airborne transmission. Human populations, even when vaccinated against human H3N2 virus, appear immunologically naïve to emerging mammalian-adapted H3N8 AIVs and could be vulnerable to infection at epidemic or pandemic proportions,” said Liu.“Acid resistance of influenza virus is also an important barrier for avian influenza virus to overcome to acquire the adaptability and transmissibility in new mammals or humans,” Liu continued. “The current novel H3N8 virus has not acquired the acid resistance yet. So, we should pay attention to the change of acid resistance of the novel H3N8 virus.” Sign up for the Health & Wellness newsletter >> Related Tags health China scientific study bird flu Hot Opinion Change the climate: Israel’s environmental potential at COP29 and regional impact By JPOST EDITORIAL To recover, Democrats must expel anti-Zionist extremists who put off Middle America By AMOTZ ASA-EL Leaders of the Jewish enemies have always died as weak cowards By URI PILICHOWSKI How will the recent US election affect Iran, Russia, and North Korea?

Hmm! — Plus: why I still mask in some, but not all, public situations by Jeremy Faust, MD September 6, 2023 MedpageToday Share on Facebook. Opens in a new tab or window Share on X. Opens in a new tab or window Share on LinkedIn. Opens in a new tab or window email article I attended the U.S. Open over the weekend in New York. Apparently, there's "something going around" the Open; it has been reported that a handful of tennis players have experienced a variety of viral symptoms. The thing is, nobody knows whether it's COVID. Players are no longer required to test for it. That said, TV commentator John McEnroe said he'd tested positive for the coronavirus after being on the premises all tournament long. It's a bit conspicuous that the one famous person who doesn't have tons of money riding on how far he goes into the tournament decided to get tested for COVID -- and to reveal the results to the public. I'd wager that at least some of the players with illnesses that some are calling "a flu," really have COVID. The better players who got sick early in the competition were probably hoping that they could power their way through the initial rounds and be on the mend in time for the later rounds of the tournament when the matches get a lot tougher. 'A Flu' May or May Not Be 'The Flu' I couldn't help but notice a turn of phrase being used. Check it out: "I think I got a flu or something." "I'm a zombie because I have a flu." Notice something here? "A flu" as opposed to "the flu." There's long been a misunderstanding here. Not every flu-like illness is influenza. Many viruses share the same symptoms as influenza, but are less dangerous and last for shorter periods. Influenza A and influenza B can cause some pretty serious suffering, albeit so can other viruses whose names you've likely never heard of. But in 2023, I think we should be a little more specific. If you have a cold or a flu-like illness, you probably should not be around vulnerable people -- or at least wear a good mask and be very careful with hand hygiene. If you have lab-confirmed influenza A or B (the "real" flu) or COVID, you definitely should not be around vulnerable people. Now, a bunch of world-class athletes are probably not the highest-risk group. But there are coaches, and families, and tennis-legend-turned-TV commentators like McEnroe to consider. My feeling is that if players are sick, they should take some precautions -- perhaps masking at press conferences or skipping indoor events. This is both good public health citizenship and, in the year 2023, also just polite common sense. Is 'I'm Not Contagious' Good Enough? If the COVID-19 pandemic taught us anything, it's that asymptomatic transmission is probably more common than we previously appreciated. At-home antigen tests have shown us that many people remain at least somewhat contagious for 7 to 14 days, even if feeling better. People used to throw around terms like, "I'm not contagious," based on vague misunderstandings (if not misinformation) about communicable diseases. A lot of people internalized the notion that if you got sick but you haven't had a fever for a day or two, they're no longer contagious. That's pretty dubious. It might be true. It might not be. We know it's not true for COVID. And it's probably not true for influenza either. I was speaking with my colleague Michael Mina, MD, PhD, about this recently. We agree that we know more about COVID than almost any other pathogen humans have ever encountered. It's likely that other pathogens are contagious to some degree for far longer than commonly appreciated. There haven't been millions of people who have taken rapid antigen tests for influenza every couple of days for 2 weeks the way many have done for COVID. If enough people did that (i.e., if such tests were commonly available) we'd probably find out that the CDC guidance on influenza isolation is basically useful, if not airtight. That is, isolating for 4 to 5 days after flu symptom onset reduces most transmission. But I bet it's nowhere near all, and immunocompromised people might shed these viruses longer and be more susceptible to falling ill in the face of less intense exposures (i.e., getting infected despite encountering less virus for less time). We should be studying these questions not just for COVID but for all major respiratory illnesses we routinely encounter. How I Handle Traveling -- and Life -- in 2023 I flew down to New York entirely for recreational purposes this time. I had not attended the U.S. Open in many years, a result of the pandemic and having moved to Boston full-time (Oh, and having kids -- which tends to curb such extravagances). But I love going to the Open, and I'd been wanting to get back to attending. So, some colleagues and I made plans to make the trip. To answer the big question: yes, I still wear a mask in high-risk settings when I travel (and at home). It may seem like a contradiction to wear a mask for 95% of a plane ride (taking it off for 5% of the time to sip some coffee), or to put one on in the subway, only to then dine indoors for 2 hours (which I did do for one meal while in New York) with no mask in sight. And I didn't wear a mask in my tennis stadium seats (outdoors, not that crowded). But I did put one on when I used the restroom there (indoors, crowded, and kinda gross, right?). Putting on a mask in some crowded settings but not others is not a contradiction, nor is it virtue signaling, nor an exercise in futility; it is harm reduction. Taking this measure (and upping my hand hygiene game) continues to help me avoid the sheer inconvenience of getting sick, to say nothing of any misery or health risks I may face. As I told Slate recently, "I have stuff I want to do next week." So for me, it's all about choices. If I get COVID because of a wonderful late-night dinner in a fairly uncrowded restaurant in New York with three excellent friends, I won't feel cheated by the universe. It would be a consequence of a conscious choice I made. But if I got COVID from the subway, that wouldn't feel like a good bargain. Bottom line: I still have never gotten COVID -- though I'm not sure how long that will last. For all I know, I just got it in New York and I'll be reporting back to you in a few days on that. But I believe that at least some of my track record reflects having been careful in high-risk places, picking my battles, and throwing on my mask when doing so literally costs me nothing. I'm not trying to get sick, and I'm not trying to spread viruses of any kind to my family, friends, and patients. The pandemic made me more attuned to this. That's a good thing.

Contact Simona Combi Public Relations Manager 571-527-3982 simona.combi@ncoa.org Located in all 50 states, centers will reach a diverse, underserved population Arlington, VA (Sept 7, 2023) — The National Council on Aging (NCOA), the national voice for every person’s right to age well, is contracting with up to 150 senior centers to administer updated COVID-19 and flu vaccines this fall, as part of its Vaccine Uptake Initiative, funded by the U.S. Administration for Community Living. “New strains of COVID and flu are already circulating, and we know that older adults continue to be at higher risk of getting ill from these viruses,” said Ramsey Alwin, NCOA president and CEO. “Senior centers are trusted messengers in their communities, and they have what it takes to make sure older adults stay protected this respiratory season.” Participating senior centers will receive $10,000 each, and they will be required to administer a minimum of 100 COVID-19 and/or flu shots to older adults and people with disabilities. The centers will target diverse and hard-to-reach populations, including communities of color, rural individuals, and Spanish speakers. “Senior centers are nimble, and they know how to reach the older adults in their communities—including those who may be hesitant about vaccinations,” said Dianne Stone, Associate Director of Network Development and Engagement. “This investment will enable them to support older adults with vaccine appointments and host vaccination clinics.” The 150 senior centers will join the 180 community-based organizations that NCOA selected earlier this year as grantees for the Vaccine Uptake Initiative. The 180 grantees will administer a total of 317,000 COVID-19 and flu vaccines. This COVID-19 and Influenza Vaccine Uptake Initiative for Older Adults and People with Disabilities Notice of Funding Opportunity (HHS-2023-ACL-AOA-HDRC-0043) is supported by the Administration for Community Living (ACL), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as part of a financial assistance award totaling $50 million with 100% funding by ACL/HHS.

This year, there are more vaccine options to consider that are designed to prevent serious illness from flu, COVID and RSV. “All three are, in general, strongly recommended for the populations they’re intended for,” said Dr. Payal Patel, an infectious disease physician at Intermountain Health in Utah. After last winter’s flu, COVID and RSV tripledemic threatened public health and the stability of the U.S. health care system, doctors are urging virtually everyone to get vaccinated against the flu and COVID and for people to talk to their health care providers about whether the newly available RSV vaccine is right for them. The PBS NewsHour asked public health experts for advice on who should get which vaccine dose and when. Click to ask your questions about COVID, RSV and flu. Influenza Each year, the flu poses a deadly threat – preliminary federal data suggest the virus put as many as 650,000 people in the hospital and caused up to 58,000 deaths during the last flu season. First developed during World War II for the U.S. military, an annual dose of the flu vaccine has been shown to be safe and effective for anyone who is 6 months or older, said Dr. Paul Offit, who directs the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “The flu virus evolves so much from one year to the next that it really requires a yearly vaccine,” Offit said. Infectious disease experts monitor the flu virus globally as it moves across seasons and hemispheres. In anticipation of the virus emerging, different flu strains are selected to make up the vaccine for the upcoming season. Over the last two decades, Offit said scientists and epidemiologists have rarely chosen the wrong combination of flu strains for a new season, but he added that “a miss is a mile,” leaving people’s immune systems ill-prepared for preventing severe outcomes. Going into this fall and winter’s flu season, “We expect a good match,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “There’s no signal at this point that there’s going to be a mismatch.” Chart by Megan McGrew/PBS NewsHour Because the vaccine’s immunity-boosting protection can fade across the course of a few months, Adalja recommends that people get their flu shots in early October. However, it’s fine to receive a dose in late September if you’re facing scheduling demands or other health concerns, Adalja said. People who are age 65 or older should request a higher dose tailored to offer them even more protection, he said. Children age 8 or younger who have not yet received any flu vaccine will need to receive two doses, said Dr. William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Some patients complain about getting sick with the flu even after they have been vaccinated, Schaffner said, but he urges them not to worry too much, so long as they are able to stay home with their aches and sniffles. “If you don’t expect perfection, you won’t be disappointed,” Schaffner said. “The flu vaccine is designed to keep you out of the hospital.” COVID In May, when the Biden administration ended the nation’s three-year-old public health emergency, some Americans may have felt like they no longer had to worry about COVID. While severe illness in the U.S. fell across the spring, hundreds have still died every week since then. In recent weeks, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have reported an uptick in COVID hospitalizations. COVID has not disappeared, Schaffner said. COVID appears to mutate and evolve more rapidly than influenza, Schaffner said. That means public health officials and communities still need to remain vigilant, monitor the efficacy of vaccines and utilize boosters to shore up protections against this virus. READ MORE: Biden says he will request more funding for a new COVID-19 vaccine Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax have each developed a COVID monovalent vaccine updated to protect against the newer omicron subvariant XBB.1.5, and regulators at the Food and Drug Administration have vetted the changes, recommending the updated vaccine for people ages 6 months and older. During a Sept. 12 meeting of CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, public health experts gave a 13-1 vote to support the use of the next COVID formulation for everyone ages 6 months and up. The shots could be available nationwide as early as mid-September. “We’re in the strongest position yet to fight COVID,” said Mandy Cohen, director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as the meeting deliberations began. But, she added, “This virus continues to keep us humble. It continues to change.” Looking at an uptick in COVID infections, experts during the CDC meeting said that individuals could wait three months after infection before receiving the updated vaccine, but that was not required. Unlike earlier in the COVID pandemic, people can now get vaccinated as soon as they feel better. RSV Each year, respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, tends to infect young children and seniors, and is particularly deadly in the latter group. As many as 10,000 older adults are estimated to die annually from this illness. It’s also the leading cause for hospitalization for kids under age 5. “This is an underappreciated virus,” Schaffner said. In 2022, the nation was hit with what some people called a tripledemic, in which RSV, COVID and the flu all surged at roughly the same time. It was a terrible coincidence that strained health care systems and sent a flood of patients to emergency departments for respiratory distress. That surge made developing and deploying a vaccine against RSV all the more urgent. READ MORE: RSV vaccine for pregnant women protects their newborns but is it ready for sale? Though RSV was discovered in the 1950s, vaccines to prevent this life-threatening illness had not been created and approved until this year. To prevent the worst outcomes, the FDA and CDC have approved RSV vaccines for individuals age 60 or older, infants and toddlers and pregnant people. A single dose of Abrysvo is available between 32 and 36 weeks of pregnancy and protects both the parent and fetus. Clinical trial data showed it reduced the risk of severe complications for a newborn by more than 80 percent within three months of birth. Because this vaccine is new, researchers and doctors are still figuring out how much durable protection it can offer to a person’s immune system. But early evidence suggests this vaccine may last beyond a single RSV season, which would be a relief for patients as well as the experts who try to keep us healthy. Editor’s note: This article was updated after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices meeting to reflect the latest recommendations and approval of the updated COVID vaccine.

In the US alone, over 60 million agricultural birds have been affected, along with thousands of wild birds. So far, only a few cases have been detected in humans, and many experts think that for now, it is unlikely to spread to people in wide outbreaks. People still have to be directly infected by a bird, and cannot transmit the virus to other people. However, H5N1 is not the only type of bird flu. One subtype called H3N8 has been identified in poultry farms in China. Scientists have now found genetic changes that have been happening in this virus, which may increase the risk it poses to humans. The findings have been reported in Cell. The study authors are concerned that H3N8 could lead to an epidemic or pandemic, and that these viruses have to be closely monitored. H3 flu viruses have been shown to infect dogs, cats, humans, horses, poultry, pigs, seals, and wild aquatic birds. H3N8 was detected in horses in North America in 1963, in North American waterbirds in 2002, and in dogs in 2006. It was isolated from a human patient for the first time in 2022; a four-year-old boy in China, whose family raised chickens at home, contracted the virus. It was determined that the child was infected directly by a bird, and the child could not spread the virus to another person. The patient recovered, as did another person in China who fell ill with H3N8 in 2022. In April 2023, another individual in China was infected with H3N8, and died. This patient was a 56-year-old woman who had multiple underlying conditions, and was frequently exposed to wild birds. She also did not transmit the virus to any other people. The virus was isolated from the patient who died, and researchers have carefully analyzed it. They also studied it in mouse and ferret models. This work revealed that several mutational changes have arisen in the H3N8 genome that can lead to more severe infections in both animal models, and which also made it transmissible between animals, through the air. Right now, the virus has the potential to cause severe respiratory disease and potentially death in humans. While many animals in poultry flocks carry this virus, we still don't know a lot about how it could make the leap from infecting animals to infecting humans, and being transmissible from one human to another. However, the virus seems to have the potential to become a problem. The avian H3N8 virus that was isolated from the patient, who had severe pneumonia, was able to efficiently replicate in both human bronchial and lung epithelial cells. It also had "extremely harmful" effects on laboratory animals and was passed on in respiratory droplets, noted study co-author Professor Kin-Chow Chang of the University of Nottingham. "Importantly, we discovered that the virus had acquired human receptor binding preference and amino acid substitution PB2-E627K," added Chang. These changes are required for the virus to move through the air to another host. Even if people have been vaccinated for the H3N2 flu that infects poeple, they seem to have no protection against this emerging H3N8 avian flus, and people may be vulnerable at the epidemic or pandemic level, said Chang. "Acid resistance of influenza virus is also an important barrier for avian influenza virus to overcome to acquire the adaptability and transmissibility in new mammals or humans. The current novel H3N8 virus has not acquired the acid resistance yet. So, we should pay attention to the change on acid resistance of the novel H3N8 virus," added senior study author Professor Jinhua Liu of China Agricultural University.

StudyBy IANS05 September, 2023TWC IndiaRepresentational Image(Nitin Sharma/BCCL Chandigarh)A subtype of avian flu virus, endemic in poultry farms in China, is undergoing mutational changes, which could increase the risk of the disease being passed on to humans, warns a study.Researchers in China and Nottingham, the UK, also said that the findings raise concerns of a potential epidemic or pandemic in the making and that concerted research is necessary to closely monitor such viruses in poultry and humans.The results, published in the journal Cell, report on the characterisation of a human isolate of the H3N8 avian influenza virus (AIV).Using laboratory mice and ferrets as models for human infection, the study found that the virus has undergone several adaptive changes to cause severe animal infections making it transmissible by the airborne route between animals.In humans, the avian H3N8 virus infection has been found to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome and can even be fatal.The virus is widespread in chicken flocks; however previously, the features of how it might be transmitted from animals to humans is poorly understood.“We demonstrate that an avian H3N8 virus isolated from a patient with severe pneumonia replicated efficiently in human bronchial and lung epithelial cells, was extremely harmful in its effects in laboratory mammalian hosts and could be passed on through respiratory droplets,” said Professor Kin-Chow Chang from at the University of Nottingham.Chang said that his team discovered that the virus had acquired human receptor binding preference and amino acid substitution PB2-E627K, which are necessary for airborne transmission.Advertisement“Human populations, even when vaccinated against human H3N2 virus, appear immunologically naïve to emerging mammalian-adapted H3N8 AIVs and could be vulnerable to infection at epidemic or pandemic proportions,” Chang said."Acid resistance of influenza virus is also an important barrier for avian influenza virus to overcome to acquire the adaptability and transmissibility in new mammals or humans. The current novel H3N8 virus has not acquired acid resistance yet. So, we should pay attention to the change in acid resistance of the novel H3N8 virus,” added Professor Jinhua Liu at the China Agricultural University in Beijing.H3N8 viruses are commonly detected globally in animals.The viruses are some of the most commonly found subtypes in birds, causing little to no sign of disease in either domestic poultry or wild birds.Cross-species transmission of A(H3N8) avian influenza viruses has been reported for various mammal species, including being endemic in dogs and horses.The global health body states that zoonotic influenza type A infections may cause diseases ranging from mild upper respiratory infection (fever and cough) to rapid progression to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock, and even death.Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, the WHO has stressed the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses which may affect human (or animal) health.**The above article has been published from a wire source with minimal modifications to the headline and text.

ZUBAIR SALEEM September 9, 2023 7:19 am No Comments For the past few days, many of my patients have been inquiring about the flu shot or influenza vaccine. Given that it’s the appropriate time and holds significant importance, let’s understand more about this vaccine. The influenza vaccine, commonly known as the flu shot, is a vaccine that provides protection against influenza viruses, which can cause the flu. Here are some key points about the influenza vaccine: What is the influenza vaccine? The influenza vaccine is a vaccine specifically designed to protect against the influenza virus, which causes seasonal flu outbreaks. When is the appropriate time for it? In most countries, the influenza vaccine is recommended and typically administered annually, before the start of the flu season. The timing may vary depending on the region. In Kashmir it’s often recommended in the fall, usually in September and mid October. But better to do it as soon as possible. What is the appropriate vaccine? The flu vaccines should be of 2023-2024 season as they have been upgraded and ideally should be quadrivalent (containing four components). The maintenance of the cold chain is very essential for the efficacy of the vaccine. Who can get the influenza vaccine? In general, the influenza vaccine is recommended for most people, including: • Children over six months of age • Adults of all ages • Seniors • Pregnant women (inactivated flu vaccine) • Individuals with certain underlying medical conditions (e.g., asthma, diabetes, heart disease) • Healthcare workers and caregivers • Anyone who wants to reduce their risk of getting the flu or spreading it to others Who should not get the influenza vaccine? While the influenza vaccine is safe for most people, there are some exceptions. However, in general, the following groups should not get the vaccine without medical advice: • Individuals with a severe, life-threatening allergy to any component of the vaccine (e.g., eggs or other vaccine ingredients) • People who have had a severe allergic reaction to a previous flu vaccine • Those who have developed Guillain-Barré Syndrome within six weeks of a previous flu vaccine • Children under six months of age (vaccine not approved for this age group) • During Fever or any infection. It’s essential to consult your doctor regarding the influenza vaccine, especially if you have specific health concerns or questions about its appropriateness for you or your family members. Why is Flu Shot important for the elderly? The flu shot, also known as the influenza vaccine, is especially important for elderly individuals for several compelling reasons: Reduced Immune Function: As people age, their immune systems tend to weaken, making them more vulnerable to infections like influenza. The flu can lead to serious complications, such as pneumonia, which can be life-threatening for seniors. Higher Risk of Severe Illness: Elderly individuals are more likely to experience severe flu symptoms and complications, including hospitalization and death. The flu can exacerbate underlying health conditions that are common among seniors, such as heart disease and respiratory issues. Protecting Vulnerable Populations: Getting the flu shot helps protect not only the elderly but also other vulnerable populations. Seniors can inadvertently transmit the virus to children, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems, putting them at risk. Preventing Outbreaks in Communities: Widespread vaccination among seniors can contribute to community immunity, reducing the overall spread of the flu virus. This helps protect individuals who may not be able to get vaccinated themselves. Maintaining Quality of Life: The flu can be debilitating for anyone, but for the elderly, it can lead to a significant decline in their quality of life. Vaccination can prevent this decline by reducing the risk of illness. Ease of Access: Many healthcare facilities and pharmacies offer flu shots, making it convenient for elderly individuals to get vaccinated. Some places even offer home visits or clinics at senior centers. Yearly Updates: The influenza virus mutates and changes each year, which is why the flu shot is updated annually to provide protection against the most prevalent strains. Getting vaccinated yearly ensures that seniors are protected against the current strains. Are seniors with specific underlying health conditions or chronic diseases at a higher risk of severe complications from the flu? Elderly individuals with certain underlying health conditions or chronic diseases are at a higher risk of experiencing severe complications if they contract the flu. Therefore, it is particularly important for seniors with the following conditions to get a flu shot: Heart Disease: Seniors with heart conditions, including coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and other cardiovascular issues, should receive the flu vaccine. Influenza can strain the heart, leading to exacerbation of heart problems. Respiratory Conditions: Those with chronic respiratory conditions like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, or bronchitis are at greater risk of respiratory complications from the flu. The vaccine can help prevent these issues. Diabetes: Seniors with diabetes have compromised immune systems, making them more susceptible to infections like the flu. High blood sugar levels can also make it harder to recover from illnesses. Kidney Disease: Individuals with chronic kidney disease, especially those on dialysis, are at an increased risk of complications from the flu. The vaccine can help protect their weakened immune systems. Weakened Immune Systems: Elderly individuals who have weakened immune systems due to conditions like cancer or HIV/AIDS, or due to medications like immunosuppressants, should get the flu shot to reduce their risk of infection. Neurological Conditions: Certain neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson’s disease, can make it more challenging for the body to fight off infections. Vaccination is important for those with these conditions. Stroke Survivors: Individuals who have had a stroke may have weakened immune systems or other health issues that increase their susceptibility to flu-related complications. Obesity: Obesity is considered a risk factor for severe influenza complications. Seniors with a high body mass index (BMI) should consider getting vaccinated. Residents of Long-Term Care Facilities or living alone: Seniors residing alone or in long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes or assisted living facilities, are at a higher risk of flu outbreaks. They should be vaccinated to protect themselves and others in their community. Leave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.

Josh Shapiro and the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture announced Aug. 30 that Pennsylvania is recognized by the World Animal Health Organization as free of highly pathogenic avian influenza. This official status means that, for the first time since April 2022, Pennsylvania can return to normal international trade conditions. Trade had been restricted after the outbreak of the current HPAI string affected 31 commercial flocks, 36 backyard flocks and caused the loss of 4.6 million domestic birds. The last confirmed infection of the bird flu in Pennsylvania was on March 17, in Lancaster County. In early August, specific restrictions on farms where infections had been confirmed were finally lifted. Pennsylvania remains under a general quarantine and the department will continue to test and monitor statewide. Despite no detections of the most infectious strain of the virus in recent months, detections of the virus in surrounding states indicate the threat is still present, especially as wild bird migration season approaches. Currently, the Department is still reviewing applications for the fifth round of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Recovery Reimbursement Grants, which will reimburse those in the industry for the costs of enhanced biosecurity necessary to protect against the virus. It is recommended poultry producers continue to implement strict biosecurity practices at all times, monitor bird health and report any unexplained illnesses and deaths in a flock to 717-772-2852.

Published this week in the research journal Cell, the study focuses on characterising the H3N8 avian influenza virus (AIV) isolated from a human patient. Using laboratory mice and ferrets as human infection models, the research reveals significant adaptive changes in the virus, allowing it to cause severe animal infections and become airborne-transmissible between animals. “We demonstrate that an avian H3N8 virus isolated from a patient with severe pneumonia replicated efficiently in human bronchial and lung epithelial cells, was extremely harmful in its effects in laboratory mammalian hosts and could be passed on through respiratory droplets,” said Professor Kin-Chow Chang, at the University of Nottingham. “Importantly, we discovered that the virus had acquired human receptor binding preference and amino acid substitution PB2-E627K, which are necessary for airborne transmission. Human populations, even when vaccinated against human H3N2 virus, appear immunologically naïve to emerging mammalian adapted H3N8 AIVs and could be vulnerable to infection at epidemic or pandemic proportion,” said Chang. Titled “Airborne transmission of human-isolated avian H3N8 influenza virus between ferrets”, the study was a collaborative effort between the University of Nottingham, China Agricultural University in Beijing, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. In humans, avian H3N8 virus infection has been linked to acute respiratory distress syndrome and even fatalities. While the virus is prevalent in chicken flocks, the precise mechanisms of its transmission to humans have remained poorly understood. “Acid resistance of influenza virus is also an important barrier for avian influenza virus to overcome to acquire the adaptability and transmissibility in new mammals or humans. The current novel H3N8 virus has not acquired the acid resistance yet. So, we should pay attention to the change on acid resistance of the novel H3N8 virus,” said Chang.

Flu can be deadly." The flu season is expected to come early this year and be especially harsh on kids.With a new COVID shot and new RSV vaccines rolling out this fall, experts say don't miss a chance to get your flu shot. The flu is expected to come early and be especially harsh on kids."Flu is not just a common cold. Flu can be deadly," said Dr. David Bronstein with Kaiser Permanente Antelope Valley.The Southern Hemisphere already had their flu season, and infectious disease experts say it was awful."It really affected kids this year in Australia, lots of kids getting sick and getting hospitalized. They even called it the 'kindy flu,' because so many kids were being affected," he said.Bronstein said this year's quadrivalent flu vaccine appears to be a good match for what's heading our way."You have protection against the two dominant strains of flu A, so H3N2 and H1N1, as well as protection against two different strains of flu B," Bronstein said.MORE: What to know about RSV vaccines as pharmacies begin rolloutThis fall, you will need your yearly flu shot, the new COVID vaccine and for many Americans - one more shot.Every September, Priscilla Iturriaga of Palmdale and her five kids always get their flu shots."I don't ever remember getting the flu. None of my kids ever got it," she said.The flu has been kind to Iturriaga, but doctors say the shot doesn't prevent every little cough or runny nose. Its true goal is to keep you alive."It's to prevent the flu from causing pneumonia, to prevent the flu from going to the brain and causing encephalitis or going to the heart and causing myocarditis," Bronstein said.With the flu expected to hit early, Bronstein said get the flu shot now, especially kids 8 and younger who've never had one because they'll need two doses. People who are elderly should ask their pharmacists for the high dose vaccine."If that's not available in your area right now, wait a few weeks. That's okay. And get the high dose for everyone 65 and up," he said.Bronstein said it's perfectly fine to get a flu shot at the same time you get your COVID and RSV vaccine if you're eligible. The most important thing is not to skip it."Get it, I mean, protect yourself. You don't wanna get sick. You don't wanna end up in the hospital, " said Iturriaga.To protect the most vulnerable, doctors say everyone needs to get a flu shot.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

Print Flu season is just around the corner, and the time is fast approaching for residents to consider getting their annual vaccine. While the flu is often relatively mild, infection can carry dangerous — and even deadly — consequences for some. And that risk is one of the major reasons health officials encourage most everyone to roll up their sleeves and try and stymie the spread. Here’s a primer on flu shots, based on information shared by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Advertisement When is the best time to get a flu shot?September and October are ideal times to get the flu shot. But if you miss that window, it’s still helpful to get it later in the cold-and-flu season, even through January or later. California A ‘tripledemic’ of flu, RSV and COVID is feared in California A confluence of respiratory illnesses has some California officials warning of a possible triple threat that could strain healthcare systems.Nov. 4, 2022 What kind of flu shot should I get?Health officials suggest that those age 65 and older get either a higher-dose or “adjuvanted” flu shot. An adjuvant is an ingredient that helps create a stronger immune response. When it comes to the flu vaccine, there are three types that are recommended for older people, all with long, complicated names: HD-IIV4, or quadrivalent high-dose inactivated influenza vaccine; RIV4, or quadrivalent recombinant influenza vaccine; and aIIV4, or quadrivalent adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine. Advertisement But don’t sweat it if none of those are available. The CDC says any other age-appropriate flu shot is also acceptable. Who should get the flu shot?Everyone age 6 months and older, with rare exceptions.Can you get the flu shot and a COVID vaccine at the same time?Yes. Can you get the flu shot if you are sick with COVID-19?People who are at least moderately sick with COVID-19 should wait until they’re recovered before getting a flu shot. And for people who are mildly ill or have no symptoms, a person might want to wait “to avoid confusing illness symptoms with vaccine reactions,” the CDC said. Advertisement California With coronavirus uptick, should I get a COVID shot? When are new vaccines available? Updated versions and new vaccines for COVID-19, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus will be rolled out this fall.Aug. 11, 2023 If I’m going to travel, how soon should I get the flu shot for it to be fully effective on my trip?Ideally, get the flu shot two weeks before leaving for the trip. Is there an alternative to a flu shot?Yes, there’s a nasal spray flu vaccine, which can be given to healthy people between the ages of 2 and 49. The spray is not an option for those who are pregnant, however, or for people with weakened immune systems.Should pregnant people get the flu shot?Yes. Getting vaccinated for flu helps protect pregnant people from becoming seriously ill, while also helping protect the baby from infection for a number of months after birth. Can the flu shot give me the flu?No, it’s impossible for a flu shot to give you the flu. Flu shots are made using either killed flu viruses or don’t contain any virus at all. The nasal spray flu vaccine does contain weakened viruses, but they do not cause flu illness and are designed not to multiply in relatively warm places like the lungs. Why are flu shots needed every year?There are different kinds of flu, and the flu shot is reformulated annually to protect against the dominant versions expected to circulate each autumn and winter. Your immune protection from the flu, given through the flu shot, also weakens over time. Seasonal vaccines are designed to protect against both infection and illness. Studies indicate that getting vaccinated against the flu reduces the risk of illness by between 40% and 60%, the CDC says. One study, published in 2018, suggested that adults who got a flu shot reduced their risk of getting admitted into an intensive care unit by 82%. Advertisement California RSV season may have already begun, CDC warns, with early activity in the Southeast A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention health advisory notes elevated cases of respiratory syncytial virus in parts of the Southeastern U.S.Sept. 6, 2023 Why should I consider getting the shot?The flu is no mere cold. Generally, the flu is more severe and can cause an abrupt onset of symptoms — including fever, aches, chills, fatigue, weakness, chest discomfort, cough and headache — that are sometimes serious enough to require a hospital stay. Flu can also be associated with serious complications like bacterial infections.Recovering from flu can take days or even a couple of weeks, “but some people will develop complications (such as pneumonia) as a result of flu, some of which can be life-threatening,” the CDC says. Flu can also trigger inflammation of the heart, brain or muscle tissues. Over the decade that ended with the 2019–2020 season, an average of about 35,000 Americans died from the flu annually.Who is most at risk?People at highest risk from flu include people older than 65; those with chronic health conditions like asthma, diabetes, or heart disease; pregnant people; and children younger than 5, especially those younger than 2. But even young, relatively healthy people can fall seriously ill. And, officials note, they can unwittingly spread the flu to someone who is less equipped to fight off the infection. Science & Medicine FDA approves first vaccine for RSV after decades of attempts The U.S. has approved the first vaccine for human respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, to protect older adults.May 3, 2023 What other viruses should I be aware of?Flu presents a recurring, if somewhat predictable, healthcare challenge. But last year saw an unusual convergence — a ‘tripledemic’ when flu season arrived at the same time as an onslaught of respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV; as well as a resurgence of COVID-19. Advertisement Hospitals were quite strained last autumn and winter due to respiratory illnesses. Initial estimates suggest there were somewhere in the range of tens of thousands of flu deaths nationally, along with hundreds of thousands of flu hospitalizations. This year, protection against RSV for the first time is available in the form of vaccinations for people age 60 and older and monoclonal antibodies for babies and young children, which are recommended before a possible infection. Administration of those could help reduce the impact of RSV this year. Updated COVID-19 vaccines — formulated, like the flu shots, in hopes of providing protection against the dominant circulating strains — are also expected to be available, perhaps as soon as next week.

From: UK Health Security Agency Published 8 September 2023 The annual NHS flu vaccination programme for children aged 2 to 3 years, school age children and children over 6 months with certain health conditions is getting under way. Parents will receive invites from next week. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) and NHS England are calling on parents to make sure children’s consent forms are completed, and that eligible pre-schoolers are booked in for appointments at the GP practice, to help halt the spread of flu this autumn and winter. Over 8 million children in reception to year 11 will be offered the free nasal spray flu vaccine, delivered in schools by immunisation teams up and down the country. Children aged 2 and 3 years (on or before 31 August) are eligible for the free nasal spray via their GP practice. Children aged between 6 months and 2 years with a long-term health condition that makes them at higher risk from flu will be offered a flu vaccine injection instead of the nasal spray. This is because the nasal spray is not licensed for children aged under 2 years. Flu rebounded last winter after being kept low since March 2020 by COVID-19 control measures. UKHSA’s preliminary analysis found that deaths linked to flu last winter were the highest since the 2017 to 2018 season. Over 10,000 children were hospitalised last winter due to the infection. Vaccination effectiveness data from last year showed that the vaccines reduced the risk of hospitalisations by two-thirds. Flu vaccine is the best protection we have against an unpredictable virus. Flu can be a very unpleasant illness in children causing: fever extreme tiredness aching muscles and joints stuffy nose dry cough sore throat Complications of flu include painful inflammation inside the ear, and pneumonia that makes breathing difficult. Each winter thousands of children need to go to hospital for treatment, including intensive care, with children aged under 5 years having one of the highest rates of hospital admissions due to flu. By getting vaccinated, your child also protects others around them, including babies, grandparents and people with weak immune systems. Dr Conall Watson, Public Health Consultant and Lead Flu Epidemiologist at UKHSA, said: Flu can be more than just an unpleasant illness in children – for some an infection is life-threatening, including kids who are normally very active and healthy. Flu vaccines give vital protection – not just keeping kids well, but also out of hospital. Each winter thousands of children require treatment in hospital for flu or its complications. Many of these episodes could be prevented by a simple nasal spray. On top of helping to keep your child healthy, the flu vaccine also helps stop the spread of flu in the community – helping to protect those who are more vulnerable and the elderly such as grandparents. When you get the electronic or paper consent form from the NHS school immunisation team, please make sure you return it, so your child doesn’t miss their nasal spray vaccination session. If you have a pre-schooler aged 2 or 3 years on 31 August, you should make an appointment to get their nasal spray vaccination at the GP practice. NHS Director of Vaccinations and Screening, Steve Russell, said: With children recently returning to school, it is essential that they are vaccinated against flu as quickly as possible to protect themselves and their vulnerable loved ones. The fast and easy nasal spray has a proven record of protecting children who need it most, with the NHS offering it to the majority of children this year. I would encourage anyone with questions to come forward and speak to your GP or other healthcare professionals for advice. If your child has a medical condition that makes them more at risk from flu, such as asthma or cerebral palsy, you can get them vaccinated at the GP practice if you don’t want to wait for the school session. Children who can’t have the nasal spray for medical or faith reasons should have an injected flu vaccine instead, also provided free by the NHS. The nasal spray vaccine does not cause flu, because the viruses in it have been weakened to prevent this from happening, but the weakened viruses help each child to build up immunity. This means vaccinated children will be better able to fight off flu. The vaccine is absorbed very quickly in the nose so even if the child sneezes immediately after having had the spray, there’s no need to worry that it hasn’t worked. Side effects of the nasal spray are typically mild if present at all. Children may develop a runny or blocked nose, headache, general tiredness, and some loss of appetite. However, these are much milder than developing flu or complications of flu, and some of these will be due to common cold viruses circulating at the time the flu vaccine is given. Infections such as flu, RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), norovirus (the winter vomiting bug) and scarlet fever (caused by group A streptococcus) usually start to rise throughout autumn and winter. Keeping children off school when unwell is important to slowing the spread of many illnesses. If your child is unwell and has a fever, they should stay home from school or nursery until they feel better, and the fever has resolved. If your child has diarrhoea and/or vomits, they should stay off school or nursery for at least 48 hours after their symptoms clear up. It’s fine to send your child to school with a minor cough or common cold. However, if they have a fever, keep them off school until the fever goes. Professor Kamila Hawthorne, Chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners said: We are heading into a difficult winter for general practice and the NHS so it’s important that we’re all as prepared as possible. That’s why we welcome the start of the children’s flu vaccination programme and are encouraging parents to take up this important opportunity to protect their children. Getting your child vaccinated not only keeps them safe, but all your family members – particularly older grandparents and great-grandparents who may be vulnerable to the potentially dangerous complications of flu – and the wider population. We need to remember that influenza is a potentially life-threatening illness, and we must not let falling rates of vaccination become another hidden legacy of the pandemic. The widespread disruption in healthcare meant that many vaccination programmes for diseases other than COVID-19 lost momentum. This must be addressed, and we need to see a return to high rates of vaccination rates across the board. Having your child vaccinated against flu will help family doctors to protect their patients most effectively and ensure that NHS services are available for those who need them most over the coming months.

Photo / 123rfGP clinics have been seeing a “sustained” level of flu cases coming through the door throughout the season, with monitored rates of flu-like illnesses higher than this time last year. Photo / 123rfIf you’re surprised to have caught the flu this late in the year, you won’t be alone: this season appears to be much more of a slow-burner than the last one, a virologist says.GP clinics have been seeing a “sustained” level of flu cases coming through the door throughout the season, with monitored rates of flu-like illnesses higher than this time last year.“It’s been a slow-moving picture, all the way from April until now,” ESR’s Dr Sue Huang said.In a normal year, the flu infects around one in three Kiwis and kills perhaps 500 - making it hitherto our single deadliest infectious disease before Covid-19, which may claim twice that average flu toll in 2023.One dramatic feature of last year’s season was the biggest peak in cases observed in a decade - an unsurprising effect of a long-suppressed virus sweeping back with force.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.But this season, two different factors had stood out: its consistent activity and earlier kickoff.“We design our flu surveillance to go from May to September each year because we know that flu peaks around July and August,” Huang said.“Last year was a bit of a surprise as that peak happened earlier around June and July - but this year, flu activity started so early in April, which was really unusual.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.“I’ve been working on flu surveillance for the last 25 years, and I’ve never seen flu activity start so early.”Rather than having been a short-lived spike in flu cases, Huang said activity had been maintained throughout the whole winter period, although rates had been gradually dropping off.ESR data showed that, for the year to date, New Zealand’s current rate of cumulative influenza-associated hospitalisation stood at about 62.4 per 100,000.“It’s been a slow-moving picture, all the way from April until now,” ESR virologist Dr Sue Huang said of this year's flu season. Photo / NZMEThat was notably higher than last year’s rate of 47.4 per 100,000, although still cumulatively the fifth-biggest flu year since 2012.While overall activity was now tracking at or below 2015-19 levels, rates of severe acute respiratory illnesses had been tracking upwards in Auckland - and remained elevated among children aged zero to four years.“To have such a broad, long peak, all the way until now, is also quite unusual,” Huang said.She cited an obvious factor behind those patterns: the return of long-absent B and A(H1N1) “swine flu”, strains, which were known to hit children and the elderly hard respectively.Influenza B made up about 43 per cent of the strains ESR had typed this year, while influenza A(H1N1) accounted for around a third.“Because we’ve got these two viruses back circulating, and an immunity gap in our population, it means the season just drags on.”Anticipating another bumper flu season, the health system had moved to ease strain on hospitals by spreading resources, using telehealth services and helping patients to recover at home.AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.While GP clinics hadn’t been overwhelmed by flu cases this year, Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners’ medical director Dr Luke Bradford said there’d been a “sustained level” of the virus throughout the season.The Tauranga-based GP compared rates to pre-Covid activity and expected the coming school holidays would help dampen flu for the year.Meanwhile, flu wasn’t the only nasty that’d been in the mix this season.Of severe acute respiratory illnesses detected at “sentinel” hospitals, RSV made up about 20 per cent, while Covid-19-causing Sars-CoV-2 accounted for about 13 per cent.She urged people to follow those same principles of the pandemic.“If you’re not well, don’t go back to work, and keep social distance from people around you.”AdvertisementAdvertise with NZME.Jamie Morton is a specialist in science and environmental reporting.

While there is no declared outbreak, doctors are urging people to remain vigilant, especially as the rainy season is expected to intensify the spread of infections.Outpatient numbers at government-run hospitals has raised concerns, with an increase in cases reported at Gandhi Hospital over the past week, primarily attributed to flu-like illnesses and fever. Dr. Raja Rao, the Hospital Superintendent, reported a 300-400 case upswing in the hospital’s overall outpatient department (OP). Similarly, Fever Hospital has seen a surge, with a daily caseload of 400 outpatient cases. Dr. Shanker, the Hospital Superintendent, reassured the public that there is no cause for alarm.Among the viruses currently circulating in Hyderabad, Influenza (Flu) and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) are notable. Influenza, a common seasonal respiratory tract infection, is caused by highly contagious influenza viruses. RSV, on the other hand, infects airway linings, leading to cold-like symptoms such as sneezing, coughing, and nasal discharge.“The cold climate is expected to aid virus transmission, as lower temperatures favour the survival of these viruses. Unlike hot temperatures, which tend to stop micro-organism growth, cold conditions provide a conducive environment for viral spread,” said Pulmonologist Dr Rajeev Naik.Many cases are initially characterised by mild body pains, escalating to high-grade fever, often exceeding 103 degrees Fahrenheit. After 3-4 days of fever, some patients develop severe coughing, and a few progress to pneumonia. Notably, some patients are also testing positive for dengue, experiencing a drop in platelet counts. Dr. Saketa Reddy, a general physician based in Hyderabad, pointed out a recent rise in dengue cases over the past two to three weeks. While individuals with weakness and body pains tend to recover within a few days, Dr. Reddy advises monitoring symptoms for improvement within one to two days. If symptoms persist, consulting a health care provider for antibiotics or tailored treatment is recommended.“In comparison to the previous year, when infections surged like a Tsunami from around this time until February 2023, this year’s situation resembles pre-COVID years. The increased testing for throat and nose swabs has enabled better identification of circulating viruses. It is important to note that dengue cases appear to be less severe this year, but precautions against mosquito-borne diseases, especially for children, remain essential,” added Dr. Sivaranjani Santosh, Chief Paediatrician at Magna Centre. She emphasised the importance of parents being well-versed in first-aid for fever, seizures, vomiting, diarrhoea, cough, cold, and sore throat.As September brings auspicious festivities and Ganesh Chaturthi, doctors urge caution during public gatherings. “There is a need to establish a cultural norm of refraining from attending events while suffering from a fever, a practice not commonly observed in Indian families,” highlighted Dr. Madap Karuna, a paediatrician.

While in its first spell, low-grade fever, cough and body ache were the dominant symptoms, this time, most have been struck by high fever, severe body ache, muscle pain, nausea and general weakness. Representative image KOLKATA: The "seven-day fever" has made a comeback after a brief lull in the spate of viral infections, with severe symptoms often overlapping with dengue. While in its first spell, low-grade fever, cough and body ache were the dominant symptoms, this time, most have been struck by high fever, severe body ache, muscle pain, nausea and general weakness.The recovery period, too, has stretched to a week, making doctors refer to it as the 'seven-day fever' which, they said, strikes Kolkata every three-four years.A section of patients have also been suffering from dual infection or a simultaneous attack of two viruses, leading to a severe disease. A few have also been struck by two different viruses one after another.With dengue cases rising, doctors advise a blood test in case fever and weakness last more than three days.This is the classical seven-day fever, according to RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) intensivist Sauren Panja. "Viruses, like enterovirus, rotavirus, various strains of influenza and, in a few cases, retrovirus, are triggering this bout of fever accompanied by intense body ache that is turning out to be debilitating. Nausea and a loss of appetite are the other common symptoms. We have received a few cases of dual infection, mostly a simultaneous attack of an influenza strain and entero or rotavirus. This has turned the symptoms extremely severe. Those suffering sequential infections are taking almost two weeks to recover. With fever persisting for 12-14 days, patients are left weak and unable to move freely," said Panja.At Peerless Hospital, there has been a surge in viral infection cases both at its outdoor department and in the number of admissions. Till a fortnight ago, the hospital had been receiving patients with a range of viral infections, like influenza A and B, adenovirus, rhinovirus and swine flu. That was overtaken by dengue cases. "Now, we are seeing a resurgence of viral infections with symptoms that are more intense than the first spell. High-grade fever and severe muscle pain are dominant now. With dengue spreading fast as well, symptoms are similar and it has become difficult to distinguish one from another," said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra.He added that despite tests, most cases have remained undetected. "While a few have tested positive for swine flu, the rest have neither dengue nor another common virus. We don't test everyone though, and dengue cases are rising sharply. So, the elderly and those with comorbidities are often preferring hospitalization," said Mitra.Treatment has to be strictly symptomatic, said Panja. "Paracetamol for fever remission and anti-viral drugs for some influenza strains are prescribed. Comorbid patients need to be screened and steps have to be taken according to severity of symptoms," he added.More severe and complicated cases of viral infection that led to prolonged hospitalization have been those followed by a secondary bacterial infection, said doctors. "Those with existing lung conditions, like COPD or asthma, have been more vulnerable to secondary infection. It has been leading to breathing distress and hospitalization. Several of my patients, mostly elderly, were severely affected by influenza, which tends to trigger lung disorders even without a secondary infection. But swine flu hasn't been severe this time," said internal medicine consultant Arindam Biswas.
