It can be republished for free. Mike Huckabee, a former Fox News host who was also a Republican presidential candidate and governor of Arkansas, similarly claimed on Facebook that the CDC test cannot tell the difference between coronaviruses and flu viruses. A July 24 Instagram post went further: “The FDA announced today that the CDC PCR test has failed its full review. Emergency Use Authorization has been REVOKED.” The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its news feed.

We wanted to know whether there was any truth to the idea that the CDC was removing its test because it is faulty and cannot tell one virus from another. So we consulted several laboratory testing experts. Email Sign-Up Subscribe to KFF Health News' free Morning Briefing. Your Email Address Sign Up The Real Reason for Withdrawing the EUA Request The first Facebook post we referenced quoted from and linked to a July 21 CDC laboratory alert that informed labs that as of Dec. 31 the agency would withdraw its emergency use authorization request for the CDC 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR Diagnostic Panel or, for short, the CDC 2019-nCoV RT-PCR. It is standard practice for the Food and Drug Administration to issue temporary emergency use authorizations for tests and other medical products that have not yet undergone the FDA’s full approval process but need to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat or prevent serious diseases. The FDA issued the EUA for the CDC’s 2019-nCoV RT-PCR in February 2020. At that time, no other tests were available in the U.S. to determine whether someone had covid. But it’s important to remember that what the CDC developed and submitted for its EUA request was not a tangible product but rather a protocol for how to test for covid, said Susan Whittier, a professor of pathology and cell biology at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. That means the CDC wrote out directions specifying which reagents were needed to test the laboratory samples for the presence of the covid virus. The CDC does not distribute covid tests. “It’s not like they have a test that laboratories can purchase. We borrow their protocol and use the reagents that they say,” said Whittier, who recently retired as director of the clinical microbiology lab at Columbia. So withdrawing the EUA request just “means that protocol will no longer be available.” In the lab alert, the CDC said it was withdrawing the EUA request because, rather than testing only for the covid virus, it wants labs to test people for multiple viruses simultaneously, using what is known as a “multiplexed method.” The CDC’s 2019-nCoV RT-PCR panel tests only for the covid virus. “Such assays can facilitate continued testing for both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 and can save both time and resources as we head into influenza season,” noted the alert regarding the multiplexed method. Dr. Christopher Polage, an associate professor of pathology at Duke University, said his take on the CDC’s message is that, because flu season is on the horizon, a patient might come in with respiratory symptoms that could be attributed to either covid or the flu. Laboratories need to start testing for both covid and various flu viruses. But the lab alert does not mean the CDC’s test cannot differentiate between covid and the flu. In fact, the CDC’s 2019-nCoV RT-PCR test was developed to look for the presence of a nucleic acid found only in the covid virus, said Kelly Wroblewski, director of infectious disease programs at the Association of Public Health Laboratories. “It is not remotely accurate that the CDC test doesn’t differentiate between flu and SARS-CoV-2. It doesn’t detect influenza. It only detects SARS-CoV-2,” said Wroblewski. “If flu and covid are both circulating, you would be able to detect only SARS-CoV-2 and not flu.” How the CDC’s 2019-nCoV RT-PCR test (or any other PCR test) works, Wroblewski said, is that primers, which are little bits of a genetic material, are used to identify specific viruses. In this case, the primer is built to identify a nucleic acid found only in the covid virus. If the covid virus is present in the sample, the primer will attach to the virus’s nucleic acid and make many copies of it. A chemical in the test will then fluoresce, which the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, machine will interpret as a positive result. If the covid virus is not present, the primer will have nothing to attach to. When asked about the CDC withdrawing its EUA request, FDA spokesperson Jim McKinney told us PCR tests are considered the “gold standard” for covid diagnosis. He pointed us to data that illustrated the specificity and exclusivity of the CDC’s test. That data shows test results came back negative for samples that contained similar viruses, including different types of flu and other coronaviruses. All of this means the CDC’s 2019-nCoV RT-PCR test would not erroneously detect flu viruses. Thus, the Facebook posts’ assertions that the test cannot differentiate between covid and flu are demonstrably false. Even though the CDC is withdrawing its EUA request for this specific test, Wroblewski pointed out, it still has an EUA for a second PCR test, a multiplex one that simultaneously tests for covid and influenza types A and B. The FDA has issued EUAs to many laboratories and testing companies for hundreds of covid tests that use the same PCR technology the CDC uses — which experts said essentially made the CDC testing protocol moot, since similar tests will still be available. So, while it is true the CDC is withdrawing its EUA request for its test that tests solely for covid, it is not for the reasons given by the Facebook posts. The assertion that covid case counts were inflated because the test was faulty and was counting flu cases as covid cases is false. “They didn’t withdraw the EUA because the test wasn’t working,” said Whittier. “They just wanted people to look for other viruses as well.” Polage agreed. “The CDC is pulling their test ‘off the market’ as a gesture to encourage labs to use tests that include reagents (primers and probes) for both SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza so providers, labs, states, and CDC will have better data this fall and winter to estimate how much of clinical influenza-like illness is due to SARS-CoV-2 and how much is due to seasonal influenza,” Polage said in an email. Our Ruling Social media posts claimed the CDC was revoking its emergency use authorization request for its covid test because it couldn’t differentiate between the covid virus and flu viruses. While the CDC is withdrawing its EUA request for the 2019-nCoV RT-PCR test, it is not because the test is faulty. Rather, it’s because the agency is concerned that, with flu season approaching, patients with respiratory illness symptoms should be screened for both the flu and covid. The patients shouldn’t be tested for covid alone, because flu cases might be missed. The statements made in these Facebook posts are not accurate. We rate this claim False.

(RMIT ABC Fact Check)abc.net.auews/coronacheck-pcr-tests-cdc-covid-flu/100334096Link copiedShareShare articleCoronaCheck is RMIT ABC Fact Check's weekly email newsletter dedicated to fighting the misinformation infodemic surrounding the coronavirus outbreak.You can read the latest edition below, and subscribe to have the next newsletter delivered straight to your inbox.CoronaCheck #76In this week's CoronaCheck, we debunk viral misinformation about the PCR tests used to identify COVID-19 cases, which ramped up after a Victorian news conference.We also examine Prime Minister Scott Morrison's claim that his "it's not a race" comments were not made in relation to the pace of Australia's vaccine rollout, and look at how a news conference slip-up led to a rush of misinformation about COVID-19 hospitalisations in the current NSW outbreak.News conference question gives new life to PCR test misinformationAs Victorian authorities announced an easing of lockdown restrictions on Tuesday, the state's Chief Health Officer, Brett Sutton, was questioned by a journalist about the accuracy of PCR tests used to identify COVID-19 cases."The US [Centers for Disease Control] has found that PCR tests can't distinguish between the flu and COVID," Professor Sutton was asked. "Are we looking at that? Are we concerned about that?"Loading YouTube contentIn response, Professor Sutton explained that it wasn't "really an issue"."If someone tests positive, [the test] will go through a quality assurance process to make sure that it's absolutely and unequivocally a positive test," he said."I've heard nothing from our reference laboratories that our PCR tests do anything other than pick up, with enormous sensitivity, the COVID virus."By Tuesday afternoon, the question, and Professor Sutton's response, had prompted an onslaught of misinformation.Reignite Democracy Australia, a popular anti-mask, anti-lockdown and COVID-19 conspiracy group with more than 65,000 Facebook followers, shared an image of Brett Sutton captioned: "PCR tests can't distinguish between the flu and COVID. Brett Sutton doesn't think that's a problem."A similarly captioned video of the news conference was also shared online and viewed by Fact Check on four separate social media platforms.Both the original question — and subsequent social media misinformation — appear to be based on a misunderstanding of an official CDC document.According to a July 21 "lab alert" directed at groups performing COVID-19 testing, the CDC had announced that it would be withdrawing its request to the US Food and Drug Administration for an Emergency Use Authorisation of the "CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel". Experts say PCR tests are capable of discerning the SARS-CoV-2 virus from other viruses, including other coronaviruses.(Reuters: Francois Lenoir)The alert suggested that labs begin using tests which "can facilitate detection and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses".However, the alert has been wrongly interpreted by many as an "admission" that all COVID-19 tests fail to distinguish between COVID-19 and the flu."Is this an admission that the COVID-19 tests used in Australia can't tell the difference between COVID-19 and influenza? Or that they are the same thing? Or the tests just don't work at all? Maybe all of the above," one widely shared Facebook post of an Australian law firm reads.But as Stevie Zhang, a research reporter at First Draft, explained on Twitter, the CDC announcement did not mean that PCR tests were unable to differentiate between COVID-19 and the flu.Loading Twitter content"As the US heads into flu season, they want to save time and resources by using a test that can detect multiple viruses," Zhang said. "Currently the PCR nose swab *only* tests for COVID-19 and nothing else."A CDC spokeswoman quoted by FactCheck.org echoed this reasoning, explaining that the alert applied only to the PCR test developed early in the pandemic to test explicitly for COVID-19."The demand for this test has declined with the emergence of other higher-throughput and multiplexed assays," she said, adding that the CDC was encouraging labs to use more nuanced tests.Meanwhile, in Australia, Nobel prize-winning immunologist Peter Doherty tweeted in relation to the reporter's question to Professor Sutton: "The COVID-19 PCR test discriminates SARS-CoV-2 from any other virus, including all human CoVs."Catch up on the latest COVID-19 news hereWere Scott Morrison's 'it's not a race' comments taken out of context?Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been accused of "trying to reinvent history" during a media blitz in defence of Australia's much-criticised vaccine rollout.Appearing on both ABC Radio Adelaide and FIVEaa, Mr Morrison declared that his repeated reference to the vaccine rollout as being "not a race" had been taken out of context."It's unfortunate that the comments Professor [Brendan] Murphy and I made have been used in the way they have. We were talking about how cautious we needed to be when it came to the approval of vaccines for use in Australia," he told ABC Radio Adelaide."But I know how politics works and I know how people use things out of context and about what you say."He continued his defence in an interview with Channel Seven's Sunrise program yesterday. "[W]e were talking about the regulation of the vaccines. I'm not sure people are aware of that."Loading Twitter contentIn February, the Prime Minister defended the Therapeutic Goods Administration against accusations of a slow approval process for the AstraZeneca vaccine compared to other countries, stating the regulator's approach was timely and did not cut corners.However, an examination of Mr Morrison's comments since then shows the Prime Minister's use of the phrase "not a race" was in response to criticism of the sluggish rollout long after the vaccines had been approved.The TGA approved the Pfizer vaccine for use on January 25. The regulator approved the AstraZeneca jab on February 16.During a March 11 news conference, Mr Morrison said the government was working towards having Australians fully vaccinated by October."It's not a race. It's not a competition for the sake of people's health — you get it right. And that's exactly what we're doing and, where we are, our October deadline is the one we're absolutely working to — there's no change to that," he said.The Prime Minister also appeared in television interviews on Today and Sunrise on March 11 and reiterated that the rollout was not a race and was on track to be completed by October.Loading Twitter contentSimilarly, at other media conferences throughout March, Mr Morrison told reporters the rollout was keeping pace, while doubling down on his claim that the country was not in a race."It's important for all states and territories to be on pace with this. It's not a race; it's not a competition," he said in response to questions about the delay to Phase 1A of the vaccine program.More recently, during parliamentary question time on June 3, the Prime Minister said he stood by his remarks and claimed his comments on a vaccine race were echoing similar statements made at the time by Professor Murphy, the secretary of the Department of Health.However, Professor Murphy's comments about Australia not being in a race were also made in reference to the speed of the vaccine rollout."This is not a race. We have no burning platform in Australia," he said during a joint news conference with Mr Morrison on March 10."We are taking it as quickly and carefully and safely as we can. We're not like the US or the UK or most other countries in the world where they've got people in hospital dying. We can take our time, set up our systems, do it safely and carefully, we are expanding our rollout every day."The Prime Minister's office did not respond to questions.Misinformation spreads after NSW health official's gaffeA video showing the director of health protection at NSW Health, Jeremy McAnulty, announcing "all but one" of more than 40 COVID-19 patients in intensive care had been vaccinated has been shared widely online. Dr McAnulty misspoke at the press conference, but later corrected himself.(AAP Image: Joel Carrett)In the video, which was taken from the state's daily COVID-19 news conference last Sunday, Dr McAnulty says that of the 43 people in intensive care "all but one are vaccinated; one person has just received one dose of vaccine".What the video fails to capture, however, is Dr McAnulty later adding that he had misspoken and correcting the record."Of the 43 people in intensive care units, 42 have not been vaccinated [and] one person had just one dose of vaccine," he clarified.Online, the video has been shared among anti-vaccination communities in order to cast doubt on the effectiveness and safety of COVID-19 vaccines, with some going as far to suggest a government conspiracy."You are being lied to and gaslit 24/7," one Twitter user wrote alongside the clip of Dr McAnulty's gaffe."This is proof. Buried under a mountain of terrifying ‘statistics' is the only one that matters. ALL of these very sick people ARE VAXXED. Vaxxed getting MORE sick than unvaxxed. Give your head a shake!"Among those who shared the clip was social media influencer Taylor Winterstein. Known online as 'Tay's Way', Ms Winterstein has 73,000 Instagram followers and came under fire from the Australian Medical Association in 2019 for her views on vaccination.Former Australian senator Cory Bernardi also posted on Twitter a link to the video on web-sharing platform Rumble, which has come under criticism for aiding in the spread of misinformation.While both Mr Bernardi and Ms Winterstein later conceded that Dr McAnulty had corrected the record, Mr Bernardi's original post remains live and Ms Winterstein has alleged that the correction constituted "backpedalling" and a "cover-up" by the NSW government.From Washington, D.C.Joe Biden last week took part in his second town hall appearance as US President, fielding questions from both a CNN reporter and citizens of Cincinnati, where the event was held. Fact checkers ran the rule over a number of Mr Biden's claims at the town hall.(Reuters: Jonathan Ernst)Fact checkers at both CNN Facts First and the Washington Post Fact Checker kept an eye on the proceedings.According to the Post, President Biden's claim that "you're not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations" was not accurate, as some people who are inoculated against COVID-19 can still be infected in so-called "breakthrough cases"."Doctors say the symptoms are generally milder for breakthrough cases of COVID-19, because the body's acquired immunity is still able to tamp down the worst of the disease," the fact checkers added.They noted, however, that Mr Biden later made a more accurate claim about vaccine effectiveness when he said that of 10,000 people who had recently died from COVID-19, 9,950 of them were unvaccinated.The Post also found that on multiple measures it was incorrect for Mr Biden to claim that the cost of a car in the US was "kind of back to what it was before the pandemic"."The consumer price index for new and used cars in US cities was 20 per cent higher last month compared with February 2020, the last month before the US economy went into a pandemic-induced recession for three months," they explained."Measuring from June 2019 to June 2021, the increase in car prices is also 20 per cent."CNN, meanwhile, took aim at Mr Biden's suggestion that either 600,000 or 6 million people (he admitted he needed to "check the number") were affected by non-compete agreements that restrict workers' abilities to leave their jobs for work at other companies.In reality, the number is far higher: between 30 million and 60 million people, according to official White House estimates.In other news: Has the cost of visiting the doctor gone up 30 per cent under the Coalition?With a federal election on the horizon, Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese has attacked the Coalition's record on Medicare funding, claiming in a tweet that "it costs 34 per cent more to see your doctor today than it did when the Liberals came to power".Fact Check this week found that claim to be misleading.Fact check: Cost of seeing your doctorOpposition Leader Anthony Albanese says it costs 34 per cent more to see the doctor today than when the Coalition came to power. RMIT ABC Fact Check investigates.Read moreIn more than seven years of Coalition government, the average out-of-pocket cost for GP visits for those patients who are charged fees increased by 38 per cent.However, more than 66 per cent of patients pay nothing at all to visit their GP, according to Department of Health data from 2018-19.Bulk-billed services, or those that cost patients nothing, account for the vast majority of GP services, with bulk-billing rates increasing under the Coalition, as Fact Check recently explained.Critically, experts consulted by Fact Check said increases in out-of-pocket costs could not be attributed to any one government, with these having trended higher since at least the early 1990s.Moreover, Mr Albanese's focus on a simple percentage change does not account for how long the Coalition has been in power.In annual terms, the cost to visit a GP grew by an average of 4.3 per cent under the Coalition. That compares with 8.9 per cent annually under the last Labor government.And while for much of the Coalition's time in office rebates for GP visits were "frozen" at 2015 levels, experts told Fact Check there was limited evidence at the national level to show that this freeze had led to higher out-of-pocket costs for patients.Edited by Ellen McCutchan, with thanks to Ellen Blake, Eiddwen Jeffery and Jude EllisonGot a fact that needs checking?
