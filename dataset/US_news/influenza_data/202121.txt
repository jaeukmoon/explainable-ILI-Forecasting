In this study, we aimed to identify swIAV subtypes that circulated in pigs in Belgium and the Netherlands between 2014 and 2019, and characterize their genetic and antigenic evolution. We subtyped all isolates and analyzed hemagglutinin sequences and hemagglutination inhibition assay data for H1 swIAV, which were the dominant HA subtype. We also analyzed whole genome sequences (WGS) of selected isolates. Out of 200 samples, 89 tested positive for swIAV. swIAV of H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2 subtypes were detected. Analysis of WGS of 18 H1 swIAV isolates revealed three newly emerged genotypes. The European avian-like H1 swIAV (lineage 1C) were predominant and accounted for 47.2% of the total isolates. They were shown to evolve faster than the European human-like H1 (1B lineage) swIAV, which represented 27% of the isolates. The 2009 pandemic H1 swIAV (lineage 1A) accounted for only 5.6% of the isolates and showed divergence from their precursor virus. These results point to the increasing divergence of swIAV and stress the need for continuous surveillance of swIAV.

Due to the geographical segregation of pig populations and multiple introductions of viruses from either humans or birds, swine influenza A viruses (swIAV) differ genetically and antigenically between continents and regions. The surface proteins of influenza viruses, the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), frequently undergo minor amino acid changes, or antigenic drift, resulting in the emergence of new variants1. Also, due to their segmented genomes, influenza viruses are capable of exchanging genome segments by genetic reassortment, a process that results in new virus strains. As a result, multiple lineages of swIAV circulate globally. Four major lineages of swIAV with HA genes from distinct origins are enzootic in swine in Europe. Avian H1N1 viruses were introduced to swine in 1979. They are thus referred to as ‘avian-like’ H1N1 viruses2,3 and their HA genes belong to lineage 1C in the global H1 classification system4. H3N2 viruses emerged in 1984 after a reassortment between a human H3N2 virus related to A/Port Chalmers/1/1973 and the ‘avian-like’ swine H1N1 virus. This resulted in a ‘human-like’ H3N2 virus with internal genes from the ‘avian-like' H1N1 virus5,6,7. H1N2 viruses were first reported in 1994 and were reassortants with the HA gene of a human seasonal H1N1 virus that was circulating in the mid-1980s and all other genes from the human-like swine H3N2 virus. They are thus referred to as the ‘human-like’ H1N2 viruses8 and their HA belongs to lineage 1B4. The 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses belong to the latest of the four major swIAV lineages in the European swine population. They are reassortants comprising of gene segments from three major swIAV lineages9,10. The HA segment was derived from the classical swine H1N1 lineage, which has been present in North American swine since 1918, and belongs to lineage 1A4. The neuraminidase (NA) and matrix (M) genes were derived from the European ‘avian-like’ H1N1 virus, whereas the five remaining internal gene segments originated from a North American triple reassortant H3N2 swIAV.Swine influenza A viruses that circulate in Europe are genetically and antigenically distinct from those circulating in other continents due to introductions from different origins and time points. In North America, five major lineages of swIAV circulate in pigs. The first lineage is the classical swine (lineage 1A) whose emergence coincided with the 1918 human pandemic that was caused by an H1N1 virus11,12. The second lineage emerged only in the late 1990s and consists of “triple” reassortant H3N2 viruses with surface proteins from a human H3N2 virus and internal protein genes from the latter virus, as well as classical swine and avian viruses. The classical swine lineage viruses reassorted with this H3N2 virus, leading to the diversification of their HA. This led to the emergence of the α, β, and γ clades within the classical swine H1 lineage. In the early 2000s, viruses containing HA and/or NA derived from human seasonal H1N1 influenza viruses were introduced to pigs resulting in the third lineage of swIAV. Two clades emerged from this human seasonal-like H1 (lineage 1B) swIAV, the δ1 and δ2 clades13. The 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses formed the fourth lineage of swIAV11,12. The fifth lineage of swIAV emerged between 2010 and 2011 and it consists of viruses that acquired only the HA or both HA and NA from human H3N2 viruses that were circulating during this period. These are the so-called novel reassortant H3N2 viruses14. Currently, the predominant clades of H1 viruses in North America are the γ and δ1 clade viruses, which belong to lineages 1A and 1B respectively4,15. The situation is more complex in Asia, with lineages of swIAV circulating in Europe and North America also circulating in this continent16,17.The four European lineages of swIAV have continued to evolve, either through further reassortment events or accumulation of mutations in their surface protein genes, resulting in the emergence of multiple genotypes and clades of influenza viruses. This prompted the formation of the then “European Surveillance Networks for Influenza in Pigs” (ESNIP 1, 2 and 3) between 2001 and 201318,19,20,21. Between 2009 and 2013, 23 genotypes of swIAV were identified and 6 of them were responsible for 77% of the reported cases in 14 countries. A more recent surveillance study in 17 European countries from 2015–201822 identified 16 more genotypes that had not been reported prior to the study. Notably, the 2009 pandemic H1N1 viruses were not detected in Belgium and the Netherlands, but reassortants containing their genes (HA and internal genes) were detected in the Netherlands20,21,22. The introduction of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus into the swine population has resulted in increased reassortment, leading to an explosion of novel genotypes of swIAV13,23,24,25.There has been inconsistent surveillance of swIAV in swine populations worldwide, with uneven regional performance. Europe in particular, lags behind when compared to the USA. This could also be indicated partly by the differences in the amount of data from these two regions that are deposited in public sequence databases. In this study we aimed to: (1) Identify the subtypes and lineages of swIAV that circulated in swine in Belgium and the Netherlands from 2014 through 2019, (2) Determine the genotypes of the circulating viruses and explore possible introductions of genes from another continent, and (3) Genetically and antigenically characterize the predominant H1 swIAV subtype to better understand their evolutionary dynamics.Materials and methodsVirus isolation and subtypingViruses were isolated from nasal swabs or lung tissues collected from pigs with influenza-like symptoms in Belgium and the Netherlands between 2014 and 2019. Virus isolation was done in Mardin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells according to standard procedures26. Upon a first passage in MDCK cells, viral RNA was extracted using the INDICAL BIOSCIENCE IndiSpin pathogen kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and subtyped by multiplex RT-qPCR as previously described27.Whole genome sequencingExtracted RNA was amplified using Invitrogen Superscript III One-Step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) and influenza-specific primers28 designed to bind to the conserved 3’ and 5’ ends of all segments. PCR products were purified using AMPure XP Magnetic Beads (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, USA) and quantified with the NanoDrop™ 1000 Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). The Rapid Barcoding Kit (RBK-004, Oxford Nanopore Technology, Oxford, UK) was used to prepare libraries for the MinION platform as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were loaded onto a FLO-MIN106 R9.4.1 flow cell as per the manufacturer’s instructions and a five-hour run was conducted with standard settings. The MinIT (MinKNOW v19.12.1) was used to perform real time basecalling, and integrated Guppy v3.2.9 (ONT) was used to produce FastQ files. Mapping and final consensus production of the quality checked and trimmed reads was conducted in the Geneious Software Suite (v11.1.5; Biomatters) with Bowtie2 (v2.3.0 in the pre-set “Medium Sensitivity”), creating full genomes for all samples. Genotyping of the internal gene cassette was performed as previously described22.Genetic and antigenic characterization of the field isolatesWe selected a total of 16 H1 swine and human influenza A viruses to use as reference viruses in the genetic and antigenic HA characterization of the isolates (Table 1). The viruses were selected to include historical and contemporary influenza strains that circulated in pigs in Europe and North America, as well as in humans. The European swIAV were selected to represent the European H1 avian-like (EU H1av; 1C) and the European H1 human-like (EU H1hu; 1B.1) lineages with emphasis on the past (1982–1994) and more recent (1998–2012) strains. The North American swIAV on the other hand were selected to represent clades that currently circulate in swine, known by their colloquial names as H1-γ (1A.3.3.3) and H1-δ1 (1B.2.2) clade viruses, which in this study are referred to as US H1-γ and US H1-δ1 clade viruses respectively. We also selected three human seasonal H1N1 viruses spanning 20 years of antigenic drift and two viruses representative of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (H1pdm09) virus (1A.3.3.2).Table 1 Reference influenza A virus strains used for genetic and antigenic characterization of the hemagglutinin (HA) of swIAV isolates.Full size tableGenetic characterization of the HA of swIAV isolatesFull-length HA sequencing of virus isolates was partly performed at the Institute of Diagnostic Virology, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI), Germany and partly at the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), United Kingdom. The sequences were obtained by RT-qPCR as previously described29. QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used to purify amplicons generated from a 1.5% agarose gel. The amplicons were then Sanger-sequenced using the RT-PCR primers. Analysis of the sequences was performed on an ABI 310 sequencer. The sequences were then curated using the Chromas Lite@ software http://www.technelysium.com.au/Chromas250Setup.exe) and assembled using CAP3 programme (http://doua.prabi.fr/software/cap3)27. The HA of the isolates were assigned to clades using the tool4 on the Influenza Research Database (IRD) at http://fludb.org. The H1 numbering scheme described by Burke and Smith was used30 To determine the genetic relationships between the virus isolates and the reference viruses, sequences were aligned with ClustalW and percentage amino acid (aa) identities in the HA1 and at antigenic sites31,32 determined using MEGA 7.0.26 software33.All generated sequences were deposited in GenBank and assigned accession numbers MW362568-MW362741.For phylogenetic analysis, maximum-likelihood trees were constructed with the IQ-TREE web server34. HA1 amino acid sequences from clades 1A, 1B and 1C of H1 influenza A viruses were aligned using the MAFFT web bioinformatics framework (https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/)35. The constructed tree was presented and edited with FigTree V1.4.4 software (v1.4.4). The default Blosum62 substitution model was selected for the estimation of the amino acid substitution rates for both clade 1B and 1C viruses. Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach for Bayesian phylogenetic inference were performed with the BEAST package (version 1.10.4) using the strict molecular clock model. The model was run for more than 3,000,000 generations with every 2,000 cycles sampled for both clades. The fitting clock-rate and virus population evolutionary rate for the two clades of swIAV were analyzed with Tracer1.6 software (version 1.7.1). Effective sampling size (ESS > 200) of each run was obtained.Antigenic characterization of the HA of swIAV isolatesFor antigenic characterization, virus isolates passaged twice on MDCK cells were tested for cross-reactivity with hyperimmune swine or ferret sera against the selected reference viruses (Table 1) in hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays, according to standard procedures26. Briefly, sera were heat inactivated and then treated with receptor destroying enzyme (RDE) at 37 °C for 18 h to remove non-specific inhibitors. Non-specific agglutinins were removed prior to HI assay by adding 50% turkey red blood cells (TRBC). Tests were performed with two-fold serial dilutions of the sera, followed by incubation with 4 hemagglutinating units of virus for 1 h. TRBC at a concentration of 0.5% were added to the wells and incubated with the virus-serum mixtures for another 1 h. The reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum that completely inhibited hemagglutination was defined as the HI titer.Using the HI data, a 3 dimensional (3D) antigenic map was constructed using the antigenic cartography software (https://acmacs-web.antigenic-cartography.org/). Antigenic distances were generated as raw data directly from the antigenic cartography software. The 3D cartographic projections were generated using ACMAS. Analysis of the table vs map distance was then conducted. Antigenic distances are measured in antigenic units (AU) and 1 AU is equivalent to a two-fold dilution in the HI assay.The hyperimmune sera used in this study were produced against the selected reference viruses described and listed in Table 1. Different methods of production as well as different animal species (pigs and ferrets) were used. Antisera against the European H1 swIAV were produced in swine. For these, one influenza naïve pig per virus received two intramuscular vaccinations with ultra-violet light-inactivated monovalent whole virus vaccine (WIV) containing 256 hemagglutinating units (HAU) of virus in combination with an oil-in-water adjuvant (20% Emulsigen). The vaccines were administered 4-weeks apart. Blood was collected at the time of each vaccination and two weeks after the second vaccination, when a titer ≥ 160 was likely to have been achieved. Pigs were then humanely euthanised with sodium pentobarbital and large volumes of blood collected for serum. Antisera against the US H1γ and H1δ clade swIAV were generously provided by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). These were post-vaccination antisera that were produced in swine as described by Lewis et al.36. Antisera against the human viruses were generously provided by Dr. John McCauley of the Francis Crick Institute in London, United Kingdom. These were post-infection ferret sera.The samples used in this study were obtained from pig holdings for routine veterinary diagnosis on respiratory diseases. Examination and reporting followed the standard business guidelines of Ghent University. No additional sampling was instigated on the basis of this study. Therefore, a separate ethical approval was not required.ResultsSubtyping of swIAV isolatesOut of the 200 samples that we received over the 6-year period, 89 tested positive for swIAV by virus isolation in MDCK cells (Table 2). Seventeen of these viruses were isolated from pigs in the Netherlands while the other 72 originated from pigs in Belgium. In total, there were 71 H1 and 18 H3 swIAV isolates. Based on subtyping results, viruses with the EU H1av HA accounted for 47.2% of the total positive isolates while those with the EU H1hu and H3 HA accounted for 27.0 and 20.2%, respectively. Viruses with the H1pdm09 HA accounted for only 5.6% of the total isolates. The most dominant subtype was H1N1 (40 out of 89 isolates) from the EU H1av lineage, followed by H1N2 (24 out of 89 isolates) from the EU H1hu lineage and H3N2 (18 out of 89 isolates) respectively. Only one isolate belonged to the 2009 pandemic H1N1 subtype. Six isolates were reassortants between the above-mentioned subtypes. Two of these were H1avN2, three were H1pdmN2 and one H1pdmN1 virus but with the NA derived from the EU H1av lineage. We could not identify two isolates by RT-qPCR due to insufficient RNA material. Based on cross-HI data (Supplementary Table S2 online) and neuraminidase inhibition (NI) assay (Supplementary Table S6 online), they were characterized as H1huN2 (A/swine/Gent/175/2014) and H3N2 (A/swine/Gent/34/2014). H3 isolates were not further analyzed in this study.Table 2 Subtypes of swIAV isolated from pigs in Belgium and the Netherlands in the period 2014–2019.Full size tableGenotypic analysisIn total, 19 out of the 71 positive H1 isolates were selected for WGS. These included reassortant isolates as well as isolates that had a low signal in RT-qPCR. The isolates were selected for WGS on basis of subtype, date and location of origin so as to represent the full temporal, geographical and viral scope of the field sample collection. One sample, A/swine/Gent/55/2014, had low-coverage sequencing data and was therefore omitted from the analysis. Figure 1 shows genotypes of 18 H1 swIAV. As for the HA, these isolates belonged to different clades within the three H1 lineages: EU H1av (clade 1C.2.1 and 1C.2.2), EU H1hu (clade 1B.1.2.1) and H1pdm09 (clade 1A.3.3.2). Isolates of the H1N2 subtype had their NA derived from the prototype EU H1hu virus A/swine/Scotland/410,440/1994 (swSC94-like N2), or from the human-like H3N2 virus A/swine/Gent/1/1984 (swG84-like N2) as previously described21. Three out of the 18 sequenced isolates had genotypes (shown with red asterisk) that were not reported during the 2009–2013 influenza surveillance in Europe (Watson et al., 2015) and in the most recent surveillance study in Europe22. Interestingly, all the EU H1av and the EU H1hu viruses retained the internal genes of avian origin except for the M gene which, in 17 out of 18 viruses, was of H1pdm09 origin. The H1pdm09 viruses seem to have been circulating in pigs over the 6-year period although the first isolation of a wholly H1pdm09 virus in Belgium was in 2019.Figure 1Genotypes of 18 H1N1 and H1N2 swIAV isolated in Belgium and the Netherlands between 2014 and 2019. The colour coding assigned to gene segments is based on their origin: green rectangle European avian-like H1N1, magenta rectangle European human-like H1N2, dark blue rectangle 2009 pandemic H1N1, light blue rectangle human-like H3N2. The N2 of the isolates originated either from the European human-like H1N2 lineage (swSC94-like; purple rectangle) or from the European human-like H3N2 lineage (swG84-like; light blue rectangle)21. The three viruses with new genotypes are shown with asterisks (*).Full size imageGenetic characterization of the HA of swIAV isolatesDue to sequencing failures (partial sequences), the HA sequences of three viruses (A/swine/Gent/55/2014, A/swine/Gent/93/2014, A/swine/Gent/175/2014) were not included in this analysis. We first identified the HA clade to which each isolate belonged (Supplementary Table S4 online). As observed in the genotypic analysis, the HA of the EU H1av (lineage 1C) isolates belonged to two clades: 1C.2.1 (32 isolates) and 1C.2.2 (10 isolates). On the other hand, the HA of all the EU H1hu (lineage 1B) swIAV isolates belonged to clade 1B.1.2.1 (21 isolates). The HA of the H1pdm09 (lineage 1A) swIAV isolates belonged to clade 1A.3.3.2 (5 isolates). To characterize the evolution of the isolates, we compared aa identities in the HA1 domain of the HA genes of 68 isolates with those of historical and contemporary swIAV circulating in pigs in Europe and North America as well as human influenza viruses. A phylogenetic tree based on the HA1 sequences of the isolates and the reference viruses is shown in Fig. 2.Figure 2Phylogenetic tree of H1 swIAV isolates and reference viruses. HA1 amino acid sequences from clades 1A, 1B and 1C of H1 influenza A viruses were aligned using the MAFFT web bioinformatics framework35. The constructed tree was presented and edited with FigTree V1.4.4 software (v1.4.4). The names of the isolates are shown in black while those of the reference viruses are colored according to their lineages: EU H1av (green), EU H1hu (red), H1pdm09 (blue), US H1γ (light blue), US H1δ (orange), human H1 viruses (purple).Full size imageThe HA1 contains the known immunodominant epitopes and the receptor binding site31. The genetic relatedness of HA1 genes of the isolates and those of the reference viruses are shown in Supplementary Table S1 online. Among the EU H1av viruses, the highest genetic diversity in the HA1 was observed between the isolates of both clades 1C.2.1 and 1C.2.2, and clade 1C.1 reference virus (% aa identity ≤ 88.7). Percentage aa identities with reference viruses belonging to clade 1C.2.1 and clade 1C.2.2 were higher, i.e. between 92.0 and 96.8 for clade 1C.2.1 isolates and between 91.1 and 95.1 for clade 1C.2.2 isolates. The EU H1hu isolates (clade 1B.1.2.1) showed varying genetic relationships with the EU H1hu reference viruses of clades 1B.1 (89.2–91.1% aa identity) and 1B.1.2.1 (87.5–96.0% aa identity). As expected, they were divergent from the US H1δ clades 1B.2.2.2 (82.5–84.6% aa identity) and 1B.2.2.1 (80.4–82.5% aa identity) reference viruses. These viruses were also more divergent from the recent human seasonal viruses, NC99 and BR07 (82.8–87.4% aa identity) as compared with the past human seasonal virus, TW86 (89.0–90.5% aa identity). The human viruses (TW86, NC99, BR07) are classified as other-human 1B.2 according to the H1 classification system4. Due to its close genetic relationship with the EU H1hu viruses (1B.1.2.1), and also for clear comparisons in this study, we show TW86 as belonging to 1B.1-like clade. We consider TW86 as the ancestor virus of the EU H1hu viruses. As expected, the H1pdm09 isolates were more closely related to reference viruses of the same clade 1A.3.3.2 (88.7–97.2% aa identity) than to the US H1γ virus of clade 1A.3.3.3 (84.4–89.3% aa identity), which is their supposed precursor. However, out of the five H1pdm09 virus isolates, one strain was more divergent from reference viruses of the same clade. This virus shared only 88.7% aa identity with reference viruses, compared to 91.4–97.2% for the other four isolates. The H1 of all isolates were closely related to those of reference viruses of clades known to circulate in European swine, but they were distant from H1 of reference viruses representing clades that only circulate in North America. Thus, there was no indication of a spillover of North American swIAV strains into the European swine population.We also examined the genetic relatedness at antigenic sites between the virus isolates and the reference viruses. The HA1 of H1 influenza viruses contains receptor binding sites surrounded by five antigenic sites—Sa, Sb, Ca1, Ca2 and Cb—which contain 50 aa in total31,37. We determined percentage aa identities among these 50 aa (Supplementary Table S5 online). We observed a similar trend of genetic relatedness as that in the aa of the entire HA1, but percentage aa identities at antigenic sites were way lower than in the HA1 (Supplementary Table S1 A-D online). This indicates that aa changes occur more frequently at antigenic sites.We also evaluated the rate of aa substitution in the HA1 of H1 isolates. The substitution rates, as determined by BEAST analysis, suggest that the EU H1av swIAV evolve at a mean rate of 4.06 × 10–3 substitutions per site per year (95% highest posterior density (HPD): 3.18 × 10–3, 5.02 × 10–3), while the EU H1hu swIAV evolve at a mean rate of 3.76 × 10–3 substitutions per site per year (95% HPD: 3.02 × 10–3, 4.55 × 10–3). This indicates that the mean rate of evolution of the EU H1av viruses is faster than that of the EU H1hu viruses. We could not determine the substitution rates of the H1pdm09 swIAV isolates because there were only five isolates in this group of viruses.Antigenic characterization of the HA of swIAV isolatesTo determine antigenic relationships within and between H1 swIAV lineages, we performed HI assays with 71 H1 swIAV isolates and antisera against 16 historical and contemporary European and North American swIAV strains as well as human influenza A strains (Supplementary Table S2 online). There were 43 EU H1av isolates, 23 EU H1hu isolates and 5 H1pdm09 isolates. Using the obtained HI data, we generated a 3D antigenic map (Fig. 3). The swIAV isolates formed two antigenic clusters. The EU H1av isolates (light green spheres) clustered with EU H1av reference viruses (dark green spheres) as well as with the H1pdm09 (dark blue spheres) and US H1γ (blue spheres) reference viruses. On the other hand, the EU H1hu isolates (pink spheres) clustered with EU H1hu reference viruses (maroon spheres) and one human reference virus (purple sphere). All EU H1av isolates, regardless of the clade they belonged to, reacted with antisera against EU H1av reference viruses (HI titers ≥ 40). On the other hand, all EU H1hu isolates except for three isolates that failed to react with swSC94, reacted with antisera against EU H1hu reference viruses (HI titers ≥ 40). Low (HI titers ≤ 40) or no cross-reactivity was observed between viruses belonging to these two lineages. The EU H1av isolates also reacted with antisera against the H1pdm09 and the US H1γ reference viruses. However, all isolates (except 2) reacted with antisera against CA09 (H1pmd09) while only a few isolates, 12 and 7 out of 43, reacted with antisera against SL15 (H1pdm09) and OH07 (US H1γ) reference viruses respectively. There was low (HI titer ≤ 40) or no cross-reactivity between all the isolates and the US H1δ viruses (orange spheres) and human viruses (purple spheres) except for reactivity between the EU H1hu isolates and one past human virus, TW86 (HI titer ≥ 40 for 16 out of 23 isolates). Two of these isolates also had a titer of 80 against NC99.Figure 3Antigenic diversity of H1 swIAV isolated in Belgium and the Netherlands in 2014–2019. A 3D map was constructed based on the reactivity of the isolates in HI assay, with sera against the reference viruses, which included: dark green sphere EU H1av, maroon sphere EU H1hu, dark blue sphere H1pdm09, blue sphere US H1γ, orange sphere US H1δ1 and purple sphere Human H1. The H1 isolates are colored using lighter shades of the color of the reference viruses belonging to the same or related lineage: light green sphere EU H1av, pink sphere EU H1hu and light blue sphere H1pdm09. The virus strains are shown as spheres while the respective antisera are shown as semi-transparent cubes. Antigenic distances of the three H1pdm09 outliers from the H1pdm09 reference virus (CA09) are shown with red arrows. The squares in the grid represent antigenic distances. One square is equal to a two-fold change in HI titer, which is equal to 1 antigenic unit (AU). Analysis of the table vs map distance was conducted generating a moderately high r2 score value (r2 = 0.71).Full size imageAntigenic distances from the reference viruses ranged between 0.7 to 7.0 AU within EU H1av and 0.4 to 7.6 AU within EU H1hu isolates (Supplementary Table S3). On the other hand, antigenic distances within the H1pdm09 isolates ranged between 0.8 and 13.2 AU. Two out the five H1pdm09 isolates had antigenic distances ranging between 2.6 and 6.5 AU away from the EU H1av reference viruses, similar to what was observed within the EU H1av isolates. Their distances from the H1pdm09 reference viruses ranged between 0.8 and 2.1 AU. The other three were outliers (as shown on the map), with antigenic distances ranging between 6.7 and 13.2 AU from the EU H1av reference viruses and 4.8 to 13.3 from the H1pdm09 reference viruses.Overall, all isolates were antigenically divergent from the US H1δ viruses and the recent human viruses (NC99 and BR07) as displayed on the map.We retrieved antigenic distances from the antigenic map and examined distances of the EU H1av and EU H1hu isolates from their supposed ancestor viruses, swFI82 and TW86 respectively (Fig. 4). We observed more antigenic diversity from the ancestor virus within the EU H1av isolates (1.1 to 7.0 AU) as compared to the EU H1hu isolates (2.1 to 6.6 AU). The average evolution rates determined from antigenic distances between the ancestor viruses and viruses isolated in 2019, showed that the EU H1av isolates evolved at a rate of 0.15 AU per year while the EU H1hu isolates evolved at a rate of 0.10 AU per year. Taken together, these results suggest that the EU H1av viruses evolve at a slightly higher rate as compared to the EU H1hu viruses.Figure 4Antigenic distances of the EU H1av isolates (a) and EU H1hu isolates (b) from their ancestor viruses swFI82 and TW86 respectively. The virus isolates are shown in orange circles while the reference viruses are colored differently; green circle EU H1av, magenta circle EU H1hu and grey circle Human H1.Full size imageIn order to explain the antigenic differences observed between viruses within the same lineage, we examined aa substitutions that have been previously considered important, and associated with antigenic changes38,39,40. These included aa substitutions R43L, F71I, K141E, E153K, E155G, N156D, D187N, S271P and a deletion at aa position 130 (Δ130). Three of these aa positions (43, 130, 271) are located outside the antigenic sites. Among the EU H1av viruses, substitution E155G (13 out of 42 isolates) was observed between EU H1av reference virus, swFI82, and the isolates (Table 3). Ten of these isolates had antigenic distances ranging between 5.0 and 6.8 AU away from swFI82. Distances between the other three isolates and swFI82 were < 5.0 AU. Interestingly, two out of these three also had another common substitution, L71I. In total, 11 EU H1av isolates had the L71I substitution. For the EU H1hu isolates, there were no aa substitutions at these putative important positions when compared to TW86 or the EU H1hu reference viruses expect for two viruses. One virus had an aa substitution at position 141, while the other virus had a substitution at position 153. On the other hand, aa substitutions R43L, I71F, E141K, N187D and S271P were observed between the EU H1hu isolates and the US H1δ reference viruses. The same substitutions were also observed with the recent human viruses NC99 and BR07. This could explain the antigenic differences observed between the EU H1hu isolates and US H1δ and the two more recent human viruses. Among the five H1pdm09 isolates, substitutions were observed in three of them: swG228/14 (E155G, D187S), swG220/19 (K43R, D187S) and swG235/19 (E155T, D187N). These three viruses were shown to be antigenically divergent from their 2009 precursor in the antigenic map. The most divergent H1pdm09 isolate, swG235/19, also had additional aa substitutions, N156D, which has been previously associated with antigenic changes40.Table 3 Presence ( +) or absence (-) of important amino acid substitutions or deletion (Δ).Full size tableDiscussionWe isolated 89 swIAV from pigs in Belgium and the Netherlands between the year 2014 and 2019, mainly H1 (71) and only a few H3 viruses (18). Because of the limited number of H3 viruses, we focused on the characterization of H1 swIAV isolates. Most of these (47.2%) had an HA derived from the EU H1av (1C) lineage and could be divided into two clades; 1C.2.1 and 1C.2.2. We isolated fewer EU H1hu (1B) lineage viruses (27%) all belonging to clade 1B.1.2.1. Only a few isolates (5.6%) had an HA derived from the H1pdm09 (1A) lineage and they all belonged to clade 1A.3.3.2.For the first time, we isolated viruses with HA derived from the H1pdm09 lineage from pigs in Belgium. In the Netherlands, however, reassortant viruses containing all genes except the NA from the H1pdm09 viruses have been reported since 201221,22. Reassortant EU H1av viruses containing the M gene from the H1pdm09 lineage were also detected in Belgium during this study period.The predominance of the EU H1av viruses and low incidences of the H1pdm09 viruses have also been reported in countries across mainland Europe21,22,41,42,43,44. The EU H1av swIAV were found in proportions ranging between 27.9% and 69.6% in these countries, while the H1pdm09 swIAV accounted for up to 9.1% of the circulating strains. In the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, in contrast, the H1pdm09 viruses circulate at high frequencies of 36% and 56.3% respectively22.Full-length genomes of 18 isolates revealed the presence of previously reported genotypes21,22,43, with all except one virus containing the M gene from the H1pdm09 lineage. swIAV circulating in European pigs continue to exchange genes amongst each other resulting in second generation reassortants with different genotypes from their precursors. Especially, reassortants with the H1pdm09 viruses being on the rise, as these have also been reported in other studies. The three new genotypes of swIAV that were identified in this study resulted from the replacement of the M gene of the EU H1av viruses with that of the H1pdm09 virus. swIAV genotypes with the M gene from the H1pdm09 lineage have become established in swIAV throughout Europe. In fact, in the study by Henritzi and colleagues22, EU H1av viruses carrying the M gene from the H1pdm09 had the second-highest prevalence of genome constellations. Experimental studies in guinea pig and ferret models have associated the M gene from the H1pdm09 viruses with efficient transmission of influenza viruses45,46,47. Using reverse genetics to introduce the M gene of the H1pdm09 virus A/Netherlands/602/2009 into a background of A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1), Campbell and colleagues found an increase in NA activity. This H1pdm09 M-NA interaction is thought to lead to efficient transmission of influenza A viruses45. In the United States, H3N2 variant (H3N2v) viruses that contained the M gene from the H1pdm09 virus caused human infections in 2011–201248 and in 201649,50. Although influenza variant viruses rarely result in sustained human-to-human transmissions, this raises concerns about the pandemic potential of these variant viruses. The role of the M gene from the H1pdm09 virus in H1 swIAV therefore, needs to be explored further.The antigenic evolution within both the EU H1av and the EU H1hu swIAV was observed to be slow, in that the antisera against the past reference viruses isolated as early as 1982 and 1986 still reacted with the viruses isolated in 2014–2019. Despite this, the rate of evolution of the EU H1av was slightly faster than that of the EU H1hu swIAV isolates, both at the antigenic level (0.15 AU per year vs 0.10 AU per year) and at the genetic level (4.06 × 10–3 substitutions per site per year vs 3.76 × 10–3 substitutions per site per year aa substitutions). Amino acid substitution E155G has been previously shown to affect receptor binding specificity of H1 influenza viruses38,51,52. Most of the EU H1av isolates (10 out of 13) with this aa substitution had great antigenic distances (5.0–6.8 AU) from their ancestor virus. While this may not be the sole factor influencing the observed antigenic changes, we speculate that the role of this substitution in receptor binding specificity impacted HI results and hence the increased antigenic distances. The EU H1hu isolates and their human ancestor virus, on the other hand, shared the same aa among the ones considered important. Yet great antigenic distances were observed between the EU H1hu isolates and the US H1δ swIAV as well as the recent human viruses (NC99 and BR07). Interestingly, aa substitution F71I was observed between these viruses and the EU H1hu isolates. Amino acid substitution at position 71 has been shown to drive antigenic drift both in swine and human H1 influenza viruses38,39, and could explain the antigenic distances observed. Three out of the five H1pdm09 isolates were antigenically divergent from the H1pdm09 reference viruses (4.8 – 12.9 AU). These three isolates shared aa substitutions at position 187 (D187S or D187N). Substitution D187N has been shown to correlate with antigenic changes38. Position 187 is also part of the receptor-binding site53 meaning that these substitutions could influence receptor-binding capacity of these viruses and lead to changes in HI titers. This could possibly explain the observed antigenic divergence of the three isolates. An additional aa substitution was N156D, which was present in the isolate swG235/19, and has been associated with large changes in biophysical properties of the H1pdm09 viruses40. This substitution could be the reason why this isolate was antigenically different from the rest. Although the described amino acid substitutions, which are mainly from previous studies may have been the cause of the observed antigenic differences in this study, we cannot rule out the fact that other mutations that we observed but have not been previously described, also impacted the antigenicity of the isolates.As explained earlier, introduction of swine viruses to humans poses a risk to public health. We recently reported a case of human infection with one of the EU H1av isolates from the current study, A/swine/Netherlands/Gent-193/2019 (Fig. 1) in a farmer in the Netherlands54. What draws our attention is the lack of antibodies against these viruses in the human population. A recent serological study showed that humans largely lack HI and virus neutralizing antibodies against the EU H1av swIAV, with seroprevalence rates against these viruses being ≤ 10%55. Henritzi and colleagues, in contrast, reported low neutralizing activity of human plasma against only a few strains of H1 avian-like viruses, while the majority of adult human sera revealed moderate to high titers22. If these viruses would acquire the ability to replicate and transmit in humans, they would have considerable pandemic potential. Apart from the EU H1av viruses, the EU H1hu viruses may also pose a threat to humans. The antigenic clustering of the EU H1hu isolates with the oldest human H1 virus from 1986 and not with the more recent human H1 viruses isolated in 1999 or later, indicate a slow evolution of these human-derived viruses in swine. Swine, therefore, serve as reservoirs for the past viruses that ceased to circulate in humans. Over the years, the human population immunity against these swIAV will gradually decrease. Because the younger human population will be lacking immunity against the circulating swIAV that were initially introduced from humans, there will be an increased chance of re-introduction of these viruses into humans. Although re-introduction of a virus to a population that lacks immunity rarely results in a pandemic, such a possibility cannot be ignored. This was illustrated by the 2009 pandemic virus. This virus inherited its HA from a North American swIAV, which is a descendant of the 1918 pandemic H1N1 virus. In 2009, only humans born before 1930–40 had cross-reactive antibodies against the new pandemic virus, so the virus could easily spread among the younger population56. Such a scenario could occur in the future with other swIAV, if these viruses will manage to adapt to, replicate and become transmissible in humans. The results of this study stress the importance of frequent surveillance of swIAV, as well as monitoring of the evolution of these viruses for better preparedness in the event of a pandemic.

In this study we compared influenza activity indicators in our country after the implementation of public health measures for COVID-19. We compared indicators of influenza activity in 2020 before and after public health measures were taken to reduce COVID-19 with the corresponding indicators from three preceding years and the immediate one, and the potential decrease in seasonal influenza cases/deaths. Nationwide surveillance data revealed a drastic decline in influenza diagnosis in outpatient clinics and public hospitals, influenza positivity rates of clinical specimens, and confirmed severe cases during the following 10 weeks of 2020 as lockdown activities and control measures were established compared with the same period of 2019. Our results suggest that the measures taken for COVID-19 were effective in reducing the spread of other viral respiratory diseases as influenza in our country.

We examined the effect of these COVID-19 measures on influenza incidence as a proxy for determining the overall potential reduction in respiratory virus transmission.Mexico, like other Latin American countries, established population confinement and a reduction in its economic activity to face the coronavirus pandemic and the respiratory disease it generates, COVID-19. The Mexican Ministry of Health established a package of prevention measures called "National Protocol for Healthy Distance", effective as of Monday, March 23, 2020, to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the community2. These control strategies focused on social distancing and basic prevention measures and were aligned with those used for other common respiratory viral infections such as influenza: use of face masks, avoiding contact when greeting, hand washing, cough etiquette, temperature monitoring, home confinement, and avoiding close contact with sick individuals. In addition to this, cancellation of large-scale events, the lockdown of activities at all levels of education and workplaces (e.g., segregated teams and home-office working wherever possible) and non-essential activities of the public, social, and private sectors were temporarily suspended, and the reprogramming of massive events was raised. Also, intensive public health education on public and personal hygiene and social responsibility was established3.We compared influenza activity indicators in 2020 before and after public health measures were taken to reduce COVID-19 with the corresponding indicators from the three preceding years and the immediately previous one, as well as the involvement in the decrease of seasonal influenza cases.MethodsWe obtained routine sentinel surveillance data on influenza-like illnesses (ILI) from the official reports of the Mexican Ministry of Health and the National Centre of epidemiological surveillance for all weeks since 20164. ILI were defined as fever (> 38 °C) and cough. ILI samples were tested by using influenza-specific real time RT-PCR assay to identify influenza virus infection and then percentage of influenza cases were registered per week. Deaths caused by confirmed influenza virus infection analyzed were taken from the total confirmed cases reported in the official weekly epidemiological reports, which are open and available to the public.We evaluated whether the influenza trends in the 2019–2020 season were different before and after the COVID-19 National Protocol for Healthy Distance was implemented compared to previous seasons by using a quasi-experimental difference-in-difference design. We extracted weekly reports of seasonal influenza cases data from the 2016–2017 season to the 2019–2020 season from epidemiological (EPI) week 40 to EPI week 30, using the open-access databases of the public health authority4.We compared the number of influenza cases in season 2019–2020 and the average of the corresponding periods in the previous three influenza seasons (2016–2019). The normal distribution of the data was analyzed using a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, finding that the data presented a normal distribution and the LINE condition was met, allowing the use of the t test to perform the statistical analysis for each EPI week using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 23.05.Ethics approvalNot necessary, the data analyzed is publically available on Secretariat of Health of México databases.Consent to participateNot necessary.

The influenza season spans from October to March, including autumn and winter (2 years, weeks 40–20).We compared indicators of influenza transmissibility (confirmed cases and deaths) in 2020 against the average from corresponding periods in the three preceding influenza seasons (2016–2020). Figure 1 shows trends in seasonal influenza cases from the 2016–2017 season to the 2019–2020 season in Mexico. The average influenza activity peaked in EPI weeks 3–7 in the last four influenza seasons and declined by week 15 every year (Fig. 1). Annually in our country, on average, around 500–1000 people die from laboratory-confirmed influenza (Fig. 1)6.Figure 1Trends of influenza activity and influenza-related deaths during the 2019–2020 season compared with average of the preceding 3 years (between EPI weeks of May 2016 to July 2020).Full size imageIn Mexico, the number of seasonal influenza cases in the 2019–2020 season was lower after COVID-19 transmission compared to previous years (Figs. 1, 2A). We observed the peak of influenza cases in week 4. Particularly, the average of influenza cases at week 4 was significantly different (p < 0.05) from the previous two influenza seasons (587 vs 357.33 ± 99.6; respectively).Figure 2Trends of influenza activity during the 2019–20 season. (A) Influenza and COVID-19 activity in México from EPI weeks 1–30 of year 2020; (B) Influenza activity between EPI weeks 1–30; (C) Influenza deaths comparison between 2019 and 2020 by EPI week.Full size imageThe number of influenza cases decreased below the average of previous years in EPI week 12 (2017–2019). In addition, we observed that after EPI week 12, in Mexico, 9 weeks had passed since the detection of the first SARS-CoV-2 case and the number of COVID-19 cases was increasing (Fig. 2A). The healthy distance protocol was officially established in EPI week 13. It was observed that simultaneously the cases of influenza were decreasing and were unusually low after week 20 compared to previous years. Even when measures to contain the transmission of the new respiratory disease were established (EPI week 13), the number of COVID-19 cases increased while prevalence of influenza declined (Fig. 2A). In fact, the number of influenza cases in 2020 decreased significantly (p < 0.05) from EPI week 22 to 30 compared to the seasons 2016–2019 (Fig. 2B). It is important to highlight that this phenomenon indicates a significant difference in the transmission mechanisms and the pathogenesis of these two diseases.We performed a weekly paired difference t test using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, (Version 23.0)5. We found that the percentage of influenza cases decreased by 64% (p = 0.001) and the estimated daily number of influenza cases decreased by 76% (p = 0.002) in EPI week 20 of season 2019–2020 compared with the preceding years (Fig. 2B). Additionally, before EPI week 20, the number of deaths in 2020 from influenza per EPI week was statistically similar (p > 0.05) to the average of the seasons 2016–2019 (Figs. 1, 2C). In contrast, we saw no significant changes in deaths, only in the percentage of influenza positivity (31%; p = 0.008), in EPI weeks 21–30 of 2019–2020 compared with preceding seasons (Figs. 1, 2C).The COVID-19 epidemic has altered social and health behaviors, resulting in an unexpected reduction of seasonal influenza cases. Influenza disease has not been detected by our national laboratories since May 8th. This dramatic decrease is unlikely to be related to climatic variations as the number of laboratory‐confirmed influenza A were similar during the same weeks in 2019 (relative risk 1.3, 95% CI 0.4–3.8, p = 0.7), which was consistent with the typical transmission pattern in Mexico.In addition, both the number of influenza strains isolated from clinical specimens in commissioned laboratories and the positivity rate dropped drastically in 2020; the trends were different from 2019 (p < 0.05 for both). In the 2019–2020 influenza season (weeks 40–30), circulation of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 (47%), B (30%), A (H3N2) (19%) and influenza A non-subtypeable (4%) was observed. In week 20, the cumulative positivity rate was 8.9%, which decreased by week 30 with only two cases of non-subtypeable Influenza A identified (Fig. 3).Figure 3Circulating Influenza types in EPI weeks 1–30 of year 2020.Full size imageDiscussionAccording to the WHO, the lethality of COVID-19 is higher than for seasonal influenza (usually well below 0.1%). COVID-19 mortality seems to differ according to the region6. Until now, it is estimated that the crude mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases) is between 3–4%; therefore, the infection mortality rate (the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infections) will be lower. However, for both diseases, mortality is determined to a large extent by regional access to and quality of healthcare services.In our country, the functional healthcare and surveillance systems installed, the government’s efforts to identify ILI cases during the COVID-19 pandemic, and adequate laboratory capacity guarantee an appropriate influenza testing and reporting of results. As reported by other countries, public health initiatives to control COVID-19 spread probably helped to decrease influenza transmission and number of cases in May 2020 because both viruses share the same transmission mechanisms through the respiratory route and contact, although with different efficiency giving a basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 higher than that of seasonal influenza, then a reduction in transmission could reduce the impact of COVID-19, thereby preventing the increase of mortality. The modeling of the effective reproduction number for COVID-19 in Mexico in May 2020 (National Secretariat of Health) at 0.5–1, is lower (55–77% less) than the mean estimated R0 for this virus (2.2)7. The observed 61% reduction in influenza transmission is consistent with the information above8.Due to the measures implemented in our country to contain the COVID-19 cases, there were severe changes in the availability of medical care and assistance, including hospitalization. Avoidance of medical care during this period may be a major confounder in interpreting our results. It is important to note that due to the similarity in symptoms between COVID-19 and influenza and the low number of COVID-19 patients in Mexico (< 200 cases as of March 21, 2020), ILI patients would seek help for a differential diagnosis. The reduction of the availability of medical care also did not explain the lower number of severe influenza cases seen in 2020 (Fig. 2C). Therefore, we believe that the decline in influenza activity in Mexico in 2020 is the result of the strict control measures that were put in place in response to COVID-19.During the last winter season, European countries and the North American region (United States, Canada and Northern Mexico) have reported fluctuations in the number of cases of seasonal influenza different from experienced in previous seasons (since EPI week 4, 2019–2020 season) European countries and North America region (United States, Canada and North Mexico) have reported similar trends in the fluctuation of seasonal influenza cases from those experienced in previous seasons. In contrast, some Asian regions experienced different trends in influenza incidence during this season, from those experienced in past years9,10. The total number of patients infected with influenza in countries like Hong Kong, Japan, and Taiwan was significantly lower after EPI week 4 of the 2019–2020 season than in previous influenza seasons11.We can mention some limitations in our study. First, due to the seasonal bimodal pattern of influenza incidence in Mexico, it is expected that influenza cases diminish around March–May. However, this year the number of cases fell to almost zero. Second, it is important to consider an underdiagnosis of ILI’s due to the fear of leaving home in search of medical attention and catching coronavirus, as well as being classified as COVID-19, all this contributes to generating an altered pattern11. Third, if we consider a similar dynamic for COVID-19, we will also have to record a higher number of cases for COVID-19 due to the underdiagnosis and the presentation of asymptomatic cases12,13.In conclusion, we found a marked decline in influenza cases in Mexico after the implementation of public health measures for COVID-19. Definitively, the containment measures to reduce the risk of contagion for the new respiratory disease was additionally efficient for influenza, but with greater magnitude. This is partly explained by the different transmission mechanisms of these two respiratory diseases, the virulence of each viral agent, the absence of immunity in the population, and the diverse virological factors inherent in each pathogen. Our results suggest that such measures are useful in reducing the spread of viral respiratory diseases and their establishment mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially now that we are entering into a new influenza season.

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. Associated Press By: Scripps National Posted and last updated With social distancing measures in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic, confirmed cases of influenza plummeted during the 2020-2021 flu season.According to data published on the CDC's website, U.S. clinical health labs and public health labs reported just 2,124 confirmed flu cases between Sept. 27, 2020 and May 15, 2021 (though the true number of people who contracted the flu was likely higher).Those 2,124 cases represent an extreme decline in the spread of the flu compared to the 2019-2020 season. Between October 2019 and April 2020, the CDC estimated that at least 39 million people contracted the flu.It wasn't just the U.S. The World Health Organization says that worldwide flu cases also fell to minuscule levels during the 2020-2021 flu season.It's clear that social distancing and universal mask mandates impacted the plummeting levels of flu cases in the winter of 2020 and 2021. Data from the CDC shows that patients visiting doctor's offices for influenza-like illnesses plummeted in March and April of 2020 and have remained low ever since. CDC But while decreased levels of flu cases may seem like a welcome sign, it's in some ways left doctors in the dark on how they plan to handle the next flu season.Scientific American reports that each year's flu vaccine is based on strains of influenza that have been circulating the previous season. In February, the WHO made recommendations for next year's vaccine but was forced to do so on much less information than they have in previous years.While there are concerns that the flu vaccine may not be as effective next season, doctors are hopeful that less spread in 2020-2021 meant there was less of a chance for mutated streams, which would keep vaccines effective.

Now her daughter, 76-year-old Sigrid Stokes, a semi-retired California registered nurse, is volunteering to give COVID-19 vaccine injections. (Feb. 5)APThe claim: There have only been 2,300 cases this flu seasonAs restaurants and retailers across the nation continue to drop mask requirements for the fully vaccinated following new federal guidance, the importance of masking is being highlighted in one social media post claiming the practice has helped lower flu cases this season. "I just want to point out that all this 'useless mask usage and hand-washing' have also given us the lowest number of flu cases ever recorded," said Twitter user Tennesseine in a May 14 tweet shared to Facebook on May 19. The post says there have been only 2,300 flu cases, compared to 38 million cases and 22,000 deaths that supposedly occurred in the U.S. last year. The post was shared about 10,000 times in the first week after it was posted.Fact check: COVID-19 vaccine won't jeopardize your life insurance coverageIt's reasonable to imagine preventative measures against one respiratory illness, such as COVID-19, could confer protection against another like the flu, also known as influenza. But does the figure of 2,300 cases accurately reflect the state of current flu activity in the U.S.?Possibly, but not exactly. Number of flu cases is a rough estimateThe 2,300 figure Tennesseine cites is not an exact number, he told USA TODAY. "The figures are all over the place because the CDC is torturously slow about releasing seasonal data," he told USA TODAY. "I had to cobble that estimate together from weekly reports, updates throughout the season, etc." While the 38 million flu cases and 22,000 deaths is based on 2019-2020 data, one can't directly compare those numbers to an estimate of this season's flu cases, said Kate Grusich, a public affairs specialist for the CDC. "One is an estimate of the burden of influenza based on a mathematical model and the other refers to data reported in the U.S. influenza surveillance report information from the U.S. influenza surveillance system," she said in an email to USA TODAY. Fact check: Comparison between COVID-19 and cancer death rate misleadingSurveillance data may drastically underrepresent the true burden of the flu in the U.S., so statistical models are used to estimate the annual number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths. This was something the CDC could not do for the 2020-2021 season because low flu activity meant there wasn't enough data to make estimates. The CDC maintains both sets of numbers because they serve different purposes, Grusich said. Surveillance helps track how the flu is progressing on a week-to-week basis, while the model-based estimates are a more accurate overall representation of the number of cases and deaths.What if the low number of flu cases just meant fewer people getting tested or diagnosed? That's likely not the case, said Dr. Lee Riley, professor of epidemiology and infectious disease at the University of California Berkeley's School of Public Health. "I think (the number of cases) is still low, because if there were a lot (of flu cases) of epidemic proportions, it would have been recognized," he told USA TODAY. Fact check: No link between India's falling COVID-19 cases and hydroxychloroquineDr. John Swartzberg, clinical professor emeritus also of UC Berkeley's School of Public Health, agreed."I think we would have seen the typical number of hospitalizations and deaths if we weren't just diagnosing (influenza)," he told USA TODAY. COVID-19 preventative response has helped mitigate the fluBoth Riley and Swartzberg agree with what most public health experts now believe: mask mandates and social distancing have helped stifle influenza. "I've been an infectious specialist for 45 years. I've never seen anything approaching what we've seen this year in terms of the number of influenza cases," Swartzberg said. "There's only one major (explanation) that can be reasonably entertained — the nonpharmaceutical interventions we instituted to protect ourselves from COVID."Riley said face masks, social distancing and lockdowns all played a role in limiting the spread of the flu. Fact check: No, COVID-19 vaccine isn't transmitted to others via contact"If you go to Asia, especially like Japan during the flu season, almost everybody is wearing masks, and yet they still have epidemics," he said. "(When COVID-19 happened) they made a real concerted effort to restrict social gathering and contact (tracing). And I think these activities probably had more of an impact on respiratory infections like influenza."Riley said it was important to note the lack of influenza now "is not related to any of the anti-COVID-19 measures being taken" but rather seasonality – the U.S. has entered an influenza off-season. The flu peaks between December and February, tapering off as late as May. Our rating: Missing contextBased on our research, we rate the claim there have been only 2,300 cases of flu this season MISSING CONTEXT, because without additional information it could be misleading. While it's true public health interventions used to mitigate COVID-19, such as face masks, social distancing and hygiene, have helped to also significantly reduce flu activity, the figure of 2,300 flu cases is an estimate, not an exact number, based on surveillance data publicly provided by the CDC. And the agency cautioned against using surveillance data to represent the burden of the flu nationwide because it does not fully capture every illness that occurs. It also warned against comparing any estimates to past flu season data since those numbers are based on statistical modeling.

But for parents, experts say, it's a matter of perspective. d3sign/Getty Images The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention made a strong statement about the effectiveness of vaccines when it decided that fully vaccinated people don't need to wear masks in most circumstances. But it left some parents concerned about how the change might affect children too young to be vaccinated. Dr. Paul Offit, who heads the vaccine education center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, says that the new mask guidance is mostly good news. "But I think that has made this world a little less safe for young children," he says. Sponsor Message Coronavirus Updates What The New Mask Guidance Means For Unvaccinated Kids — And Their Parents Even a vaccinated parent can occasionally get infected with the coronavirus. There's also a small risk that the virus can pass to an unvaccinated child. But the risk that a child gets seriously ill is extremely small — comparable to the risk that children face of having serious illness as a result of the flu. To date, out of more than 74 million children in the United States, there have been about 300 COVID-19 deaths and a few thousand serious illnesses. By comparison, the CDC registered 188 flu-related deaths in children during the 2019-2020 flu season. (This past year, there was essentially no flu season at all.) Hospitalization numbers look worse for COVID-19. But those numbers are inflated as a result of the CDC's reporting rules. The CDC requires every child admitted to a hospital to be tested for the coronavirus. Dr. Roshni Mathew, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the Stanford University School of Medicine, says experience at her hospital found that 45% of the time, a child who tested positive for the coronavirus was not actually sick with COVID-19. The findings have been published online in the journal Hospital Pediatrics. In those cases, hospitalization was due to "a completely unrelated diagnosis, like appendicitis or femur fracture or something else," she says. Health Where Did The Flu Go? Homebound Kids Shape A Mild Season For children in particular, the risk of serious consequences from COVID-19 is the same magnitude as the risk they face from the flu, she says. But many parents seem more worried about the new and less familiar disease. That anxiety is heightened by the new guidelines on mask-wearing. But experts urge parents to try not to worry too much. "If you stop going into stores because you're terrified you'll run into an unmasked person, that's probably overreacting," says Gretchen Chapman, a psychology professor who studies health conundrums like this at Carnegie Mellon University. Sponsor Message It's understandable why parents would feel that way, she says. Though these risks are very low, they're not zero. And people struggle to conceptualize the difference between small risks — for example, something that's 1 in 1,000 versus 1 in 1 million. "It doesn't seem that different to the person," Chapman says. But it's also a matter of perspective. A tiny risk has a small impact on the population as a whole, but parents understandably aren't thinking in terms of the population as a whole. "When you're a parent and you're thinking of your one or two kids, it's really all or nothing," Chapman says. "Of course, the probability is really, really low of that very bad event, but it's not zero." The risk is continuing to decrease, as COVID-19 rates fall and the chance of encountering an unmasked person with an infection diminishes. Shots - Health News FAQ: What You Need To Know About Pfizer's COVID Vaccine And Adolescents Soon, the whole question will be turned on its head. The challenge will be not to reassure parents about very low risks but to convince them to get their children vaccinated, to drive that low risk down even more. Right now, children 12 and older are eligible for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, but the vaccines are being tested in younger children. Once children are eligible, COVID-19 "becomes a vaccine-preventable infection," Mathew says, "so you'd take every opportunity to prevent every single pediatric death." Only about two-thirds of children end up being vaccinated for the flu. And vaccination is important not just for their own sake, but because children are a major reason that the flu spreads rapidly through communities. Health officials are likely to confront a similar challenge to convince parents to vaccinate their children against COVID-19.

This translates to about one in ten people. Estimated U.S. influenza burden from 2010-2020CDC Chances are, you don’t know anyone who got the flu this year, because it was a lot lower than normal. This plot shows how CDC usually tracks flu, which is the percentage of outpatient visits that are attributed to “influenza-like illness”, or ILI, in a network of around 3,000 care providers throughout the country. You can see that in a normal year the percentage maxes out somewhere between 5% and 7% during peak flu season. In the graph below, you can also see the anomalous 2009-2010 season, which peaked much earlier due to the emergence of a new flu strain that then caused a pandemic. Patterns of influenza-like illness in the US showing that the 2020-2021 flu season was the mildest ... [+] on record.CDC The 2020-2021 flu season is also shown, obviously much lower. In fact, at around 1.5%, the maximum ILI is only slightly greater than the typical level of summer flu. This figure should be interpreted with caution, however, because the 2020-2021 flu season was not like the others for one very obvious reason — Covid-19. Since ILI is based on symptoms and not testing, it’s quite likely that there are some Covid-19 cases mixed in. Much more importantly, people’s healthcare seeking behavior has changed this year. Some people have avoided health care facilities, for fear of being exposed to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. Possibly more significantly, other people may have sought additional health care, either because of a Covid-19 illness or fear that some other illness was Covid-19. If this were the case, the denominator in the calculation would be larger, causing % ILI to be correspondingly lower, but having nothing to do with the actual amount of influenza transmission.

For instance, even during the Covid-19 spike of November-December 2020, outpatient visits remained stable. If anything, there was a small reduction in outpatient visits overall during the 2020-2021 flu season. So, even if we can’t precisely quantify how % ILI in 2020-2021 compared with previous years, it is reasonable to conclude that it is much lower. Another way to measure the amount of flu activity is to look at influenza-related mortality. Only a very small percentage of influenza illnesses result in death (in 2019-2020 it was about one in two thousand symptomatic illnesses), but these are closely tracked through the National Center for Health Statistics Mortality Surveillance System. The following plot shows all pneumonia, influenza, and Covid-19 mortality from 2017 to the present. The most striking pattern, of course, is the three waves of Covid-19 in 2020. More subtly, but important for our purposes, is the virtual disappearance of influenza deaths in 2020 (the yellow regions along the bottom of the figure).Pneumonia, influenza, and Covid-19 mortality from 2017-2021CDC Pediatric influenza deaths are an even more reliable source of information. In 2004, influenza-associated pediatric mortality became a nationally notifiable condition, meaning that such deaths are required by law to be reported to the CDC. Fortunately, relatively few deaths are reported in any given year, typically from 100-200. During the 2020-2021 season, however, there was only one death, meaning that flu circulation among children had dropped to about one half of one percent of its usual level.Pediatric deaths from influenza in the US, 2017-2021.CDC Of course, the reason for this significant decline in flu is not mysterious. Flu is transmitted in the same way as Covid-19 — through droplets and aerosols generated while breathing and talking, and contaminated surfaces when those droplets land. The use of face masks and social distancing to combat Covid-19 was expected to have a major impact on flu transmission as well. Additionally, many children were not in school, which is a key factor in seasonal flu transmission. Why these interventions stopped flu in its tracks, but not Covid-19, is another matter.

As of April 2021, there are still many countries that do not have COVID-19 vaccines. Before the COVID-19 vaccines were developed, some evidence suggested that an influenza vaccine may stimulate nonspecific immune responses that reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection or the severity of COVID-19 illness after infection. This study evaluated the association between influenza vaccination and the risk of COVID-19 infection. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study with data from July 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020 with the Claims data from Symphony Health database. The study population was adults age 65 years old or older who received influenza vaccination between September 1 and December 31 of 2019. The main outcomes and measures were odds of COVID-19 infection and severe COVID-19 illness after January 15, 2020. We found the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of COVID-19 infection risk between the influenza-vaccination group and no-influenza-vaccination group was 0.76 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.75–0.77). Among COVID-19 patients, the aOR of developing severe COVID-19 illness was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.68–0.76) between the influenza-vaccination group and the no-influenza-vaccination group. When the influenza-vaccination group and the other-vaccination group were compared, the aOR of COVID-19 infection was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.93–0.97), and the aOR of developing a severe COVID-19 illness was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.80–1.13). The influenza vaccine may marginally protect people from COVID-19 infection.

Before the COVID-19 vaccines were developed, there was some evidence suggesting that an influenza vaccine may stimulate nonspecific immune responses that reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection or the severity of COVID-19 illness after infection2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Early evidence suggests that COVID-19 patients with positive influenza A immunoglobulin M (IgM) had a lower risk of mortality and severe COVID-19 illness compared with those who showed a negative IgM status2. Furthermore, it has been reported that influenza vaccination is associated with a lower risk of COVID-19 infection3,4,5. Studies have also shown that influenza vaccination is negatively associated with COVID-19 mortality in older adults6,7; in Brazil, a patient registry showed that patients who recently received an influenza vaccination had a lower odds of severe illness and mortality from COVID-198. Recent studies have also found that influenza vaccination is associated with moderate risk reduction in all-cause hospitalization and mortality among patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection9, and a lower risk of 60-day mortality among patients who tested positive for COVID-19 in an emergency department10.Older adults and patients with comorbidities are at greater risk of COVID-19 infection, and they are also more likely to develop severe illness after infection11,12. Given that the influenza vaccine is safe and currently available, it may be a quick and safe option to slow down the COVID-19 pandemic. Limited evidence exists about the association between influenza vaccination and the incidence of COVID-19 in elder population. While prior research suggests that influenza vaccination may reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection, healthy vaccine effect was not considered. Therefore, it is important to further evaluate the effect of influenza vaccination on risk of COVID-19 infection taking healthy vaccine effect into consideration. Given that older adults are especially vulnerable to COVID-19, the aim of the present study is to evaluate whether influenza vaccination (1) reduces the risk of COVID-19 infection and (2) reduces the severity of illness after being infected by COVID-19 in adults age 65 or older.MethodsThis cross-sectional observational study was conducted using the Symphony Health dataset (PRA Health Sciences, Raleigh, NC, USA) from the COVID-19 Research Database13. The COVID-19 Research Database was established with Institutional Review Board approval and an exemption from patient consent because it included only data considered to be de-identified by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), HIPAA-limited data, or non-HIPAA-covered data, along with the strong governance measures in place to control access to all data. The Symphony Health dataset was derived from pharmacy and medical claims from several sources including Medicare, which covers about 280 million patients (almost all older adults), 1.8 million prescribers, and 16,000 health plans in the United States.We used data collected from July 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020, about older adults (age 65 years old or older). To identify incident COVID-19 cases, we excluded individuals who had received a COVID-19 diagnosis before January 15, 2020. We also excluded individuals who had received an influenza vaccination on or after January 1, 2020 for two reasons. First, it generally takes 14 days for the body to develop antibodies against influenza after vaccination, so we hypothesized that the effect of the influenza vaccination would begin 14 days after the vaccination14. Second, although our design is closer to a cross-sectional study, we used the 14-day window to strengthen the temporality between influenza vaccination and COVID-19 infection. All the exposure (that is, influenza vaccination) occurred before the outcome (that is, COVID-19 infection). Figure 1 shows the timeline of covariate assessment, receipt of influenza or other vaccine, and outcomes.Figure 1Timeline of covariate assessment, receipt of influenza or other vaccine, and outcomes.Full size imageWe classified individuals into an influenza-vaccination group and a no-influenza-vaccination group on the basis of their influenza vaccination status between September 1, 2019, and December 31, 2019. The differences among vaccines were considered as covariates, including trivalent or quadrivalent, live attenuated or inactivated, and with or without an adjuvant. The intranasal influenza vaccine was not recommended to older adults, and we did not find any intranasal influenza vaccine users in our study sample. The National Drug Codes for the influenza vaccines and other vaccines were from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)15. Two outcomes were identified on and after January 15, 2020 in this study: incidence of COVID-19 infection and incidence of severe illness because of COVID-19 infection. These two outcomes follow the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s definition (Table S1)16.The covariates included in this study were as follows: age 75 or older, gender, vaccinated against a disease other than influenza between July 1 and December 31, whether the influenza vaccine contained an adjuvant, and comorbidities that may increase the risk of COVID-19. The four types of vaccines that are recommended by the CDC and commonly administered to older adults were adjusted in Analysis 1 and served as comparators in Analysis 2 (that is, herpes zoster, pneumococcal pneumonia, tetanus, and hepatitis A). The influenza vaccines included in this study were mainly FLUZONE High-Dose (Sanofi Pasteur Inc.) and FLUAD (Seqirus USA Inc.), which accounted for 56% and 29% of the study sample, respectively. These were the two vaccines that were recommended for older adults by the CDC. The use of other influenza vaccines was less than 5%. Both vaccines were trivalent in the study period; FLUZONE High-Dose is a vaccine without an adjuvant; FLAUD contains an adjuvant. Thus, we did not control the vaccine valency; instead, we adjusted the appearance of the adjuvant in multivariate analyses because a vaccine adjuvant may reduce COVID-19 severity17. Comorbidities were selected according to the CDC’s warning about at-risk populations, including asthma, chronic kidney disease with dialysis, chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus, hemoglobin disorders, immunocompromised, liver disease, serious heart conditions, and severe obesity (Table S1)18.Two analyses were performed in this study. We first compared the odds of contracting COVID-19 between individuals who received an influenza vaccination versus those who did not (Analysis 1). To clarify the healthy vaccine effect, we repeated the aforementioned analyses by comparing individuals who received an influenza vaccination to those who receive a vaccination other than for influenza (Analysis 2). Vaccines that are recommended for older adults were selected as the comparator (herpes zoster, pneumococcal pneumonia, tetanus, and hepatitis A).The risk of COVID-19 infection and severe COVID-19 illness were evaluated with univariate and multivariate logistic regressions. To compare the influenza-vaccination group with the no-influenza-vaccination group, we divided the study cohort into 2000 subcohorts because computing efficiency limited the processing of such a large amount of data at once. We calculated the odds ratio in each subcohort and used a meta-analysis approach to get the pooled results. The final result was pooled using a random-effects model. Data were managed using the Snowflake® data warehouse (Snowflake Inc., San Mateo, CA, USA), and the analyses were performed using SAS® version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).ResultsThe Symphony Health dataset included records from 56 million older adults (Fig. 2). About 13 million older adults received the influenza vaccination between September 1 and December 31 of 2019. More than 42 million older adults who did not receive an influenza vaccination were selected as a control group for the comparison in Analysis 1. In the same period, 4.7 million older adults received other vaccines (herpes zoster, pneumococcal pneumonia, tetanus, and hepatitis A), and nearly 1.8 million of them had not received an influenza vaccine. These 1.8 million patients were selected as a control group in Analysis 2.Figure 2Flow chart of patient selection and comparisons.Full size imageThe characteristics of the study cohorts are in Table 1. Individuals who had received either an influenza vaccination or other non-influenza vaccination tended to have a lower comorbidity burden compared to individuals who did not receive an influenza vaccination. Among individuals who did not receive an influenza vaccination, 1.2% of them had a COVID-19 infection and 0.02% of them developed severe COVID-19 illness. Those who received an influenza vaccination had a COVID-19 infection rate of 0.9% and a severe case rate of 0.01%. Those who received a vaccination for something other than influenza had a COVID-19 infection rate of 0.98% and a severe COVID-19 illness case rate of 0.01%. Those descriptive statistics show that older adults who received an influenza vaccination had the lowest rate of COVID-19 infection and the lowest severe COVID-19 illness case rate.Table 1 Characteristics of the three study cohorts: no influenza vaccination, influenza vaccination, and vaccination other than influenza.Full size tableWithout adjusting for any risk factors, the odds of getting COVID-19 infection for the influenza-vaccination group was 0.72 times that of the no-influenza-vaccination group, with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of 0.71–0.73 (Fig. 3). The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) from the pooled analysis was 0.76 (95% CI 0.75–0.77). The distributions of the aORs and their lower and upper limits from the 2000 subcohorts are shown in Fig. S1. Among COVID-19 patients, the crude odds ratio (OR) of developing severe illness was 0.70 (95% CI 0.66–0.74) in patients who had received an influenza vaccination compared to patients who did not receive an influenza vaccination, and the aOR was 0.72 (95% CI 0.68–0.76).Figure 3Effectiveness of influenza vaccine for protection against COVID-19 infection and severe COVID-19 illness. OR, odds ratio; CI, confidence interval.Full size imageIn Analysis 2, the crude OR of COVID-19 infection between the influenza-vaccination group and other-vaccination group was 0.93 (95% CI 0.92–0.95), and the multivariate aOR was 0.95 (95% CI 0.93–0.97). Among COVID-19 patients, the unadjusted OR of severe COVID-19 illness was 0.93 (95% CI 0.79–1.10) when the influenza-vaccination group was compared with the other-vaccination group, and the aOR was 0.95 (95% CI 0.80–1.13).DiscussionIn this study, older adults who had received an influenza vaccination were associated with a 24% reduction in the odds of getting a COVID-19 infection and a 28% reduction in the odds of developing a severe COVID-19 illness, compared to older adults who had not received influenza vaccination. When we compared individuals who had received an influenza vaccination to those who received a non-influenza vaccination, the protective effect against COVID-19 infection was reduced from 24% to 5% but remained significant. Receiving an influenza vaccination did not reduce the odds of developing severe illness in patients with COVID-19 infection when compared to receiving a non-influenza vaccination.Our results suggest that an influenza vaccination seems to have a protective effect against COVID-19 infection, which implies that an influenza vaccination may trigger nonspecific immune responses that help protect against COVID-19 infection. This finding was also consistent with prior evidence that suggested that an influenza vaccination may reduce the risk of a COVID-19 infection or severe COVID-19 illness3,4,5,6,7,8. There is also a hypothesis that immune responses in the influenza vaccine may induce bystander immunity against SARS-CoV-217.Although receiving an influenza vaccination was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of COVID-19 infection compared to not receiving an influenza vaccination, this effect may come from the healthy vaccine effect because people who were vaccinated may be healthier in general than those who were not vaccinated19. In addition, individuals who were vaccinated often have other health behaviors that may prevent the transmission of COVID-19 or reduce the severity of COVID-19 illness. The healthy vaccine effect may be reflected by the result that only a marginal effect was found when we compared the risk of COVID-19 infection between those who received an influenza vaccine and those who received a vaccine against something other than influenza; no difference in the risk of severe COVID-19 illness was observed between the influenza-vaccination group and the no-influenza-vaccination group. On the other hand, the marginal protective effects of influenza vaccination may be underestimated in this analysis as vaccination may increase individuals’ immunity against diseases in general20.Despite the positive findings, a few studies have reported a null association between influenza vaccination and risk of COVID-19 infection21,22,23. These studies defined COVID-19 infection by laboratory-confirmed cases instead of assessing clinical outcomes after infection; two of them evaluated the effects among healthcare workers, and none of them reported the results for individuals aged ≥ 65. Because healthcare workers and younger adults generally have better immunity, influenza vaccination may provide insignificant benefit effect against COVID-19 infection in these populations. Among individuals aged ≥ 65, influenza vaccination is associated with a slightly lower probability of COVID-19 infection as well as lower odds of hospitalization and death4,24.Study limitationIn this study, we selected four other vaccines that are recommended by the CDC to the older adults as comparators to avoid the healthy vaccine effect. However, vaccines against diseases other than influenza are only administered once in a lifetime or at an interval of many years in between vaccinations. In the present study, only older adults who had received a vaccination after July 2019 could be traced. Therefore, a potential misclassification of this covariate may exist. The results of the comparison between the influenza-vaccination group and the non-influenza-vaccination group should be conservative because individuals were required to have received at least one non-influenza vaccination to be included in the comparison group.Although the ethnicity and geographic location might affect the incidence of COVID-19 infection, we were unable to adjust for these two variables. In the Symphony Health dataset, 35% of older adults had no ethnic information, and only the first two digits of their zip codes were provided.Finally, we were unable to implement self-control or case-crossover designs to avoid the healthy vaccine effect because our data only covered one year19. However, one important assumption of the case-crossover design is that the outcome event can occur “bi-directionally" (that is, outcomes can occur before and after the exposure), and the event could be reversible25. Given that COVID-19 has been newly detected this year, it violates the bi-directional assumption. In short, it is impossible to identify an outcome event (that is, a COVID-19 case) before the exposure (that is, an influenza vaccination) because COVID-19 was not identified before 2020.ConclusionThe influenza vaccine may only marginally protect people from COVID-19 infection. However, it remains important to receive an influenza vaccination to reduce the risk of a co-infection of influenza and COVID-19. Because influenza and COVID-19 present with similar symptomatology and occupy the same medical resources, the influenza vaccine is crucial in reducing the number of severe influenza patients in order to free up resources that may be necessary to handle another wave of COVID-19 patients.

Still, it is predicted that such changes helped the virus to evade the mechanism that human cells use to block influenza viruses.Calvignac-Spencer said that the same process can be seen now during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic."It's interesting to make parallels — for example, the fact that there were multiple successive waves is a pattern which is intriguing," he added.He believes that due to the progress in science over the years, now scientists have the opportunity to learn more from the Covid-19 that was not available during the 1918 pandemic.TagscoronavirusPandemicCoronavirus PandemicCovid 19influenza virusspanish flu 19181918 spanish fluvirus variantsflu virusJoin our WhatsApp channel - no spam, only sharp analysisComments ↓Get Swarajya in your inbox.SubscribeMagazine PoliticsGround Report From Kerala: How Sangh And Civic Groups Are Convincing People That The Current Waqf Law Must Go Venu Gopal Narayanan18h In Defence Of The Maharajas Arunansh B Goswami and Sumit Kaushik1dEven Your Fourth-Generation Can't Bring Back Article 370: Amit Shah Slams Congress Leader Rahul Gandhi Kuldeep Negi1dEconomyBitcoin Hits All-Time High After Donald Trump's Victory, Election Of Pro-Crypto Candidates to US Congress Nishtha Anushree53m Trump's Presidency Can Benefit India As Investments And Trade Set To Be Diverted Away From China: Moody's Ratings Nishtha Anushree19hAccelerating India’s Economic Growth: How Consumption Holds The Key Sanjay Nayar1dInfrastructure Kuldeep Negi1Andhra Pradesh: CM Naidu Launches Demo Seaplane Flight From Vijayawada To Srisailam1d V Bhagya Subhashini2Bengaluru’s Metro Network To Expand 175 Km By 2026, Aiming For Seamless Citywide Access2d V Bhagya Subhashini3Indian Railways Plans To Export Refurbished Diesel Locomotives Amid Electrification Push2dDefenceAfter Armenia, France To Evaluate India's Pinaka Rocket System Amid Rising Defence Exports Nishtha Anushree7m Defence Ministry Seeks 'Green Clearance' For Additional Ammunition Storage Facilities Near LAC In Ladakh Vansh Gupta1dExplained: Why The Indian Air Force Must Take Criticism Of Its Uber Deal Seriously Prakhar Gupta3dWorldDonald Trump Becomes First Republican Presidential Candidate To Win Battleground State Nevada Since 2004 Kuldeep Negi1d 'Where Was The UN?': Freed Hamas Hostage Mia Shem Slams United Nations Over Lack Of Support For Hostages In Gaza Kuldeep Negi1dUS Pressure Mounts On Qatar To Expel Hamas Leaders After Gaza Ceasefire Talks Fail Kuldeep Negi2dCultureWhy Is TM Krishna Still Stalling In The Sangita Kalanidhi Case?

All they could have known, or felt, before they died in Germany in 1918 was their flu-ravaged lungs failing them, each breath getting harder and harder. Tens of millions of people like them died in the flu pandemic of 1918; they happened to be three whose lungs were preserved by a farsighted pathologist.A century later, scientists have now managed to sequence flu viruses from pea-size samples of the three preserved lungs. Together, these sequences suggest an answer to one of the pandemic’s most enduring mysteries: Why was the second wave, in late 1918, so much deadlier than the first wave, in the spring? These rediscovered lung samples hint at the possibility that the virus itself changed to better infect humans.This might sound familiar. The no-longer-so-novel coronavirus is also adapting to its human host. With modern tools, scientists are tracking the virus’s evolution in real time and finding mutations that have made the virus better at infecting us. More than 1.4 million coronavirus genomes have now been sequenced. But the database for the 1918 flu is much smaller—so much so that the comparison feels unfair. This new study brings the number of complete 1918 flu genomes to a grand total of three, plus some partial genomes.Hundred-year-old lung tissue is incredibly hard to find. Sébastien Calvignac-Spencer, a virologist at the Robert Koch Institute, in Berlin, came across the samples in this newest study in a stroke of luck. A couple of years ago, he decided to investigate the collections of the Berlin Museum of Medical History of the Charité. He wasn’t looking for anything in particular, but he soon stumbled upon several lung specimens from 1918, a year he of course recognized as a notable one for respiratory disease. Despite the flu pandemic’s notoriety, the virus that caused it is still poorly understood. “I thought, Well, okay, so it’s right here in front of you. Why don’t you give it a try?” he told me. Why not try to sequence influenza from these lungs? (This work is not dangerous: The chemically preserved lung specimens do not contain intact or infectious virus; sequencing picks up just fragments of the virus’s genetic material.)Calvignac-Spencer and his colleagues ultimately tested 13 lung specimens and found evidence of flu in three. One was from a 17-year-old girl who died in Munich sometime in 1918. The two others were from teenage soldiers who both died in Berlin on June 27, 1918. This work is described in a new preprint, which has not yet been peer-reviewed.The team was able to recover a complete flu-virus genome from the 17-year-old girl’s lung tissue—only the third ever found. The two other full 1918 flu genomes both came from the United States, from the lungs of a woman buried in Alaska and from a paraffin-wax-embedded lung sample of a soldier who died in New York. With another genome in hand, the researchers moved to investigate how they differed. Several changes showed up in the flu’s genome-replication machinery, a potential evolutionary hot spot because better replication means a more successful virus. The team then copied just the replication machinery of the 17-year-old’s virus—not the entire virus—into cells and found it was only half as active as that of the flu virus found in Alaska.The obvious caveats should apply here: tiny sample size, the limits of extrapolating from test tube to human body. The exact date of the girl’s death in 1918 is also unknown, but this finding hints at the possibility that the virus’s behavior did change during the pandemic. Scientists have long speculated about why the 1918 pandemic’s second wave was deadlier than the first. Patterns of human behavior and seasonality could explain some of the difference—but the virus itself might have changed too. “And this starts to put some meat on the bone” of that hypothesis, Andrew Mehle, an influenza researcher at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, who was not involved in the study, told me.The lungs of the two young soldiers in Berlin provide another clue. The teenagers’ June 1918 deaths were squarely in the pandemic’s first wave. These two samples yielded only partial genomes, but the team was able to reconstruct enough to home in on changes in nucleoprotein, one of the proteins that make up the virus’s replication machinery. Nucleoproteins act like scaffolds for the virus’s gene segments, which wind around the protein like a spiral staircase. They are also extremely distinctive, which can be a weakness: The human immune system is very good at recognizing and sabotaging them.Indeed, the 1918 flu virus’s nucleoprotein seems to have mutated between the first and second waves to better evade the human immune system. The first-wave viruses’ nucleoproteins looked a bit like those in flu viruses that infect birds—which makes sense because scientists suspect that the 1918 flu originated in birds. But bird viruses are attuned to bird bodies. “When it jumps to humans, the virus is not evolved to be optimally resistant” to the human immune system, Jesse Bloom, a virologist at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, in Seattle, told me. Bloom and others have identified specific mutations that make the nucleoprotein better at resisting the human immune system. The first-wave flu viruses did not have them, but the second-wave ones did, possibly because they had had the time to adapt to infecting humans.This mutation-by-mutation analysis of the 1918 flu virus would have been impossible to imagine at the time of the pandemic. Doctors then hadn’t even figured out that influenza was caused by a virus. “There’s no way the individual who saved these samples in 1918 had any idea of what could be done to them,” Mehle said. “To my mind, this is a beautiful example of fundamental research.” Without the pathologist who painstakingly preserved these samples and the museums that kept them for decades before science caught up, our understanding of the 1918 flu would be all the poorer.Unfortunately, many historical samples have been lost as pathology collections have fallen out of fashion over the past century. “If we had started these kinds of studies in the ’60s, we would have had no problems finding thousands and thousands of specimens,” Calvignac-Spencer said. “And now we’re really fighting to assemble a collection of 20.” He’s been in touch with more than 50 museum collections around the world in the hunt for more pandemic-flu samples. He recently found one from Australia, but the work is slow. Calvignac-Spencer has also looked for other viruses, including measles, which he and his colleagues previously found in a 100-year-old lung from the same medical collection in Berlin.The further back in time researchers must go, the harder the samples are to find—but Bloom told me he’s especially intrigued by the possibility of finding pre-1918 flu genomes in the archives. When the 1918 pandemic swept through the world, it apparently completely replaced whatever flu existed before. Its modern-day descendants continue to infect us today as seasonal flu. In this way, the 1918 flu is familiar to us and our immune systems. What came before is still a mystery.About the AuthorSarah Zhang is a staff writer at The Atlantic.More StoriesA ‘Crazy’ Idea for Treating Autoimmune Diseases Might Actually WorkAbortion Pills Have Changed the Post-Roe CalculusTrained ferrets can smell avian flu in duck p | EurekAlert!

WEEKLY. View online edition October 9, 2024 Community Calendar Classifieds Kansas, 1918 Haskell County, Kansas is where 1918 Spanish Flu likely originated. by Vince Farinaccio May 24, 2021 Cover Story, Email Cover, History Soldiers ill with Spanish influenza at Camp Funston, Kansas, 1918. The past pandemic year has been filled with speculation as to the source of Covid-19, prompting everything from conspiracy theories to assigning blame for its origins. Most global epidemics over the centuries experienced similar treatment, even if the finger-pointing lacks the accuracy and indisputable proof to certify that such conclusions are correct. But putting together the clues of such a complex origin might baffle even the best detectives. Just over a century ago the Spanish Flu devastated the globe, claiming the lives of millions around the world throughout 1918. Its title, however, promotes the notion that the origin of the epidemic occurred in Spain. It didn’t. According to various online sources, countries fighting in World War I suppressed newspaper reports about the virus in order to maintain morale. Because Spain was neutral in the war, its toll of flu cases was reported internationally and the country became forever associated with the influenza pandemic, which was also referred to as the Purple Death because of the bluish tint it left on its victims. In 2014, National Geographic laid the blame on the Chinese, its headlines stating that a historian was claiming the flu originated in China and that “Chinese laborers transported across Canada [are] thought to be [the] source.” They aren’t. According to John M. Barry on the National Center for Biotechnology Information website, “Influenza did surface in early 1918 in China, but the outbreaks were minor, did not spread, and contemporary Chinese scientists, trained by Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research… investigators, stated they believed these outbreaks were endemic disease unrelated to the pandemic.” Barry also identifies that the virus being spread by Chinese or Vietnamese laborers crossing the U.S. is merely speculation. England was another culprit or, more accurately, its Army bases. What was diagnosed as a form of bronchitis among soldiers in 1916-1917 has been hypothesized more recently as the first documentation of the 1918 influenza epidemic. It isn’t. Barry reports that Journal of Infectious Disease editor Dr. Edwin Jordan “rejected it for several reasons. The disease had flared up, true, but had not spread rapidly or widely outside the affected bases; instead, it seemed to disappear.” France and India were also suspects, but there is no evidence that the flu originated in either country. So, for anyone wishing to point a finger at a guilty party, the United States has enough clues to arouse suspicion. Two years before the Covid-19 pandemic began, The Wichita Eagle reported that “one of the world’s deadliest influenza pandemics started quietly, inconspicuously…And it was here, in Kansas…The community was most likely Santa Fe, now a ghost town in Haskell County…” The newspaper described the Santa Fe location as part of the Kansas prairie “where dirt-poor farm families struggled to do daily chores—slopping pigs, feeding cattle, horses, and chickens, living in primitive, cramped, uninsulated quarters.” Last September, Tom Levitt noted in The Guardian, “Wildlife, and our increasing proximity to wildlife, is the most common source [of pandemics], but farmed animals are not only original sources, they can be transmission sources or bridging hosts, carrying the infection from the wild to humans.” In discussing 1918 Santa Fe, Kansas, The Wichita Eagle wrote, “It’s not known whether it started in the pigs or chickens or birds flying overhead. But it spread to young farmers…” by January 1918. Those farmers and others in Haskell County were treated by the local physician, Dr. Loring Miner, who recognized the threat of the strain and published his findings in Public Health Reports, a periodical of the U.S. Public Health Service, as a warning, despite its purported disappearance by late February. Barry argues that “If the virus did not originate in Haskell, there is no good explanation for how it arrived there. There were no other known outbreaks anywhere in the United States from which someone could have carried the disease to Haskell, and no suggestions of influenza outbreaks in either newspapers or reflected in vital statistics anywhere else in the region.” By March 4, a soldier stationed at Camp Funston, 300 miles east of Haskell, was reported as having contracted influenza. The Wichita Eagle identified the base as “the largest training facility in the Army, full of makeshift non-insulated barracks, housing 250 soldiers each. It teemed with soldiers from all over the Midwest, training for duty in France.” “All Army personnel from the county reported to Funston for training,” Barry explains. “Friends and family visited them at Funston. Soldiers came home on leave, then returned to Funston.” The result was that within three weeks, 1,100 soldiers at the camp required hospitalization while thousands more appeared at infirmaries. Barry concludes that “the timing of the Funston explosion strongly suggests that the influenza outbreak there did come from Haskell.” Rather than containing it, however, soldiers showing no symptoms were transferred to other Army bases in the U.S. and in Europe. By April, according to Barry, 24 of the 36 main military camps were overrun by the epidemic. In the same timeframe, “influenza was erupting in France, first at Brest, the single largest port of disembarkation for American troops.” In the quest to understand the origins of the 1918 pandemic, a considerable amount of sleuthing over the past 100 years has gotten us to this explanation, which is still not an irrefutably proven fact. And, like the theories involving Spain, China, England, France and India, those regarding the U.S. have also had to contend with disinformation. In 2006, a Worcester, Massachusetts newspaper, The Telegram, ran an article claiming, “Fort Devens [in Massachusetts] was the U.S. Ground Zero of the flu pandemic that spread around the world in 1918, killing more people than died in World War I. In early 1918, Fort Devens was one of the main centers of the U.S. war effort. On Sept. 1, its barracks were jammed with 45,000 soldiers waiting to be shipped to France. By the end of that month, Fort Devens was a charnel house filled with the dead and dying.” This could be a fascinating historical revelation. But it isn’t.

The ferrets were 90 per cent accurate at detecting the virus, even when they were presented with poo from ducks infected with other viruses. "One of the things that is great is the instant response," said Glen Golden, who co-authored the study published today in PLOS One."You find out in one minute as opposed to getting a sample, sending it to a lab, and then getting results a couple of days later."Detecting disease, one sniff at a timeSome animals' sense of smell is so sharp that they can smell diseases long before lab tests can pick them up.Catch up on the latest COVID-19 news hereDogs, rodents, and mustelids — the family that includes weasels, otters, and ferrets — have three or more times the odour-detecting nerve cells in their brains than humans and other primates.Ferrets are behaviourally similar to dogs and also have a sharp sense of smell. (Supplied: USDA Wildlife Services)A recent UK study found that airport sniffer dogs can be trained to detect "corona odour" in people infected with coronavirus with a sensitivity of 94.3 per cent, making them handy for screening hundreds of people quickly.These dogs were even able to smell the virus when people had only mild or asymptomatic disease.Dogs have also been shown to pick up on a range of different cancers in tissue samples, including melanoma, prostate, and breast cancers.African giant pouched rats (Cricetomys gambianus) have also been successfully trained to detect tuberculosis in saliva and mucus samples from people living in Africa.A silent bird killerAvian influenza can have a devastating impact on bird populations, with Victoria seeing its worst outbreak in October last year.Ancient poo studyPhoto shows A fossilised faecesA new study has found that our gut bugs are vastly different from those that inhabited our hunter-gatherer ancestors, revealing how our switch to a more industrial lifestyle has influenced our microbiome.Over 460,000 chickens across six farms in the state were culled to help contain the outbreak. These losses can have a big ripple effect, with a 2015 bird flu outbreak in the United States costing retailers and food service industries $US3.3 billion.Halting the spread of bird flu can be tricky, as lab tests can only pick up on the disease at least two days after infection, said Dr Golden of Colorado State University, who studies how animals detect diseases through scent. But dogs can get an answer straight away. "Dogs are highly reliable in detecting avian influenza in faecal samples from infected animals on day one," Dr Golden said."It's not invasive, and you don't have to kill or sedate an animal to get an answer."Ferreting out bird flu While dogs are reliable disease detectives, they take a lot of time and money to train.But because ferrets are behaviourally similar to dogs and also have a sharp sense of smell, Dr Golden and his team wanted to see whether they could be an alternative.To find out, the researchers trained six domesticated ferrets to distinguish between poo samples from ducks infected with avian flu virus from those collected from healthy birds. The ferrets were trained to scratch the box containing the "bird flu" sample.They placed the duck poo samples in five boxes, with one box containing poo from an infected bird.Study co-author Hailey McLean prepares duck faeces samples for ferret training trials. (Supplied: USDA Wildlife Services )Over four days of trials, all six ferrets correctly identified the box with the infected sample by placing their paw on the box.Next, the researchers included a healthy poo sample that had been collected on a different day to the other samples. But the ferrets were not fazed and still correctly identified the infected poo, indicating that the time since the samples were collected didn't affect their choice.Even when the researchers included two infected poo samples, collected on different days, the ferrets still placed their paws on the correct box. And they could even do the job when infected samples had been collected from ducks from different locations, and that had eaten different diets.The last test was to see if the ferrets could sniff out "bird flu" poo from ducks also infected with the bird viruses that cause Newcastle disease and infectious laryngotracheitis.The mix of odours from the different samples didn't throw the ferrets off the scent."All six of them went to go to the next box, then spun around and slammed their paw down on the box that contains the [correct] sample," Dr Golden said."I was so amazed."Will ferrets show up at the doctor's office?While Dr Golden said ferrets could be trained to sniff out other diseases, they probably won't be showing up in the clinic anytime soon. "You couldn't use a ferret in, say, an exam room with a doctor, because they're just too distractible," he said. This is because they need to be presented with samples in a controlled environment to perform well.ABC Science on YouTubeWant more science — plus health, environment, tech and more? Subscribe to our channel.Even so, the findings confirm that dogs aren't the only animals that can be trained to sniff out diseases, said Clare Browne from the University of Waikato in New Zealand, who studies scent detection in dogs."Working with traditional scent-detection dogs involves a lot of investment in terms of care, time, and money," said Dr Browne, who was not involved in the study."If the volatile compounds of a disease can be detected by ferrets or other animals, then animal detectors could potentially be produced for that purpose with the appropriate training and testing."Posted Wed 26 May 2021 at 7:00pmWednesday 26 May 2021 at 7:00pmWed 26 May 2021 at 7:00pm, updated Thu 27 May 2021 at 6:18amThursday 27 May 2021 at 6:18amThu 27 May 2021 at 6:18amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesDonald Trump calls Vladimir Putin and urges him not to escalate Ukraine war, media reportsTopic:World PoliticsPhoto shows Close up of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in conversation Dutton is already testing Trump's campaign slogans.

It could have, though. The devastation of the ongoing second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic — desperate pleas for life-saving oxygen and critical care, tapering queues at crematoriums and burial grounds, abandoned bodies floating on the Ganga hastily buried on its banks, and an overwhelmed medical staff on the brink — puts F Norman White’s words well within the bounds of people’s imagination. White was the sanitary commissioner in British India and excerpts from his A Preliminary Report on the Influenza Pandemic of 1918 in India are cited by author Chinmay Tumbe in his book The Age of Pandemics published late last year. Tumbe’s book is without doubt one for the times, but appears prescient when read against the backdrop of the rampaging second wave of Covid-19. An assistant professor of Economics at the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, Tumbe anchors the discourse around the current pandemic by studying mass infections that hit the subcontinent in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The influenza pandemic — the Spanish flu in popular imagination — launched itself in short, deadly spurts between 1918 and 1920, and according to Tumbe’s research claimed “close to or over 20 million” lives in colonial India. Newer estimates place the death toll of the influenza worldwide between 50 million and 100 million. It erased 6.4 per cent of the population of India at the time, making it one of the deadliest health calamities in recent history.Ever since the Covid-19 pandemic hit the subcontinent early last year, the novel coronavirus has peaked and ebbed to claim over 300,000 lives in India so far. And it still rages. The month of May has been the harshest so far, often registering a daily death toll of over 4,000. India has battled one of its worst health crises since Independence in the past two months.The two pandemics — hundred years apart and separated by giant leaps in science and medicine, and altered economic and political statuses — are strikingly similar in the annihilation it left in its wake. However, the influenza pandemic of 1918, a black box of lessons and warnings for contemporary times, has remained a footnote in history. It is the year World War I ended, and little in comparison is said of the pandemic which killed more people than the Great War.Spectre of death“A similarity between what we experienced 100 years ago and what we are seeing now is that it was left entirely to the people to take care of themselves,” points out Chandrakant Lahariya, New Delhi-based epidemiologist, public policy and health systems expert.While the influenza pandemic raged in a British colony, in the intervening century India has transitioned to an independent, democratic country. “We now elect our governments. When people face challenges, the government should be able to support them. In this pandemic, people were left to fend for themselves, be it for medicine, oxygen or even securing vaccines,” Lahariya says.The hundred years in between ushered in significant changes in medical and scientific understanding. Differences between then and now are substantial: In 1918, the virus which caused the influenza was not identified; laboratory tests were not prevalent and neither were vaccines, he adds. Biological markers such as CT scans were not available. In 2020, most of those boxes are ticked. “Despite the medical advances, we’re struggling to fight the disease,” laments Lahariya, co-author of Till We Win: India’s Fight Against the Covid-19 Pandemic . Tumbe concurs. The crisis — then and now — overwhelmed governments, forcing civil society to step in. Social media transformed into a facilitator during Covid-19, patients and their caretakers found leads to hospital beds and oxygen concentrators online. A century ago, people sought help elsewhere.“During my research, I came across ‘Letters to the Editor’ in which people wrote in requesting the social service team to visit their district. They were bypassing the government, and asking for help locally,” Tumbe says.The Covid-19 pandemic has turned Facebook posts, Twitter threads and WhatsApp forwards into a timeline of unfolding health crises and virtual obituaries. However, personal accounts on the 1918 influenza are few. A poignant and oft-cited one is the memoir of Hindi poet Suryakant Tripathi ‘Nirala’. The poet lost his wife and one-year-old daughter to the pandemic. The spiral of death wiped out much of his extended family and farmhands. Pall of gloom: Bodies buried on the banks of the Ganga in the wake of a deadly second wave of Covid-19 “In whichever direction I turned, I saw darkness,” he writes in A Life Misspent , translated into English by Satti Khanna. He buries his cousin’s dead daughter on the banks of the Ganga. Soon, his uncle succumbs: “One more corpse to cart to the Ganga.” A telegram intimating him of his wife’s illness had brought the poet to Dalmau in Uttar Pradesh. “I travelled to the riverbank in Dalmau and waited. The Ganga was swollen with dead bodies,” he observes. Nirala’s woes find mention in Paris-based British journalist and science writer Laura Spinney’s article and book Pale Rider: The Spanish flu of 1918 and how it changed the world . “The imagery is shockingly similar at the moment. ‘Nirala’ could be speaking of today,” Spinney tells BL ink . Familial loses were widespread. MK Gandhi, for instance, lost his daughter-in-law and grandson to the pandemic. Both Spinney and Tumbe put forward the argument that the pandemic played a part in consolidating Gandhi’s stature as a mass leader.“Grassroot networks were mobilised during the pandemic. It is interesting to see how pandemics affect social movements that are underway,” Spinney says. Gandhi really came to the fore in 1918-19, adds Tumbe. The massacre of Jallianwala Bagh in 1919 was the tipping point, but the seeds of discontent could have been sown earlier, by the pandemic that killed millions.Influenza of 1918The influenza pandemic hit India in two predominant waves. The first was between April and June, 1918, and the deadlier second wave between August and December that year. World War I had just ended. Indian troops were returning home. Parts of India were battling drought.“It really exploded in India in the middle of September. The entire wave just takes a month or so, but in that one month it could take millions of lives back then,” Tumbe says.The pandemic decimated the Indian population, though the British rulers largely remained inured to it. “The best way to characterise the official British response to the 1918 pandemic in India is disorganised at best, negligent at worst, and in either case entirely focused on the wrong problem,” points out Maura Chhun, faculty at the department of History at the Metropolitan State University in Minnesota, US.Chhun’s doctoral thesis studies the influenza pandemic in India and the official British response to it. The monsoons had failed that summer, and the British were bracing for a famine. The feared “massive, widespread starvation” did not happen, but prices of essentials shot up, leaving the vulnerable malnourished when the deadly virus struck.“Many British doctors noted a clear link between malnutrition and high death rates from influenza. This did not stop British officials from claiming victory in the case of the famine, however,” Chhun says.The pandemic spurred little discussion among the high-ranking British officials, she notes. They were focused on the impending famine or the war in Europe. While the British doctors in India wrote in contemporary journals about treatments, theories and even vaccines, it did not evolve into a coherent public health response. The crisis, Chhun says, hardly pushed forward any meaningful ramp up of the health system.“The death rates for Europeans in India were relatively low overall, so to most of them it was almost certainly a distant problem,” she observes.Lessons for futureThe deadliest health crisis in 20th century India, however, quietly disappeared from public memory. “There appears to be something about pandemics that makes them forgettable,” Spinney notes.A revisit, though, to the forgotten chapter was necessitated by the novel coronavirus. And in that experience, author Tumbe points out, lie clues that should have aided in managing the current crisis better. He talks of the complacency that had set in after the first wave of Covid-19 in India. The lull that followed should instead have set off alarm bells.“Be it cholera, plague and influenza, no pandemic has just come and gone. It has stayed for a few years and the first lesson from the flu of 1918 is that it comes in waves. India experienced two waves; the first was mild,” he says.The argument that a second Coivid-19 wave could not have been anticipated doesn’t hold. “History lesson out there says it could be,” he adds.Pandemics hit in waves, and they could be steep, sudden and devastating, throwing life out of gear — another takeaway from 1918. Tumbe draws a parallel between the second waves of the influenza and Covid-19. “The 1918 experience tells you that between the first and second wave things can go completely haywire and very quickly, within a week cases can shoot up exponentially. If only we had paid more attention to the 1918 pattern … it is amazing how closely the Covid-19 pattern resembles the 1918 one.”The influenza pandemic had devastated rural India. Though Covid-19, in its early days, was largely dubbed an urban illness, it changed with the second wave when the virus made deep inroads into the countryside. Health infrastructure in rural areas is typically weaker.“The 1918 experience showed us that if a pandemic really gets to rural India, then you’re gone. You don’t know the extent of the crisis at the tehsil and district levels,” Tumbe notes. After a virus works itself into the rural landscape, discerning its impact takes longer. “We will get to know in a few years the toll of this pandemic and a huge chunk of that is going to be rural India… The numbers are not showing that yet,” warns Tumbe.The death toll of the influenza pandemic left deep economic scars too. The peak mortality was in the age group of 20-40 years, which wiped out a considerable part of the workforce.“India’s biggest supply shock was in 1918. GDP growth was minus 10 per cent, and inflation at about 30 per cent per annum. India was an agrarian economy at the time; prices went up partly because of the drought and partly as there were nobody to work the fields,” Tumbe observes.However, the impact of Covid-19 on the economy may be muted, he believes. “There will be some inflationary pressures. Farmers may be affected in two ways: One, a direct impact of deaths means a part of the labour force vanishes. Secondly, they will stay out of the labour force to grieve.”Covid-19 misstepsEpidemiologist Lahariya narrows down the sheer scale of Covid-19 infections in India to people’s refusal to learn from 1918 and other epidemics. “If we had, the outcomes would have been very different.” Countries that have learned from the past have worked to strengthen their public healthcare systems, he notes. Primary care: Only a robust public healthcare system can fight a pandemic, experts stress Fighting a pandemic is impossible without a robust public healthcare system, the experts stress. Lahariya draws attention to Nobel Prize-winning economist Angus Deaton’s The Great Escape where he analyses the economic and social development of European countries against the backdrop of their investment in health. “Those countries too have struggled with Covid-19. But their struggles were different from ours. They could manage it,” Lahariya says. The efficacy of India’s future pandemic battles will be dictated by its attention to healthcare. The policy and health expert calls for nodal centres at district levels to track epidemics and pandemics.Emerging viruses, he adds, are a reality. “This is not the first virus we’ve tackled; we’ve had chikungunya, dengue, Ebola, acute encephalitis syndrome and others. Yet, there isn’t enough investment on public health areas of surveillance, laboratory testing, human resources, or even epidemiology units at the district level. These are basic requirements while tackling diseases,” he points out. States with better public healthcare systems have fared better than those without in the fight against Covid-19, Lahariya observes.A recent petition filed in the Supreme Court urged that India’s vaccine PSUs, instrumental in keeping epidemics and pandemics in check, be revived. The units were meant to ensure self-sufficiency in vaccine production, but their numbers have drastically dwindled in recent decades.A new virus is always a challenge. “But the idea of a health service is to minimise its effect. The key difference between India and the other countries is that, in our case, the impact has not been minimised, rather we are under-counting numbers and showing that as a success,” Lahariya adds.The learning, he stresses, need not be from a pandemic a hundred years ago. States could learn from the successes and failures of each other while battling the same pandemic. “Parts of the country experienced oxygen shortage in April. Yet, weeks later, Goa reports oxygen scarcity and, even deaths, allegedly due to the shortage. It shows that we don’t learn from contemporary challenges even,” he rues.Way aheadAuthor-journalist Spinney has studied the 1918 influenza closely for her book and reported extensively on the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. She puts the nature of pandemics in perspective. “As soon as the health system is overwhelmed, one gets to see the same phenomena — queues [at hospitals], people developing complications that otherwise could have been avoided, and the problem of disposing of the dead. Once you get to that saturation point, the consequences are, at the general level, predictable.”Though the imagery of suffering evoked by the two pandemics are similar, Spinney is careful to point out differences. “Even if the three million plus Covid-19 deaths in the world turn out to be an underestimation, as it is most likely to be, we are not in the same ballpark when the dead were between 50-100 million people.”Spinney believes lessons have been learnt from past experiences and draws attention to the quick responses to Covid-19 world over. The pathogens were identified within weeks of its emergence, sequencing of the genome happened weeks after that, and vaccines rolled before the year was out. “We do learn. Perhaps we could argue that we don’t learn fast enough or completely enough.”Managing a pandemic, she observes, is a marathon, not a sprint. “Rare is a country that has scored well all along.”Spinney, however, underscores the parameters by which a country’s response to a pandemic can be judged. Countries that have done well are those which have taken it very seriously from the beginning. “Their efforts have been full scale and absolutely transparent. They shared information and mobilised people at every level in the community. That is clearly the right thing. Where countries have not done that or been slow to react or hidden information then that is criticisable,” she adds.The novel coronavirus has not run its course as yet. And whenever it is done, a chief takeaway could be keeping the collective memory of it alive. It is the first pandemic to hit after the internet revolution, and there’s a surfeit of pandemic reminders — virtual and elsewhere.Will that be enough to keep Covid-19 from slipping out of collective consciousness? Or will it go the influenza way, forgotten until the next pandemic?“Despite the digital footprints we’re leaving behind, it’s completely possible that in 2120, India will see a pandemic the way we have seen this one,” warns Chinmay Tumbe. He suggests systematic documentation of this crisis — books, reports et al — to ensure it doesn’t disappear from collective memory. “We need a non-partisan government committee to look at what happened,” he says.Historically, Spinney points out, societies have bounced back from a pandemic quicker than, say, a war. “Wars destroy infrastructure as well as people. Pandemics destroy ‘just’ people. People bounce back,” she adds.But questions remain. “How do we keep ourselves more protected from future pandemics, make health systems more robust and societies less unequal. The pandemic is a reminder to get things right,” Spinney says.And it begins by not forgetting. “If we were to remember it better,” she adds, “we would be more prepared for the next.” Comments SHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on May 27, 2021 Related Topics health You might also likeYou might also likeThe Hindu Businessline About Us Archive Newsletter Rss Feeds Contact us Newsroom Customer care Advertisement Careers Group News Sites The Hindu BL on Campus Sportstar Business Line இந்து தமிழ் திசை The Hindu Centre Frontline Young World Club The Hindu ePaper Business Line ePaper Crossword + Free Games Other Products RoofandFloor STEP Images Classifieds - Print Special Publications eBooks Popular Sections Companies Markets Economy Specials Portfolio Resources Company Index Home Loan Interest Rate Fixed Deposit Interest Rate Income Tax Calculator 2024-2025 NSE Holidays BSE Holidays Bank Holidays Age Calculator Gold rate today Silver rate today Nifty 50 Sensex Trending on businessline Stock Market Live Swiggy IPO Live RBI Monetary Policy Live Hyundai Share Price Live Ratan Tata Stocks Live RBI MPC Meeting Highlights Budget 2024 Highlights Reliance Share Price Adani Enterprises Share Price Nifty Prediction Today Find Voter ID Number Online SBI Share Price Tata Motors Share Price Stock Recommendation Today Top Gainers Today Top Losers Today Stock Market News Business News Market News NSE Nifty 50 BSE Sensex Trending on Group sites India Vs New Zealand Live Score Explore Frontline Packages Cricket News Paralympics 2024 Elections 2024 Electoral Bonds Full Data PM Modi oath ceremony LIVE updates Frontline Current Issue Indian Premier League IPL 2024 Euro 2024 Election 2024 Centre is diluting federalism Football News Politics News The Nation News Paris Olympics 2024 India Cricket News FL Interviews Israel-Palestine conflict Did Periyar call for a genocide of Brahmins?

We propose a new real-time influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance system that utilizes a nationwide prospective drug utilization monitoring in Korea. We defined ILI-related claims as outpatient claims that contain both antipyretic and antitussive agents and calculated the weekly rate of ILI-related claims, which was compared to weekly ILI rates from clinical sentinel surveillance data during 2014–2018. We performed a cross-correlation analysis using Pearson’s correlation, time-series analysis to explore actual correlations after removing any dubious correlations due to underlying non-stationarity in both data sets. We used the moving epidemic method (MEM) to estimate an absolute threshold to designate potential influenza epidemics for the weeks with incidence rates above the threshold. We observed a strong correlation between the two surveillance systems each season. The absolute thresholds for the 4-years were 84.64 and 86.19 cases per 1000claims for claims data and 12.27 and 16.82 per 1000 patients for sentinel data. The epidemic patterns were more similar in the 2016–2017 and 2017–2018 seasons than the 2014–2015 and 2015–2016 seasons. ILI claims data can be loaded to a drug utilization review system in Korea to make an influenza surveillance system.

Therefore, we need a national surveillance system to monitor and respond to an influenza epidemic. In Korea, such a system is currently based on a clinical sentinel surveillance system, a laboratory sentinel surveillance system, and a hospitalization and mortality monitoring system, all of which use information collected from a restricted number of selected outpatient clinics3,4. This traditional influenza surveillance system is considered the gold standard for relevant studies and public interventions5,6,7. The clinical sentinel surveillance system reports the proportion of influenza-like illness (ILI) visits among weekly outpatients through the voluntary participation of 200 local clinics nationwide. This system has been well used in Korea for a long time8. However, due to the small number of participating clinics in each region, calculating the ILI rate by region or age is limited. In addition, as pediatric clinics account for half of the 200 surveillance clinics8, it is possible that the entire epidemiology cannot be sufficiently reflected. As the surveillance system relies on voluntary reporting, there is a concern of under-reporting. Also, the degree of under-reporting may differ depending on the characteristics of the clinic because case reporting can be affected by the patient volume and the physician’s compliance9. Patient visit, data submission, analysis of weekly ILI rates and public announcement take one to two weeks5, and such a time lag from actual peak to alarm is inevitable. The external validity of these reports has not been determined. Such caveats are widely recognized globally, and an alternative system using prescription drug sales10,11, emergency department use12, or school absenteeism data13 has been proposed. More recently, research has attempted to predict the incidence of ILI in real-time using novel data from Google or other social media14,15, Wikipedia logs16,17, Twitter18, or a combination of multiple data sources19. These methods are limited in their generalization to other regions20, and may still have instabilities, such as overestimation21. Koreans need a timely and valid surveillance system to complement the sentinel surveillance system5.We sought to develop a simpler and faster surveillance system using real-time prospective drug utilization system in Korea. There is only one public health insurer in South Korea, and all Koreans and legally-residing foreigners are mandatory beneficiaries and all medical institutions (including pharmacies) are compulsory providers. Therefore, the single-payer National Health Insurance (NHI) system of Korea allows national and regional level research of healthcare service use for the entire population or representative samples in Korea. Given the comprehensive coverage of insurance under the NHI, the access barrier to healthcare service use is relatively low and thus sample selection is less of a concern. The Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA) in Korea operates a drug utilization review (DUR) system that monitors the prescribing and dispensing of drugs nation-wide and in real-time. Therefore, by monitoring the rate of drug prescriptions related to ILI, we can capture the ILI status by country-wide and sub-regional in real time. To prove this, we defined ILI-related prescription claims, calculated the rate of the ILI-related claims among the total claims, and assessed its association with the existing clinical sentinel surveillance system.ResultsWe collected a total of 208 weeks of ILI data from Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) and outpatient claims data from the NHI system from 2014 to 2018. The epidemic peak in the ILI data was observed in the 8th week (45.5 ILI visits per 1000 patients) in the 2014–2015 season, the 7th week (53.8 ILI visits per 1000 patients) in the 2015–2016 season, the 52nd week (86.2 ILI visits per 1000 patients) in the 2016–2017 season, and the 1st week (72.1 ILI visits per 1000 patients) in the 2017–2018 season. There was a total of 109,214,840 NHI outpatient claims during the 2014–2018 period. The proportions of ILI-related claims to the total outpatient claims were 6.2%, 5.9%, 6.4%, 6.1%, and 6.4% in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. Those claims were arranged weekly as the 36th week of the previous year to the 35th week of the years 2014–2015, 2015–2016, 2016–2017, and 2017–2018. Approximately 21–22 million claims were included in each season. Similar to the sentinel surveillance data, the epidemic peak in the ILI data was observed in the 8th week in the 2014–2015 season, the 7th week in the 2015–2016 season, the 52nd week in the 2016–2017 season, and the 1st week in the 2017–2018 season (Fig. 1).Figure 1Defining ILI-related claims.Full size imageFigure 2 shows the relationship between the ILI-related claims rate and the reported ILI rate from the KCDC data.

For the 50–64-year-old age group, the incidence rates peaked at week 8 in the 2014–2015 season and week 7 in the 2015–2016 season (42.4 cases per 1000 patients in the 2014–2015 season and 33.1 cases per 1000 patients in the 2015–2016 season for KCDC data, and 106.9 claims per 1000 claims in the 2014–2105 season and 118 claims per 1000 claims in the 2015–2016 season for NHI claims data). The correlations were statistically significant for all other age groups, with the correlation coefficients ranging from 0.5529 to 0.7732 across seasons (Table 1).Table 1 Comparison of the weekly ILI-related claims rate and clinical sentinel surveillance report, 2014–2016.Full size tableFigure 3 shows the ILI trends according to age group during the 2014–2016 seasons. In most weeks and age groups, the ILI-related claims rates were higher than the KCDC reported ILI rates. In individuals under six years of age, there was a more pronounced fluctuation in the KCDC rate than the ILI-related claims rate. Conversely, in those aged 65 years and older, the ILI-related claims rate showed significant fluctuation compared to the KCDC rates.Figure 3Comparison of the ILI-related claims rate and clinical sentinel surveillance report by age group, 2014–2016.Full size imageWe examined the partial autocorrelation function for sentinel and claims surveillance data, respectively, which showed a statistically significant autocorrelation at the 5% level for a lag of one week for the sentinel data and a lag of two weeks for the claims data (results not shown). The augmented Dickey-Fuller test for the null hypothesis of the unit root process (i.e., non-stationarity) was not rejected at the 5% level for either data, i.e., there was no statistically significant persistent time series, and differencing was not applied. We applied the autoregressive function for respective lags for each dataset and examined the cross-correlation coefficients between the two datasets. The residuals for the correlations were approximately normally distributed (results not shown). Figure 4 shows the cross-correlations between the residuals of the first-order (sentinel data) or the second-order (claims data) autoregressive function of each data, representing a gradual decrease in the correlation coefficients for lags greater than zero. These results indicate that the claims data neither lead nor lag the sentinel data.Figure 4Cross-correlation between the KCDC sentinel ILI rates and National Health Insurance claims ILI rates.Full size imageFigure 5 and Supplementary Fig. 1 show the MEM analysis results. The absolute thresholds for the four-year surveillance period (2014–2018) were 84.64 and 86.19 claims per 1,000 claims for the claims data and 12.27 and 16.82 per 1000 patients for the sentinel data (Supplementary Fig. 1). Both the claims and sentinel data surpassed the respective epidemic threshold in each of the four seasons. The epidemic was relatively longer in the sentinel data than the claims data, and the epidemic peaked in the claims data one to two weeks later than in the sentinel data. The epidemic pattern showed greater similarity in terms of the peak during the epidemic period in the 2016–2017 and 2017–2018 seasons than the 2014–2015 and 2015–2016 seasons (Fig. 5).Figure 5Epidemic thresholds for the surveillance of ILI rates from the KCDC sentinel data and National Health Insurance claims data.Full size imageDiscussionThe influenza surveillance system of Korea is operated by the KCDC and consists of the three systems; clinical sentinel surveillance, laboratory sentinel surveillance, and an influenza hospitalization and mortality surveillance system3,4. Among them, the clinical sentinel surveillance system began operation on a pilot basis in 1997 with more than 70 private medical institutions. In 2000, the system was expanded to the Korea Influenza Surveillance Scheme, which consists of a clinical and a laboratory monitoring system involving public health centers and private medical institutions. In 2008, the public health center's zero reporting rate was high, even during the influenza epidemic, so the public health center was replaced with a private medical institution to secure more reliable data. In 2009, the number of monitoring agencies was expanded, but there was still a limit to the number of zero reporting sites even during an epidemic period. During expert meetings held in 2013, 200 clinical surveillance institutions were designated as active participants, 36 of which were invited to participate in a laboratory sentinel surveillance system. Currently, the clinical sentinel surveillance involves the selection of 200 outpatient clinics, designated by a medical association, including 100 pediatric clinics and 100 internal or family medicine clinics with specialties in internal medicine, pediatrics, and family medicine.8 Site selection is based on geographical distribution and population characteristics (Supplementary Table 3)22. The number of ILI patients and the total number of outpatients should be reported weekly from April to November of the current year and daily from December to April of the following year. After collecting each clinic’s data, KCDC releases the proportion of ILI visits per 1000 patients per week each week.However, one disadvantage to such a surveillance system is that a one to two-week reporting lag is inevitable. Considering the potential mismatch of influenza vaccines and circulating virus strains and the limited capacity to prevent an influenza epidemic in advance23, it is essential to control an epidemic promptly5. Such a sentinel alert system is also time and labor-intensive: a network of 400 outpatient providers across Korea submit ILI counts, which are then summarized by the KCDC8. Also, reports may not always reflect the trends across the country5,24, as participation is voluntary8 and results are from conveniently selected sample clinics8. This can lead to under-reporting, especially early in the season, when both doctors and the general population are unaware of an influenza outbreak. Several weeks may pass between the actual onset of a seasonal epidemic and the official alert. As reporting can be affected by the patient volume and the physician’s compliance9, the amount of under-reporting varies from clinic to clinic.Therefore, new surveillance systems attempt to overcome these shortcomings and detect early influenza signals14,15,19,25,26,27,28,29,30. Google Flu Trends was a web service that predicted an influenza epidemic based on 45 queries14. Although initial reports had a 97% accuracy compared to the United States Center for Disease Control data31, subsequent reports revealed Google Flu Trends to be inaccurate21. The errors in Google Flu Trends may have been due to media-stoked panic and the fact that people making flu-related searches may not have symptoms, but were researching other disease symptoms similar to influenza21. Other social media platforms, such as Twitter, have made efforts to remove unrelated messages to improve programme accuracy18. Regardless, searches on Google, Wikipedia, or social media are likely to vary from country to country30. The coverage even within a country varies, as rural areas with older populations are likely to have low access to social media18 and are thus systematically underrepresented. External validation of algorithms using this data is questionable.ILI does not have a diagnostic code that is adequately responsive. By contrast, drug prescription data are reliable because they reflect the doctor’s judgment regarding the patient’s condition. Therefore, claims with antiviral agents for influenza can be used for surveillance, which is likely to detect confirmed influenza cases. Claims data, including prescription records, are valid as the patient’s subjective symptoms are confirmed by the prescribing physician. A surveillance system based on claims data can predict influenza epidemics more efficiently and reliably than internet search engines or a self-report system, without any additional data collection. The national health insurance system in South Korea is particularly useful for complementary influenza surveillance given that the claims data represents healthcare service use for the entire population, and most of the services are reimbursed.There may be a time lag between the actual practice and the reimbursement claim. Therefore, we propose applying this study’s concepts to the nationwide Drug Utilization Review (DUR) system in South Korea. DUR is operated by the HIRA, which has all of the reimbursement claims data for review and assessment. The DUR system detects potential side effects and unsafe use at the time of prescribing and dispensing the medications, providing patient records of drug use and real-time alerts32. In this system, a physician’s prescription is cross-checked by the HIRA using a specialized database that can warn doctors via their computer screen in real-time (Supplementary Fig. 2). The doctor may then change the prescription or note the reason they are keeping it as is. The final decision will be sent to HIRA. Pharmacists will follow the same process. A warning message on the DUR system prompts the pharmacist to follow-up with the doctor before dispensing the medication. Final dispensing details are sent to the HIRA. This process is completed within 0.5 s. All providers in Korea have access to the DUR system and send prescription and dispensing details to the HIRA. Therefore, ILI surveillance can be performed in real-time by adding an indicator for ILI-related claims in the DUR system.The proposed alert system is similar to a real-time alert system for influenza epidemics in other countries, including Japan and Taiwan5,24. Taiwan’s system proactively sends an alert to subscribers via a mobile application or computerized physician order entry when one of the three surveillance systems, based on the sentinel reports, insurance claims, or the electronic medical records of selected hospitals, presents incidence values over the epidemic threshold5. However, planting the surveillance system in the prospective DUR is a more novel and efficient manner of capturing and controlling the emerging surveillance alert given that it is based on the compulsory participation of all pharmacies and clinicians in a nation. This ensures that all healthcare providers are subscribers and the government is already part of the system.There are several limitations in this study. First, we did not compare ILI claims rates with laboratory-confirmed influenza cases. The ILI rates do not represent true cases of influenza. ILI has a low sensitivity (30–70%) for predicting laboratory confirmed influenza33,34. Patients who were diagnosed with laboratory confirmed influenza are prescribed antiviral agents, but not everyone is prescribed antiviral agents. Moreover, some antiviral agents are not covered by insurance. Therefore, all confirmed influenza cases are not detected by claims data alone, and laboratory data is required to ensure that influenza-specific policies are initiated. We also acknowledge that monitoring ILI-related prescription claims does not provide information about the virus or disease severity and cannot replace the entire influenza surveillance system. The system suggested in this study cannot replace all of the traditional influenza surveillance systems, and the need for laboratory or hospitalization and mortality surveillance still exists. Regardless, this may complement the traditional clinical sentinel surveillance to provide quicker and easier data collection and analysis5. Second, national health insurance in Korea is a single-payer program, and has an electronic prescription monitoring system that streamline real-time data collection and reporting. Therefore, implementation of this scheme is limited in other countries with other health insurance systems. Third, physicians may avoid prescribing antitussive agents despite the patient’s symptoms. This trend is expected to occur in young children, because it is recommended to use antitussive agents more carefully in younger children due to concerns about side effects35. In conclusion, the weekly fraction of outpatient claims having both antipyretic and antitussive agents among the total claims were similar to the existing sentinel ILI surveillance system. This suggests that it is possible to integrate a new, real-time influenza surveillance system to the existing system for efficient and timely surveillance.MethodsData sourceWe used the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service-National Patient Samples (HIRA-NPS), 2014–2018, to identify ILI-related insurance claims. The HIRA-NPS is a stratified random sample of 3% of the Korean population that includes approximately 1.4 million individuals. Because the HIRA-NPS extracts data from the National Health Insurance System (NHIS), it only includes data on claims that are reimbursed by the NHIS36.National weekly ILI rates were pulled from public data provided by the Korea Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (KCDC)37. The selected sites for the clinical sentinel surveillance system report the number of ILI patients and the number of outpatients. Based on this report, KCDC releases the weekly incidence of ILI per 1000 patients.To reinforce personal information protection, HIRA has revised the principle of providing data for research from 2017. They offered only the age group instead of the exact age, and the age groups of KCDC and HIRA were different. Therefore, only data prior to 2017 was used for comparison by age group.Operational definition of ILIILI is defined as an acute respiratory illness with a measured temperature of 38.0 °C or higher and a cough with onset within the last 10 days38. For sentinel surveillance, ILI is defined as the sudden onset of fever (> 38.0 °C) with cough or sore throat39. The ILI rate, calculated using the total number of weekly outpatient patients as the denominator and the number of weekly patients with ILI as the numerator, is reported as the number of ILI patients per 1000 outpatients per week.We defined an influenza-like illness (ILI)-related claim as an outpatient claim that contains both antipyretic and antitussive agents (Supplementary Table 1, 2). The ILI-related claims rate was defined as the proportion of ILI-related claims of the entire outpatient claims for a given period. We used the following process to define an ILI-related claim (Fig. 1): (1) we pulled outpatient claims; (2) we identified those outpatient claims with both antipyretic and antitussive agents (ILI-related claims, hereafter); (3) we reorganized claims weekly, like the clinical sentinel surveillance data issued by the KCDC; and (4) the ILI-related claims rate was calculated as the weekly number of ILI-related claims per 1000 outpatient claims per week.Statistical analysisWe first performed a cross-correlation analysis using Pearson’s correlation to compare ILI-related claims rates and weekly ILI rates from the KCDC’s clinical sentinel surveillance data. We then used a time-series analysis to examine the autocorrelation in both surveillance data to explore actual correlations after removing any dubious correlations due to underlying non-stationarity in both data sets. We performed the partial autocorrelation function for all lags and the augmented Dickey-Fuller test for the null hypothesis of the unit root process (i.e., non-stationarity)40,41. We then generated cross-correlation coefficients for residuals after controlling for any autocorrelation properties. Lastly, we used the moving epidemic method (MEM) to estimate an absolute threshold from historical influenza incidence data and to designate potential influenza epidemics for the weeks with incidence rates above the threshold42,43. We estimated the absolute threshold for the sentinel data and insurance claims data, respectively, using the MEM, and compared the epidemic period and whether the peak in the epidemic period is visually overlapped for each data set. Data were analyzed weekly over 12 months for the entire study duration and separately by each surveillance period starting from the 36th week of a calendar year to the 35th week of the following calendar year.Data analysis was performed using SAS software, version 9.4 (Cary, NC), Stata software version 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA, https://www.stata.com/stata14/), and R 3.4.2 (CRAN) using the MEM library version 2.1144.Ethical statementThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Yonsei University (approval number: 201905-h-1535-01) and Korea University Ansan Hospital (approval number: 2019AS0107).

Most commonly found in the places where microbes love to take root - mucous membranes of the eye, mouth, nose and lungs - they're known to kill all sorts of tiny invaders, such as viruses, bacteria and fungi. Given their power, one might think peptides would represent promising drug treatments, perhaps even a cure, for many infectious diseases. But, alas, they are fundamentally flawed: They are vulnerable to a myriad of enzymes whose job is to rapidly break them down in a way that robs them of their therapeutic properties. Because of their vulnerability to enzymatic breakdown, peptides are not ideal drugs. They're expensive to produce, and yet they must be given in large doses because they disintegrate so quickly." Annelise Barron, Associate Professor of Bioengineering, Stanford School of Engineering But, as Barron describes in the journal Pharmaceuticals, she and a team of collaborators have now created peptide-like molecules - which she calls "peptoids" - that could circumvent peptides' shortcomings and turn these new molecules into the basis for an emerging category of antiviral drugs that could treat everything from herpes and COVID-19 to the common cold. Although Barron cautions that years of development and testing remain before these peptoid-based drugs will make it to market, results to date are extremely encouraging. A better backbone Peptoids are among a class of biochemicals known as "biomimetics" - molecules that mimic the behavior of biological molecules, but with certain key advantages. Their real-world counterparts, the peptides, are composed of series of bioactive amino acids, known as side chains, bonded in a specific sequence to a long-chain scaffold, known as the peptide backbone. The result is a little like a biomolecular charm bracelet. Unfortunately, the bonds that hold the all-important charms in place are too easily dissolved in the body by the enzymes known as proteases, which digest proteins. When peptides dissolve, their powers vanish. Peptoids, however, are engineered for durability. Their strength derives from their structure, which is like, and yet fundamentally different from, that of peptides. By altering the underlying backbone and strengthening the bonds that hold the charms in place, Barron's team has created a way for these antiviral agents to retain the powers that peptides lose when they are degraded by proteases. "We are excited that our peptoids show great potential as novel antivirals," Barron said. Upside potential In their study, Barron and team chose to focus on the herpes virus, which is most notable for causing cold sores around the mouth, sexually transmitted infections and even certain forms of blindness. If contracted later in life, herpes can be particularly devastating to its host. Herpes virus brain infections also are associated with Alzheimer's disease, an active area of research.

Based on preliminary experiments, they narrowed these to 10 promising candidates, which her team synthesized. Barron then worked with professor Gill Diamond (University of Louisville) to test her newly minted molecules not just for their effectiveness against the herpes virus, but also for their effect on healthy human cells from the exterior surface of the mouth - known as the oral epithelium. As expected, some of the peptoids showed no effect against the virus. Others were active, but harmful to healthy host cells. But a precious handful of five peptoids proved worthy of additional study. In the end, two hit the sweet spot - defanging the herpes virus while not harming epithelial cells. One of the candidates, in fact, showed "complete" effectiveness against the virus, and that has Barron excited about the possibilities for treating herpes and, perhaps, beyond. Bursting the bubble The peptoids work by disrupting the virus's encapsulating outer membrane. This protective bubble is key to any virus's ability to insinuate itself into healthy tissues and distribute its harmful DNA into human cells, leading to infection. "Peptoids destroy the membranes, not just of herpes but other viruses as well. This should give them wide applicability, perhaps even against certain deadly viral infections that currently have no cure," Barron said. Barron has since sent samples of peptoids to infectious disease labs around the world asking them to test these new structures against a host of virulent strains, most notably the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19, but also more familiar viruses like influenza and rhinovirus, the culprit behind the common cold. "The early reports from my collaborators are very encouraging," Barron said. "Because our peptoids mimic a very specific human broad-spectrum antiviral peptide - cathelicidin LL-37 - we weren't surprised that they work, but still absolutely delighted to see these results coming in from all around the world."

At a virtual meeting held on Sunday, doctors from both expert groups told chief minister Uddhav Thackeray that administering the influenza vaccine would help curb the incidence of this disease, which in turn will help decongest hospitals and prevent unnecessary testing since the signs of seasonal flu can mimic Covid-19.Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP) recommends the influenza vaccine for children below the age of five. The vaccine, that contains two subtypes of influenza A and two lineages of influenza B, is widely available in the private market, but it is not a part of the vaccines given under the national immunisation programme. It costs Rs 1,500-Rs2,000 for a single shot.Dr Sanjay Oak, chairman of the state Covid taskforce, told the CM, âWe are of the opinion that the influenza vaccine should be advised proactively. Since itâs expensive, it is mostly the middle class and upper class that can afford it. At the state level, we may think of reducing the cost or giving it to every child at least in the next six months.â Dr Suhas Prabhu, who heads the paediatric taskforce, said flu patients may present Covid-like symptoms. âIf they all start coming to hospitals and if RT-PCR has to be done for all, there will be added expenses and crowding in hospitals,â he said. He told the CM at least for this year, the state may make an exception and give the vaccine to all children.CM Thackeray said the state will certainly consider the suggestion. âHowever, we need more clarity on whether asymptomatic Covid positive child can take the vaccine. Vaccination is not at all an issue but how, when and whom to vaccinate should be clear to avoid further complications,â said Thackeray. Meanwhile, members from both taskforces said children who may have missed out on their routine immunisation doses due to a Covid infection should complete their schedule. âIt is safe for a child to get BCG, rubella or any vaccine that they may have missed out on if four weeks have passed since the onset of Covid symptoms,â said Dr Vijay Yewale, also a member of the paediatric taskforce.

This question is probably currently in every spirit lover’s mind, as nowadays it is suggested to stay away from alcohol as it acts as an immunosuppressant. But do you know that in 1918 whiskey was prescribed by medical experts themselves when the deadliest pandemic of its time hit the whole world?Spanish flu is said to be the mother of all pandemics as it swiped away 3-5% of the world’s population. It is estimated that between 1918 and 1920, 50-100 million people lost their lives.2/7​Whiskey: A medicineAs Spanish flu seeped deep into the United States of America, people restored to their old school remedy; whiskey. It was recommended in small quantities and was said to have medicinal benefits. Doctors, nurses and frontline workers regularly used whiskey to safeguard themselves from influenza. Some physicians believed whiskey helped stimulate the heart and respiratory system that are weakened by illness, while others thought that its sedating effect brought some comfort to the patients.Since there were no antibiotics available in 1918, a range of treatments from aspirin and strychnine to Horlicks, Vicks Vaporub and whiskey were used to treat patients. 3/7​TOI in 1919According to an article published in The Times of India newspaper on April 4, 1919, whiskey not only acted as a stimulant but a sedative too.The article said, “The demand for an increased issue of whisky emanates from those who would use sickness and death rate as an additional argument in favour of a relaxation. If whisky’s sale is permitted, it is certain that much of it will be consumed for other than purely therapeutic purposes. Whiskey is not only a stimulant but a sedative too. It induces a sense of well-being and freedom from anxiety, which is certainly a help in resisting infection.” 4/7​Increased sale of whiskeyA liquor dealer in Syracuse was quoted in a 1918 newspaper report: “We have sold more than three times the amount of whiskey since the epidemic began. They take it with yeast cakes, with soda, with quinine and with a dozen other things, and some take it straight. Some of our customers say physicians have advised the use of whiskey and others say their friends have used it with good results. Even people who have never drunk whiskey in their life are taking it now.”5/7​Treatment during Spanish fluUS Navy nurse Josie Mabel Brown recalled serving in 1918 at the Naval Station Great Lakes near Chicago and said, “There were so many patients we didn’t have time to treat them. We didn’t take temperatures; we didn’t even have time to take blood pressure. We would give them a little hot whiskey toddy; that’s about all we had time to do. They would have terrific nosebleeds with it. Some were delirious and some had their lungs punctured. Then their bodies would fill with air. You would see them with bubbles all through their arms. Oh, it was a horrid thing. We had to wear operating masks and gowns all the time. It was 16 hours a day until the epidemic was over. I suppose no one knows how many died. They just lost track of them.”6/7Can whiskey be used as a medicine?There was no scientific backing behind whiskey as medicine during the Spanish flu. It was widely prescribed by doctors only because it acted as a sedative and provided some relief from the illness by inducing an intoxicating effect. There is no connection between whiskey and the medicinal benefits it provides to the patient. In 1917, even the American Medical Association said that alcohol itself was of no medicinal value. In today's time, if you notice COVID related symptoms, it is best not to self-medicate as it can worsen the symptoms and invite more trouble. 7/7​BottomlineThe times have changed. We have more medicines now and much more research has already been done about the efficacy of alcohol as a pain killer or cure than was done in the time of Spanish flu. It is a known fact that binge drinking and excessive consumption of whiskey weakens the immune system. On the other hand, mixing alcohol and painkillers can cause stomach ulcers and bleeding, which can worsen your illness and slow down the recovery.It is advised to avoid alcohol during times like these when COVID-19 has grappled the whole world.

The vaccine costs Rs 1,500-Rs2,000 for a single shot. Representative image MUMBAI: The state Covid taskforce and the newly constituted paediatric taskforce have jointly appealed to the state government to immunise every child with the influenza vaccine ahead of monsoon. At a meeting held on Sunday, doctors from both groups told CM Uddhav Thackeray that administering the influenza vaccine would help curb the incidence of this disease, which in turn will help decongest hospitals and prevent unnecessary testing.While the influenza shot that contains two subtypes of influenza A and two lineages of influenza B is widely available in market, it is not a part of the vaccines given under the national immunisation programme. The vaccine costs Rs 1,500-Rs2,000 for a single shot.Dr Sanjay Oak, chairman of the state Covid taskforce, told the CM, âWe are of the opinion that the influenza vaccine should be advised proactively. Since itâs expensive, itâs mostly the middle class and upper class that can afford it. At the state level, we may think of reducing the cost or giving it to every child at least in the next six months.â Echoing him, Dr Suhas Prabhu, who heads the paediatric taskforce, told the CM that at least for this year, the state may make an exception and give the vaccine to everyone. Thackeray said the state will consider the suggestion. âHowever, we need more clarity on whether asymptomatic Covid positive child can take it,â he said, adding the task force should provide guidance. Dr Vijay Yewale, also a member of the paediatric taskforce, said flu too is a respiratory ailment. âThe vaccine is a time-tested one and routinely given to children under the age of five years. It can prevent a respiratory ailment, particularly in children with chronic condition or comorbidities,â he added.They emphasised that children who may have missed out on their routine immunisation doses should complete their schedule. âIt is safe for a child to get vaccinated with BCG, measles rubella or any vaccine they may have missed out four weeks after the onset of their Covid symptoms,â Yewale said.

This is stated in the announcement of the Food and Veterinary Agency. "The Food and Veterinary Agency after conducting diagnostic research on suspicious farms. Samples tested at the Food and Veterinary Laboratory have detected the presence of Avian Influenza A subtype H5 and N8 (Bird Flu H5N8). The test was performed on oropharyngeal swabs (chicken) with the Real Time RT-PCR method. The national crisis headquarters is working to coordinate actions on the ground to prevent and fight the disease. Poultry in 5 family farms in 4 different cities have been destroyed, and 2 other farms are being diagnosed and are being kept in isolation," the announcement states. According to the WHO, influenza H5N8 is a subtype of the influenza A virus (otherwise known as bird flu). Which is very deadly to wild birds and poultry. H5N8 does not usually infect humans; however, seven people in Russia were found to be infected in 2021, they were chicken farm workers who participated in a response operation to prevent an outbreak of avian influenza A (H5N8). The cases remained asymptomatic for the entire duration of the observation (several weeks). Follow-up nasopharyngeal swabs were collected during the medical observation period and tested negative for avian influenza A (H5N8). In this case no obvious clinical manifestation was reported by any farm workers under medical supervision, their family members or other close contacts of the seven cases. The announcement states that bird flu is mainly spread by direct contact between infected and healthy birds. It can also be transmitted when birds come into contact with equipment or materials (including water and pet food) that have been contaminated with feces or secretions from the nose or mouth of infected birds. "People can also spread the disease indirectly from farm to farm by carrying the virus on their clothing, boots or through the wheels of vehicles. Wild birds can normally carry the virus without getting sick themselves. All the official veterinarians of the AUV, together with the private veterinary practices, have been mobilized and are working in the field to locate the affected farms where all services are performed, including the disposal of dead birds and those present on the farm under the supervision of official veterinarians respecting biosecurity measures. They were supervising the farms placed in isolation. As well as the start of research in the farms around them in a perimeter of 3 kilometers. All actions are being carried out in accordance with Administrative Instruction No. 24/2005 on combating the zoonotic disease of birds 'Avian Influenza', the announcement states among other things. /Telegraph/ Categories: Agriculture Tags: AUV, Bird flu Telegraph Back to top exit mobile versionAs world debates Covid origin, here is a list of viruses that leaked from labs in past Politics Governance Diplomacy Education Economy MacroSutra Defence India Ground Reports Opinion 50-Word Edit National Interest Campus Voice Security Code Events Off The Cuff Democracy Wall Video More Features Around Town Books PastForward PoV Health HoaXposed ICYMI In Pictures Judiciary Last Laughs Sci-Tech Science Tech ThePrint Essential YourTurn Login Search FacebookInstagramLinkedinTelegramTwitterYoutube Sunday, November 10, 2024 Politics Governance Diplomacy Education Economy MacroSutra Defence India Ground Reports Opinion 50-Word Edit National Interest Campus Voice Security Code Events Off The Cuff Democracy Wall Video More Features Around Town Books PastForward PoV Health HoaXposed ICYMI In Pictures Judiciary Last Laughs Sci-Tech Science Tech ThePrint Essential YourTurn Login Search HomeHealthAs world debates Covid origin, here is a list of viruses that...

Unnati Sharma 24 May, 2021 10:01 pm IST FacebookTwitterWhatsAppLinkedin A test being done in a laboratory (representational image)| Kiyoshi Ota | Bloomberg Follow Us : Text Size: A- A+ New Delhi: The origin of SARS-CoV-2 has been debated and discussed by scientists across the world. And the one origin theory that keeps cropping up is the possibility that it leaked from a lab in China’s Wuhan. There have been several calls for a more rigorous probe into whether the Covid-19 virus escaped from a laboratory. While it remains to be definitively ascertained whether this theory is true, there have been several viral leaks from laboratories in the past. Show Full Article Chris Said, a data scientist, posted a thread on Twitter Monday, listing the various viral lab leaks throughout history. According to Said, SARS 1 or the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in 2003 that had spread to 29 countries, escaped from Asian labs. The first time a SARS 1 escaped from a virology lab was from Singapore in August 2003 in the National University of Singapore, while the second one happened in the same year in the month of December in Taiwan. The investigation revealed that a SARS research scientist in Taiwan had handled leaking biohazard waste without gloves, a mask, or a gown. In April 2004, the virus escaped from the Chinese National Institute of Virology. Similarly, the H1N1 influenza virus, which first appeared in 1918 as a global pandemic, and reappeared in 1977 probably escaped a lab. It was found that the virus may have escaped from a lab attempting to prepare an attenuated H1N1 vaccine in response to the US swine flu pandemic alert. On the H1N1 leak, Martin Furmanski, a researcher of the Scientist’s Working Group on Chemical and Biological Weapons, wrote in his 2014 paper that the authorities did not want to publicise the lab origin of the virus. “Virologists and public health officials with the appropriate sophistication were quickly aware that a laboratory release was the most likely origin, but they were content not to publicize this, aware that such embarrassing allegations would likely end the then-nascent cooperation of Russian and Chinese virologists, which was vital to worldwide influenza surveillance.” Another virus that leaked from laboratories is the smallpox. The virus had leaked from two different accredited smallpox laboratories in the UK. The first was in 1972 from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the second was in 1978 from Birmingham Medical School, from where the 1966 smallpox outbreak had also leaked. The foot and mouth disease appeared in the UK in 2007, about 4 km from a biosafety level 4 laboratory in Pirbright. The investigations into the disease revealed that construction vehicles had carried mud contaminated with FMD from a defective wastewater line at Pirbright.

A group of 18 scientists even published a letter in the Science journal on 13 May, calling for a more rigorous investigation into the virus origins. The scientists said the theories pertaining to accidental leaks from labs and natural spillover are both viable. This comes after a team sent to China by the World Health Organization concluded in March this year that the the lab leak theory was “extremely unlikely”. However, WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the research team’s assessment on whether the virus entered the human population following a laboratory incident was not “extensive enough” and required further investigation. Even leading US health expert Dr Anthony Fauci, who dismissed the lab leak theory a year ago in May 2020, has now said he is “not convinced” the virus developed naturally.
