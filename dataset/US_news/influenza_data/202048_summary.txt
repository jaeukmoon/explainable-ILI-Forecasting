1. H6 subtype avian influenza viruses, which have low pathogenicity in birds, were isolated from Southern China from 2011 to 2017. These viruses pose potential threats to poultry and mammals, including humans.

2. The H6 isolates were found to be reassortant viruses with increasing genomic diversity, but no predominant genotype was identified during this period.

3. H6N2 and some H6N6 isolates replicated efficiently in the lungs and nasal turbinates of mice without prior adaptation, indicating their ability to infect and replicate in mammals.

4. One H6N2 virus caused systemic infection in one out of three inoculated mice, suggesting that H6 avian influenza viruses, particularly H6N2, pose a potential threat to mammals.

5. Five selected H6 strains caused no clinical signs in inoculated chickens and their replication was limited in chickens, indicating low pathogenicity in poultry.

6. The study highlights the potential threat posed by H6 avian influenza viruses isolated from live poultry markets to mammals, including humans.
