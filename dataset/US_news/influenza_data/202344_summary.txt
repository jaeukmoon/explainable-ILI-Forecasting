- The economic burden of influenza is significant, especially for the elderly population.
- Influenza vaccination rates in the elderly in Malaysia are low.
- The use of quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) in Malaysia's elderly population would prevent potential influenza cases and deaths and result in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained.
- QIV would also save money currently spent on influenza-related hospitalizations and reduce productivity losses.
- A cost-effectiveness analysis found that a QIV-based vaccination program for the elderly in Malaysia is highly cost-effective.
- Implementing such a program would reduce the financial burden of managing influenza and prevent premature deaths.
