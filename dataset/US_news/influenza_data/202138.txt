To illuminate the landscape of IAV cellular restriction, we generated and integrated global genetic loss-of-function screens with transcriptomics and proteomics data. Our multi-omics analysis revealed a subset of both IFN-dependent and independent cellular defence mechanisms that inhibit IAV replication. Amongst these, the autophagy regulator TBC1 domain family member 5 (TBC1D5), which binds Rab7 to enable fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes, was found to control IAV replication in vitro and in vivo and to promote lysosomal targeting of IAV M2 protein. Notably, IAV M2 was observed to abrogate TBC1D5–Rab7 binding through a physical interaction with TBC1D5 via its cytoplasmic tail. Our results provide evidence for the molecular mechanism utilised by IAV M2 protein to escape lysosomal degradation and traffic to the cell membrane, where it supports IAV budding and growth.

From viral entry to budding, multifunctional IAV proteins simultaneously engage host factors that provide essential activities and subvert cellular mechanisms that inhibit viral replication. To dissect the complex interplay between IAV and the host cell, multiple large-scale loss-of-function and proteomics datasets have been generated1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Meta-analysis and integration of these screens have identified multiple proviral factors and pathways that are essential for IAV replication and pathogenesis and are relevant targets for host-directed therapies10,11. However, the global landscape of IAV cellular restriction remains less understood1,12.Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is among the cellular pathways identified by genetic screening to impact IAV replication11. Autophagy is a catabolic process involved in the maintenance of cellular homoeostasis and also functions as a crucial cellular defence mechanism for clearance of pathogens by lysosomal degradation13. Cellular, bacteria or viral cargo are engulfed into autophagosomes, which are double-membrane vesicles decorated with Atg8/LC3 proteins, where they are degraded on fusion with late endosomes and lysosomes14,15. The small GTPase Rab7 is a major regulator of this pathway, being responsible for the directionality of late endosome and autophagosome trafficking and their fusion with lysosomes16,17,18. Rab7 activation depends on its nucleotide state (GTP-bound active or GDP-bound inactive) and is regulated by the interaction with GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) that reside in different cellular compartments19. TBC1D5 localizes in autophagosomes and late endosomes, where it functions as a GAP for Rab7 (ref. 20). Association of Rab7 with TBC1D5 favours the recruitment of the homotypic fusion and protein-sorting (HOPS) complex and promotes SNARE-dependent fusion of late endosomes and autophagosomes with lysosomes21. Many viruses induce autophagy upon infection22. To antagonize autophagy and escape lysosomal degradation, pathogens have evolved two general strategies: either interference with autophagosomal biogenesis (for instance, herpes simplex virus (HSV-1)) or by blocking the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes (for instance, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and IAV)23,24. However, for many viruses, the molecular strategy that is used to circumvent this crucial host defence mechanism remains to be elucidated.Here, we report a global analysis of the host restrictome for IAV assembled by integrating loss-of-function screening, transcriptomics and proteomics data. Mechanistically, we show that IAV M2 protein evades lysosomal degradation by abrogating TBC1D5–Rab7 interaction thus enabling trafficking to the cell surface and budding of IAV.ResultsGlobal landscape of IAV cellular restrictionThe systematic identification of cellular factors that constrain viral replication can provide valuable insights into IAV pathogenesis7. Towards this end, we carried out arrayed genome-wide small interfering RNA (siRNA) screens in human macrophage-like THP-1 cells challenged with the seasonal influenza A/Wyoming/03/03 (Wyom/03, H3N2) virus or the highly pathogenic influenza A/Vietnam/1203/04 HALo (Viet/04, H5N1) virus (Methods; Fig. 1a). These cells were selected because macrophages mount an antiviral response to IAV (ref. 25) and THP-1 cells support productive replication of IAV (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Screens were conducted twice each using mock- or IFN-treated cells to explore the contribution of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in limiting IAV replication. The impact of each human gene knockdown on viral replication was determined by high-content imagining of IAV nucleoprotein (NP) and calculated as the percentage of IAV NP+ cells. The average Pearson correlation coefficient between screen replicates was 0.69 (Extended Data Fig. 1b) and the average z prime (z′), a statistical indicator of assay quality26, between scrambled siRNA (negative control) and immune regulator IRF9 siRNA (positive control, IFN-treated screen) or viral-targeting NP siRNA (positive control, mock-treated screen) was 0.51, suggesting favourable screening conditions26. Using a cut-off criteria for infection z-score (≥1.5 for antiviral or ≤–1.5 for proviral) and cell viability (at least 70% of scrambled siRNA), we identified 333 factors that exerted proviral activities for H3N2 and/or H5N1 IAVs and 105 that restricted viral replication (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1). These factors were cross-referenced with hits from previous loss-of-function studies for IAV and found a modest but statistically significant overlap (antiviral factors, P = 0.029) (Extended Data Fig. 1c)1,3,4,5,6,7,11. Antiviral hits identified in the genome-wide siRNA screen were further evaluated for their ability to inhibit IAV replication. Knockdown of 33 cellular factors increased the replication of H3N2 and/or H5N1 IAVs by 1.25-fold or more without altering cell viability and are summarized in Supplementary Table 2.Fig. 1: Multi-omics analysis of IAV cellular restriction.a, Schematic representation of the genome-wide siRNA screen to identify cellular factors affecting IAV replication. b, Ranked z-scores from the genome-wide siRNA screen (blue, mock-treated cells; pink, IFN-treated cells). Dashed lines illustrate z-score cut-off: z-score >1.5 indicates antiviral factors, z-score <–1.5 indicates proviral factors. Controls are shown (scrambled, negative; siIRF9 and siNP, positive), as well as known negative (STAT2) and positive (NXF1) regulators of IAV replication1. c, Integration of antiviral siRNA hits (light green, IFN-inducible; dark green, constitutive), RNA-seq (grey) and IAV M2 protein AP-MS (pink) reveals cellular networks associated with IAV restriction supported by orthogonal measurements.

Network visualization generated by Cytoscape v.3.8.0.Source dataFull size imageIntegration of loss-of-function studies with orthogonal datasets can highlight cellular factors and pathways that have multi-omics support and are probably relevant for viral infection. Using network propagation, we integrated the identified antiviral factors with published transcriptomics data of IAV-infected macrophages27. First, we calculated the cut-off values that provide maximum overlap between datasets with an enrichment factor >1 (Methods; siRNA screen cut-off z-score ≥0.5 and RNA-seq cut-off log2FC (where FC is fold change) ≥1.0 or ≤–1.0, Padj < 0.01). Then, the resulting factors were sorted as IFN-inducible or constitutively expressed on the basis of available databases28,29. Next, we applied community detection algorithms to identify densely interconnected clusters of factors that show significant membership to biological pathways and built a hierarchical ontology network that depicts the subset of cellular mechanisms that were found to inhibit IAV replication (Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 3; Methods).Analysis of the IFN-inducible factors revealed enrichment in immune response pathways, including type I IFN signalling (P = 1.85 × 10–48) and cytokine and chemokine signalling (P = 1.17 × 10–12 and 2.77 × 10–27, respectively) but also coagulation and homeostasis pathways (P = 5.14 × 10–20 and 1.89 × 10–22), important for in vitro activation of TLR3 by double-stranded RNA30 and vesicle transport and exocytosis (P = 2.78 × 10–8 and 7.84 × 10–6), which are known to be required for TLR and MyD88 signalling31 (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Importantly, this analysis revealed ISGs previously associated with IAV restriction, including members of the IFITM or OAS family1, as well as nine ISGs not previously associated with IAV restriction—ARAP2, BHLHE22, BRCA2, FAM189B/COTE1, GNG5, HLA-DOB, KDM6A/UTX, SAMSN1 and TRPS1. The inhibitory effect of all nine ISGs in IAV replication was further validated (Supplementary Table 2) suggesting that these factors warrant further investigation.Analysis of the constitutively expressed antiviral factors revealed six major networks. These were cell cycle (P = 4.50 × 10–127), G-alpha signalling (P = 9.46 × 10–268), metabolism (P = 1.58 × 10–157), RNA processing (P = 4.50 × 10–227), which included the subnetwork non-sense mediated decay (NMD)32, and protein modifications (P = 4.49 × 10–132), which included the subnetworks ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, histone modifications, and SMAD proteins phosphorylation, which is known to inhibit Zika and hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication33 (Extended Data Fig. 2b). The last major network was vesicle-mediated transport (P = 7.91 × 10–140), which included the subnetworks endocytosis, macroautophagy and phagocytosis, previously linked to macrophage clearance of invading pathogens in vitro34 (Extended Data Fig. 2b). The complete list of factors included in each pathway and their P values are shown in Supplementary Table 3.IAV M2 protein has been implicated in the regulation of several pathways represented in this network including vesicle transport, endocytosis and autophagy (Extended Data Fig. 2b). However, the interplay between M2 and these pathways has thus far eluded molecular understanding35. To address this gap, we sought to systematically identify M2–host restriction protein–protein interactions (PPIs) using affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS). These experiments were conducted using IFN-stimulated and unstimulated human lung epithelial cells (A549) to also evaluate interaction of M2 with ISGs. Strep-tagged Viet/04 H5N1 M2 (M2-Strep) or negative controls (Strep-tag only and GFP-Strep), were stably expressed in A549 cells treated or untreated with IFN, and bait proteins were pulled down by Strep-Tactin affinity purification (n = 3 replicates per condition and bait). Samples were then digested by trypsin, proteins were identified by MS and then scored for the probability of being a true interactor using the MiST scoring algorithm36 (Methods). Following the network propagation approach described above, putative M2 interactors with a MiST score ≥0.55 were integrated with the restriction network generated using the siRNA and RNA-seq data to provide insight into the interplay between M2 protein and the host restrictome (Supplementary Table 4). Though this low-stringency MiST threshold included medium confidence interactors, by combining these three datasets we illuminated factors and subnetworks that have multi-omics support and are thus more likely to be relevant negative regulators of IAV infection (Fig. 1c).The resulting network was also integrated with manually curated bioinformatic resources to create a visual model that displays the identified restriction factors (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 5; Methods). As expected, autophagy and vesicle trafficking were amongst the antiviral pathways found to interact with M2, which encompassed restriction factors not previously associated with IAV inhibition including the Golgi-bound member of the secretory pathway Rab34 (ref. 37), the inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 egress Rab27a (ref. 38) or the regulator of Rab7-mediated lysosomal degradation TBC1D5 (ref. 21) (Figs. 1c and 2). In addition, these analyses revealed interaction of M2 with several pathways not previously associated with M2 or IAV restriction, including Fanconi anaemia (FA) genes (FANCI, FANCC and FANCF), important for mitophagy, viral clearance and reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS)39, several regulators of cell cycle progression and factors involved in DNA repair including that of mitochondria origin (mtDNA), namely MSH6, RAD50/51 and BRCA2 (Figs. 1c and 2). M2 was also found to interact with several restriction factors involved in lipid metabolism, immune signalling, including JAK1 and ITPRIP, the latter of which triggers IFN-independent antiviral activities through MDA-5 association40, as well as factors exerting anti-apoptotic activities, such as the growth factor PDGF-B (ref. 41) (Figs. 1c and 2). In addition, M2 was found to interact with PCYOX1, a factor involved in degradation of prenylated proteins that restrain innate immunity42 and the deubiquitinase protein USP9X, which has been associated with restriction of HSV-1 (ref. 43) (Figs. 1c and 2). These factors were prioritized on the basis of membership to pathway, omics support and siRNA validation, and are summarized in Extended Data Fig. 3.Fig. 2: Integrated model of IAV cellular restriction.IAV restriction factors identified in this study were placed at specific subcellular localizations on the basis of curated literature research as well as Gene Ontology, KEGG and Reactome databases (Methods). Antiviral siRNA hits are shown in green (light green, IFN-inducible; dark green, constitutive), RNA-seq in grey and IAV M2 protein interactors in pink. Red circles denote antiviral factors previously associated with IAV restriction, and * shows subsequently validated siRNA hits.Source dataFull size imageTBC1D5 restricts IAV replication in vitro and ex vivoThe regulator of Rab7-mediated lysosomal degradation TBC1D5 was identified through the integrative analysis as a relevant host-restriction factor supported by all orthogonal datasets, including physical interaction with IAV M2 protein (Fig. 2). Since M2 was previously found to escape lysosomal degradation by a molecular mechanism that remains to be elucidated24,44, we thus pursued the hypothesis that TBC1D5 could be targeted by M2 to evade autophagy-mediated degradation.First, we validated TBC1D5 effect controlling IAV replication using several viral strains and cell types to exclude strain and/or cell-type specific effects. Of note, M2 sequence is relatively well conserved across different IAV strains (72.8% conservation across Wyom/03 H3N2, Viet/04 H5N1, A/WSN/33 H1N1 and A/PR8/33 H1N1 viruses). Efficient, non-cytotoxic siRNA-mediated knockdown of TBC1D5 (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b) resulted in an increase in the amount of released infectious influenza H1N1 A/WSN/33 (WSN/33) virus by ten-fold in the human lung cell line A549 (Fig. 3a). Conversely, ectopic expression of TBC1D5 significantly reduced WSN/33 virus release by fivefold in these cells (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 4c). We then investigated the effect of TBC1D5 depletion on IAV replication in human tracheobronchial epithelial (HTBE) cells, a relevant ex vivo cell model for influenza replication, and found a significant increase in WSN/33 IAV replication (Fig. 3c,d and Extended Data Fig. 4d). To further confirm TBC1D5 antiviral activity, we generated A549 CRISPR-Cas9 TBC1D5 knockout (KO) cells (Fig. 3e) and observed that WSN/33 growth was augmented by over tenfold in these cells (Fig. 3f), while cell viability was unaltered (Extended Data Fig. 4e). This effect was not due to off-target effects, as complementation of TBC1D5 KO cells recapitulated IAV infection to levels of parental cells (Fig. 3g). Taken together, these data provide functional evidence that TBC1D5 exerts antiviral activity in multiple cell types.Fig. 3: TBC1D5 restricts IAV replication in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo.a, A549 cells were transfected with indicated siRNAs for 48 h before infection with A/WSN/33 (MOI 0.01).

NS, not significant.Source dataFull size imageTBC1D5 knockdown increases IAV growth and lethality in vivoTo understand the impact of TBC1D5 depletion on IAV replication in vivo, we used peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PPMOs). PPMOs are sequence-specific antisense agents that can be administered intranasally to elicit a transient reduction in the expression of the targeted gene product in the lungs of treated mice45. Two PPMOs targeting TBC1D5 were designed and synthetized (TBC1D5 AUG and TBC1D5 e3i3) and their efficacy was validated in vitro (Fig. 3h). TBC1D5 PPMO treatment itself was non-toxic as no significant differences in body weight were detected compared to control mice (Extended Data Fig. 4f). Mice were treated with PBS, a non-targeting PPMO control (NTC) or TBC1D5-targeting PPMOs for two consecutive days, then infected with 40 p.f.u. of A/Puerto Rico/8/34 H1N1 (PR8) virus and monitored for 14 d (Fig. 3i). Treatment with TBC1D5-targeting PPMOs resulted in a significant decrease in survival as compared to PBS or NTCs (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 3j), though no differences in body weight were observed (Extended Data Fig. 4g). Lungs of mice treated with PPMOs for TBC1D5 exhibited reduced TBC1D5 expression (Fig. 3k) and significantly heightened viral titres at both day 3 and day 6 post-infection (Fig. 3l). Overall, these data are consistent with our in vitro and ex vivo findings, providing additional in vivo genetic evidence that supports a role for TBC1D5 in restricting IAV replication and growth.TBC1D5 interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of IAV M2 proteinTo validate the physical interaction between M2 and TBC1D5, co-immunoprecipitations (co-IPs) were performed in 293T cells in the context of GST-M2 pull-down (Fig. 4a). Reciprocal pull-downs of GFP-TBC1D5 in IAV-infected 293T cells confirmed an association of TBC1D5 with M2 during IAV infection (Fig. 4b). To further validate these observations, we performed a proximity ligation assay (PLA). This approach enables in situ detection of endogenous PPIs at a single molecule resolution46. 293T cells were infected with WSN/33 virus or mock-infected and then subjected to PLA staining (Fig. 4c). A significant number of PLA events were measured in the infected but not mock-infected cells, confirming that endogenous TBC1D5 and M2 interact during IAV infection (Fig. 4c,d). M2 protein consists of three domains: an ectodomain (ED), an ion-channel containing transmembrane domain (TM) and a C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (CT)35 (Fig. 4e). To further define the region of M2 that interacts with TBC1D5, we transfected 293T cells with a series of N-terminal GST-tagged M2 deletion constructs that were characterized in a previous publication7, using GST-M2 full length and GST as positive and negative control, respectively. After validating that these constructs are expressed to a similar extent in the lysates of transfected 293T cells (Extended Data Fig. 5a), we conducted PLA staining for TBC1D5 and GST to evaluate the interaction between TBC1D5 and the M2 domains. Quantification of the PLA events across all conditions revealed significant interaction of TBC1D5 with GST-M2 Full, GST-TMCT and GST-CT but not GST-ED or GST-EDTM, suggesting that M2 ED was dispensable for TBC1D5 binding but the M2 CT domain was required for the interaction (Fig. 4f,g). This is consistent with the proposed topology of M2 at the endosome, with its ED facing the endosome lumen and the CT facing the cytosol, as well as TBC1D5 localization anchored onto endosomes35,47. We further investigated the cellular localization of TBC1D5 and M2 in IAV-infected cells and found that M2 colocalizes with endogenous TBC1D5 in the perinuclear region of IAV-infected 293T cells with a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.51 (Fig. 4h). A similar colocalization between TBC1D5 and M2 was observed in A549 cells (PCC = 0.66, representative images not shown). TBC1D5 is recruited to Rab7-positive late endosomes and autophagosomes either by direct interaction with Rab7 or through its two LC3-interacting regions (LIRs)20,48. Since IAV M2 protein has also been found to colocalize with autophagosomal markers during IAV infection24, we proposed that M2 and TBC1D5 may colocalize in vesicles that are positive for Rab7. Immunolabelling of Rab7, TBC1D5 and M2 suggested that these three proteins are in close proximity in IAV-infected cells (Fig. 4i). Taken together, these data confirm TBC1D5 as a physical interactor of IAV M2 protein.Fig. 4: TBC1D5 interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of IAV M2 protein.a, 293T cells were transfected with GST or GST-M2 and subjected to GST-affinity pull-down.

Scale bar, 10 μm.Source dataFull size imageTBC1D5 promotes lysosomal targeting of IAV M2 proteinWe next examined which step in the IAV replication cycle was negatively impacted by TBC1D5. To assess if TBC1D5 was involved in early stages of IAV replication, we used an IAV minigenome reporter driven by WSN/33 virus infection49. Cells overexpressing TBC1D5, MX1, IFITM3 or the negative control vector GFP, in combination with a viral minigenome firefly (F) luciferase reporter and transfection control renilla (R) luciferase, were infected with WSN/33 virus and the F/R ratio was measured. While the overexpression of known IAV restriction factors involved in entry (IFITM3) and replication (MX1) significantly lowered the amount of F/R relative light units (RLU), TBC1D5 overexpression showed no difference compared to the negative control, suggesting that TBC1D5 does not affect viral entry, replication or transcription (Fig. 5a). TBC1D5 also did not affect translation of early or late IAV proteins, as NP and NS1 levels in cells depleted for TBC1D5 were comparable to those of negative control cells at 8 and 16 h postinfection (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Since our data revealed an interaction between TBC1D5 and M2 (Fig. 4a–g), we next evaluated M2 levels in TBC1D5-depleted cells. While NS1 levels were unchanged, increased M2 protein levels were detected at 16 and 24 h post-infection (Fig. 5b). Conversely, TBC1D5 overexpression significantly reduced both total and membrane-bound M2 (Fig. 5c). These data suggest that TBC1D5 affects M2 protein levels.Fig. 5: TBC1D5 promotes lysosomal targeting of IAV M2 protein.a, 293T cells were transfected with indicated plasmids, a firefly (F) influenza minigenome reporter and transfection control renilla (R). At 24 h post-transfection, cells were infected with A/WSN/33 (MOI 5) for 16 h and the levels of F/R measured. Data represent mean ± s.d. of F/R RLU from three independent experiments (n = 3). b, 293T cells were treated with indicated siRNAs for 48 h before infection with A/WSN/33 (MOI 2). At indicated h p.i., protein levels were analysed using SDS–PAGE.

IAV M2 protein reduces fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes and redirects the autophagosomal marker LC3 to the plasma membrane, where M2 drives budding of IAVs24,44. Failure to evade lysosomal degradation reduces M2 levels and results in decreased viral growth50. TBC1D5 regulates Rab7 activation, which in turn controls fusion of late endosomes and autophagosomes with lysosomes51 (Discussion). To explore if TBC1D5 depletion reduces fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, we measured autophagic flux using a fluorescent tandem reporter coupled to the autophagosome marker LC3B (RFP-GFP-LC3B)52. Using this system, autophagosomes display both RFP and GFP fluorescence. However, upon fusion with lysosomes, the GFP signal is quenched and only the acid-insensitive RFP signal can be detected (Fig. 5d). First, to evaluate the basal autophagic flux in these cells, parental cells were transduced with the tandem RFP-GFP-LC3B reporter and either mock-treated or treated with chloroquine (CQ), an inhibitor of autophagosomes and lysosomes fusion. Then the ratio of LC3-GFP+/LC3-RFP+ puncta per cell was calculated. The relative number of LC3-GFP+ puncta was significantly reduced in mock-treated compared to CQ-treated cells, suggesting that parental cells support fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes (Fig. 5e,f, upper panel). In contrast, TBC1D5 KO cells that were mock-treated showed no significant differences in the relative number of LC3-GFP+ puncta compared to those treated with CQ, suggesting that in TBC1D5 KO cells the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes is reduced (Fig. 5e,f, bottom panel).Because TBC1D5-depleted cells displayed reduced fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes and supported increased M2 protein levels (Fig. 5b,f), we proposed that TBC1D5 could promote lysosomal degradation of M2. To test this, we assessed the colocalization of M2 and lysosomes in parental and TBC1D5 KO cells, using the acidic organelle dye Lysotracker. The colocalization of M2 and Lysotracker was significantly reduced in TBC1D5-depleted cells (P < 0.0043; Fig. 5g,h), suggesting that lysosomal targeting of M2 is reduced in the absence of TBC1D5. Conversely, consistent with previous M2 protein levels measurements (Fig. 5c), cells depleted for TBC1D5 showed a significant enhancement of cell surface-bound M2 over time (Extended Data Fig. 6b). To further confirm that TBC1D5 promotes lysosomal targeting of M2, control cells or cells overexpressing TBC1D5 were treated with DMSO or CQ and the levels of surface M2 were measured. TBC1D5 overexpression showed reduced M2 levels at the plasma membrane in DMSO-treated but not CQ-treated cells (Fig. 5i), further indicating that TBC1D5 promotes lysosomal targeting of M2 protein.IAV M2 protein abrogates TBC1D5 and Rab7 interactionSince TBC1D5 promotes autophagic flux and M2 reduces fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes24, we hypothesised that M2 antagonizes TBC1D5 activity to evade lysosomal degradation. Binding of TBC1D5 regulates Rab7 activation state, which is essential for vesicle trafficking and fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes16. Therefore, we investigated Rab7–TBC1D5 physical interaction in the presence and absence of IAV infection. Upon Rab7 immunoprecipitation, we observed reduced Rab7–TBC1D5 association in WSN/33 infected cells as compared to uninfected cells (Fig. 6a). Notably, Rab7–TBC1D5 interaction was reduced in a multiplicity of infection (MOI)-dependent manner (Fig. 6b). Similar results were observed when we immunoprecipitated TBC1D5, as IAV infection resulted in lower Rab7 association (Fig. 6c). To further validate these observations in the context of endogenous TBC1D5 and Rab7, we performed PLA assays. The ability of this system to capture differences in the number of Rab7–TBC1D5 interaction events was validated using cells depleted for TBC1D5 (Extended Data Fig. 7a). 293T cells were then infected with A/Puerto Rico/8/34 H1N1 (PR8) or mock-infected and then subjected to PLA staining to detect if endogenous TBC1D5 and Rab7 interact in the presence of IAV infection. Consistent with the biochemical data, we observed a significant reduction of TBC1D5 and Rab7 interaction in PR8-infected cells as compared to mock-infected cells (P < 0.0001; Fig. 6d,e). This difference was not due to reduced TBC1D5 or Rab7 protein levels in IAV-infected cells, as shown by protein levels analyses carried out in parallel (Extended Data Fig. 7b). We then investigated if M2 is necessary to abrogate this interaction by using a PR8 virus that contains a stop codon on the M segment to prevent M2 expression (PR8 ΔM2)24. While the infectivity of this mutant virus was not affected (Extended Data Fig. 7c), we validated that M2-deficient viruses were unable to block fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes, as reflected by increased LC3-II accumulation (Extended Data Fig. 7d)24. Critically, the interaction between TBC1D5 and Rab7 was not disrupted in 293T cells infected with the M2-deficient virus, since we observed comparable number of PLA events to those in uninfected conditions (Fig. 6d,e).Fig. 6: M2 protein abrogates TBC1D5 and Rab7 interaction.a, 293T cells were transfected with GFP or GFP-Rab7 and infected with A/WSN/33 (MOI 3) for 24 h.

Inputs and IP samples were analysed by SDS–PAGE using indicated antibodies. b, 293T cells were transfected with GFP or GFP-Rab7 and infected with A/WSN/33 (MOI 2, 5 and 10) for 24 h.

IAV M2 protein abrogates interaction of TBC1D5 with Rab7, which in turn prevents fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. By escaping degradation at the lysosome, M2 can now assist IAV budding at the plasma membrane and support viral growth.Source dataFull size imageRab7 activation is essential for vesicle trafficking and fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes16 and depends on its nucleotide state (GTP-bound active or GDP-bound inactive), which is controlled by association with GAP and GEF regulators. We therefore suggested that IAV M2 could abrogate Rab7–TBC1D5 interaction to reduce Rab7 activation. To test this, we took advantage of an antibody that specifically recognizes active GTP-bound Rab7. We validated the specificity of this antibody by detecting immunofluorescence signal in cells transfected with wild-type (WT) Rab7 or the constitutively active GTP-bound Q67L-Rab7 mutant but not in the T22N-Rab7 mutant, which harbours higher GDP affinity (Extended Data Fig. 7e)53. Using this antibody, we measured Rab7 activation status (GTP-Rab7otal Rab7 ratio) in mock-infected cells or cells infected with WT or the M2-deficient virus. While M2-deficient IAV-infected cells did not alter Rab7 nucleotide-binding state (P > 0.999 compared to non-infected), cells infected with WT-PR8 virus showed a significant reduction in Rab7 activation levels (**P = 0.0044 compared to non-infected and ***P < 0.0005 compared to M2-deficient PR8) (Fig. 6f,g). Taken together, these data support a model wherein in steady-state conditions, TBC1D5 interacts with Rab7, which enables fusion of late endosomes and autophagosomes with lysosomes and thus cargo degradation (Fig. 6h, right panel). In IAV-infected cells, extensive accumulation of M2 at the ER triggers autophagy and results in the incorporation of M2 in autophagosomes (Fig. 6h, left panel). These M2 proteins abrogate TBC1D5–Rab7 interaction, which reduces Rab7 activation and arrests lysosomal fusion, thus enabling M2 to traffic to the plasma membrane to support IAV budding and growth (Fig. 6h, left panel).DiscussionSuccessful completion of the IAV replication cycle involves co-option of essential cellular factors and antagonism of antiviral activities. Previous genome-wide loss-of-function screens have provided considerable insight into cellular factors that are essential for IAV replication7,11. However, much less is known about host factors involved in IAV restriction at a global scale, particularly in the context of immune cells that are responsible for mounting immune responses against IAV25. Here, we conducted a genome-wide siRNA screen using human macrophage-like cells and integrated the identified antiviral factors with global transcriptomics of IAV-infected macrophages. These analyses provided insight into the global landscape of IAV cellular restriction, which was clustered into IFN-inducible or constitutive mechanisms. Analysis of the IFN-inducible factors revealed, as expected, enrichment in the type I IFN response, including ISGs with known roles in IAV restriction and nine validated ISGs not previously linked to IAV, including the guanine nucleotide-binding protein GNG5, recently reported interactor of SARS-CoV-2 (refs. 54,55) (Extended Data Fig. 3). While the IFN response is generally fast and efficient, providing an important first-line defence against invading pathogens, it can also trigger excessive inflammation and cause immunopathology56. Analysis of the constitutive antiviral factors found in this study show that cells also rely on an extensive set of cell-intrinsic mechanisms to control IAV infection, including metabolic pathways such as glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis, whose intermediate metabolites have been previously linked to viral restriction57,58, NMD, which can promote decay of viral messenger RNAs32, the ubiquitin/proteosome pathway, known to target viral proteins for proteolysis59, vesicle sorting and autophagy (Extended Data Fig. 2b).Regulation of vesicle sorting and autophagy have been previously associated with IAV M2 protein. However, the molecular regulators of these activities remained to be elucidated. Integration of these antiviral clusters with an IAV M2 PPI network provided potential insight into the interplay of M2 with these antiviral mechanisms. M2 interactors were predominantly enriched in pathways that included vesicle transport, exocytosis and membrane docking, which are consistent with M2 trafficking using the secretory and/or autophagy pathways35 (Fig. 1c). In addition, factors and pathways not previously associated with M2 interaction or IAV antiviral activity were identified, including those involved in mtDNA repair, mitophagy, mitochondrial homoeostasis and apoptosis, suggesting that the mitochondrion is a crucial platform for cell-intrinsic restriction of IAV and that M2 is either the target or the antagonist of these cellular defence mechanisms.The identification of these pathways, complexes and factors that are supported by orthogonal datasets suggest that they may be more likely to be physiologically relevant antiviral regulators of IAV replication. For instance, this study uncovers the role of the autophagy regulator TBC1D5 as a restriction factor of IAV infection. TBC1D5 was not amongst the most potent hits from the functional genetic screen, as it would be expected for a factor targeted for viral evasion, but it was prioritized on the basis of orthogonal data including the M2 AP-MS. Therefore, multi-omics integration enables the identification of factors that may be missed due to prioritization based only on activity from a single data source but have important roles in host–pathogen interactions. Taken together, we report 111 host-restriction factors not previously reported to impinge on IAV replication (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 5) and a list of prioritized factors including those with multiple levels of orthogonal support (Extended Data Fig. 3). Additional studies will be required to illuminate their role in IAV pathogenesis in an ex vivo, in vivo and clinical context.IAV infection induces both canonical and non-canonical autophagy, which represent critical cellular defence mechanisms for pathogen clearance through fusion of the pathogen-engulfed vesicles with lysosomes60,61. To escape degradation, M2 protein has been shown to reduce fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes and instead traffic to the plasma membrane where it supports IAV budding24,44. However, the molecular mechanism behind this evasion strategy remained to be elucidated. Data generated in this study indicate that M2 abrogates TBC1D5 and Rab7 interaction to reduce Rab7 activation and thus fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes16. However, this viral evasion strategy seems to be dependent on the stoichiometry of TBC1D5 and M2 proteins in the cell (Fig. 6b). Increased TBC1D5 expression probably overwhelms the ability of M2 to block TBC1D5 interaction with Rab7, resulting in M2 degradation. Conversely, TBC1D5 depletion probably reduces the need for M2 to inhibit TBC1D5 interaction with Rab7, resulting in enhanced M2 protein levels at the cellular surface.Rab7 activation is essential for both the recruitment of SNARE-like proteins that fuse the membranes of late endosomes and autophagosomes with lysosomes21 and for dictating the directionality of vesicle trafficking (anterograde to the plasma membrane or retrograde to the perinuclear region where lysosomes reside)17,18,62,63. Therefore, displacement of Rab7–TBC1D5 physical interaction might be a prerequisite for arresting fusion with lysosomes and redirecting the M2-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane, where M2 initiates viral budding and promotes IAV growth. Notably, two bacterial pathogens have been previously shown to target Rab7 activation to promote survival. Legionella pneumophila secretes the effector protein RidL, which prevents recruitment of TBC1D5 to Rab7 (refs. 64,65). In addition, Salmonella enterica SopD2 protein blocks Rab7 nucleotide exchange, preventing its association with effectors Rab-interacting lysosomal protein (RILP) and FYVE and coiled-coil (CC) domain-containing protein (FYCO1), which govern endosome, lysosome and autophagosome trafficking16,66. Induction of autophagy is a crucial feature of infection by multiple viral families, including flaviviruses and coronaviruses22. Since the manipulation of Rab7 activation represents a critical node exploited by both bacteria and viruses to escape lysosomal degradation, targeting of this molecular circuit probably represents a convergent evolutionary evasion strategy. Therefore, therapeutic targeting of this mechanism may be an important strategy for the development of broad-spectrum antivirals that act to restore lysosomal degradation of viral cargo.MethodsCells and virusesA549 (ATCC CCL-185), MDCK (ATCC CCL-34), HEK293T (ATCC CRL-3216) and MEF (ATCC CRL-2991) cells were cultured in DMEM (Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies), 2 mM l-glutamine (Fisher Scientific), 10 mM HEPES (Fisher Scientific),100 U ml–1 of penicillin and 100 μg ml–1 of streptomycin (Fisher Scientific).

Flow cytometry: mouse monoclonal anti-M2 E10 (Mount Sinai, in-house antibody, 1:2,000).Genome-wide siRNA screenA genome-wide siRNA screen was carried out in human macrophage-like THP-1 cells to identify host cell factors that affect the replication of IAV. The screen was performed using the arrayed genome-wide ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA library (Dharmacon), where each pool contains four unique siRNAs targeting each human gene. In addition, non-targeting siRNAs (scrambled) were added to each plate as negative controls and siRNAs targeting IRF9 and IAV NP were included as positive controls. The siRNA sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 6. THP-1 cells were differentiated using 10 ng ml–1 phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) for 72 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Pooled siRNAs were arrayed in 384-well plates at a concentration of 12.5 nM siRNA per well. To enable the formation of siRNA-transfection reagent complexes, 0.075 μl of Lipofectamine RNA interference MAX (RNAiMAX) transfection reagent diluted in 9.925 μl of Opti-MEM media (both reagents Thermo Fisher Scientific) were added to each well. Following a 20 min incubation period at room temperature, 15,000 differentiated THP-1 cells diluted in 20 μl of RPMI media supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% PenStrep and 1% HEPES were seeded on top of the complexes and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were then mock-treated or treated with 100 IU ml–1 universal interferon beta (IFN, R&D Systems) diluted in 10 μl of serum-free RPMI media. After 6 h of incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, media were removed and cells were infected with IAV A/Wyoming/3/2003 H3N2 (MOI 0.50) or A/Vietnam/1203/2004 H5N1 HALo (MOI 0.25) diluted in 20 μl of serum-free RPMI media. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, the inoculum was removed and replaced with 40 μl of serum-free RPMI media and cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were then fixed with 4% PFA (Boston BioProducts) for 30 min at room temperature and washed twice with PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min, followed by blocking with 3% BSA (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary anti-NP mouse monoclonal (HT103, in-house antibody) was added for 2 h at room temperature, followed by three washes with PBS and a 1-h incubation with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalogue no. A-11001) diluted in 3% BSA. Following three washes with PBS, cells were stained with DAPI (4,6-diamidine-2-phenylindole, KPL) and plates were sealed and stored at 4 °C until imaging.High-content imaging and data analysisViral replication was assessed using high-throughput microscopy. The assay plates were imaged using the IC200 imaging system (Vala Sciences) located at the Conrad Prebys Center for Chemical Genomics (CPCCG). The analysis software Columbus v.2.5 (Perkin Elmer) was used to calculate infectivity (number of Alexa 488+ objects per number of DAPI+ objects). Screens were run twice and the infectivity values for each well were normalized to the median of each plate. The hit calling strategy was based on z-score values. The z-score is a statistical value that evaluates the number of standard deviations from the mean of the population and is calculated as the (log2FC siRNA x – mean log2FC of the sample)/ s.d. of the sample. In context of siRNA screening, it ranks the effects of each siRNA across the entire population. Factors with a corresponding z-score <–1.5 were considered host-dependency factors and those with a z-score >1.5 host-restriction factors. Cytotoxicity resulting from siRNA transfection was evaluated by counting the total number of cells per well and normalizing to the value for the negative control siRNA. Targeting siRNAs resulting in cytotoxicity measurements <70% compared to scrambled siRNA were considered cytotoxic and removed from the hit list.Oseltamivir treatmentA total of 15,000 PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells (Genome-wide siRNA screen) were seeded overnight. Cells were then treated with 100 IU ml–1 of universal interferon or mock-treated for 6 h and then treated with 1 µM of oseltamivir (Sigma) for 2 h before infection with A/Wyoming/03/03 H3N2 (MOI 0.50). At 24 h postinfection the percentage of infected cells was calculated on the basis of DAPI staining and viral NP immunostaining.GO overrepresentation analysisThe genetic screen hits were tested for pathway and process enrichment using the following ontology sources: KEGG Pathway, gene ontology (GO) biological processes, Reactome Gene Sets, Canonical Pathways, CORUM, TRRUST, DisGeNET and PaGenBase, using the whole genome as the enrichment background. Terms with P < 0.01, a minimum count of 3 and a ratio between the observed and the expected by chance counts >1.5, were collected and grouped into clusters on the basis of their membership similarities. Here, P values are calculated on the basis of the accumulative hypergeometric distribution. The most statistically significant term and higher membership within a cluster is chosen to represent the cluster.AP-MSThe complete coding sequences for H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/05-HALo M2 or eGFP (GQ404376.1) were cloned into pLVX-TetOne-Puro (Clontech) with a C-terminal 2×Strep-tag. To generate lentiviruses, these constructs were cotransfected with Gag-Pol packaging construct and VSV-G envelope (pMD2.G, Addgene) into HEK293T cells. A549 cells were transduced with the generated lentiviruses and selected under 1 μg ml–1 of puromycin. The expression of viral proteins or GFP was confirmed by western blot. For immunoprecipitation, expression of M2 or GFP was induced with 1 μg ml–1 of dox for 12 h and cells were then treated with 1,000 IU ml–1 of IFN for an additional 12 h. Cells were then lysed, cleared of cellular debris and bound with Strep-Tactin Sepharose beads (IBA Lifesciences) in IP buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA). Beads were washed four times (twice with 0.05% NP-40 and twice without) before on-bead protein digest. Strep-Tactin-purified proteins were reduced and alkylated on beads with reduction-alkylation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 M urea, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 3 mM iodoacetamide). Subsequently, 3 mM DTT was added to quench the reaction and proteins were digested with 0.75 µg of trypsin (Invitrogen). Formic acid (1%) was added to acidify the peptides. Peptides were desalted using Agilent OMIX C18 tips. Digested peptides were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis using an Easy-nLC 1000 coupled to a dual-pressure linear ion trap (Velos Pro) Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were eluted by a gradient of 5–30% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid in 110 min delivered at a flow rate of 300 nl min–1. For each cycle, one full MS scan (150–1,500 m/z, resolution of 120,000) in the Orbitrap was followed by 20 data-dependent MS/MS scans fragmented by normalized collision energy (setting of 35%) and acquired in the linear ion trap. Raw MS files were analysed by MaxQuant v.1.3.0.3 and MS/MS spectra searched by the Andromeda search engine against a database containing reviewed SwissProt human and influenza protein sequences (20,226 total). For each bait and control, putative interactors were scored for their probability of being a true interactor using the MiST algorithm, which provides a composite score taking into account the abundance, specificity and reproducibility of each identified protein36. To increase confidence in each interaction, all runs from each bait were analysed together regardless of condition and to better estimate specificity of these interactions for the MiST algorithm, these data were scored relative to other IAV baits pulled down also in A549 cells under these same conditions (access to files including the additional baits available at: https://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/private-dataset.jsp?task=82154043f1ca4b0c9e22c10aa091f476, password: pandemic).siRNA, RNA-seq and AP-MS data integration and network analysisTo select the cut-off criteria that will result in the highest number of overlapping factors across the siRNA and RNA-seq datasets, while maintaining a larger overlap than expected by chance (enrichment factor >1), the number of observed overlapping genes between genetic data, RNA-seq and AP-MS were calculated across a range of z-score, log2FC and MiST thresholds. The enrichment factor was calculated as the number of observed divided by the number of expected overlapping genes. Expected values were computed by randomly permuting the genetic data and measuring the overlap on the permuted values. The expected value was the mean value over 100 random permutations. On the basis of these analyses, the following cut-off values were selected which optimized the enrichment factor and number of overlapping genes over the range of thresholds tested: siRNA z-score ≥0.5, RNA-seq log2FC ≥1.0 or ≤–1.0 and P <0.005, MiST ≥0.55. To explore the highest confidence interactions of the input factors list, we selected the STRING - Human Protein Links - High Confidence (score ≥0.7) protein–protein interaction network available on the Network Data Exchange (NDEx). We then identified densely interconnected regions (‘communities’) amongst the input list, using the community detection algorithm HiDeF via the Community Detection Application and Service (CDAPS)69 (app available at http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/cycommunitydetection). The resulting HiDeF from CDAPS was a ‘hierarchy’ network where each node represented a community of proteins and edges denoted containment of one community (the ‘child’) by another (the ‘parent’). Finally, the hierarchy network was styled, communities were labelled by functional enrichment using gProfiler (via CDAPS) and a layout was applied. The STRING - Human Protein Links - High Confidence (score ≥0.7) network is available in NDEx at http:/dexbio.org/#etwork/275bd84e-3d18-11e8-a935-0ac135e8bacf. Molecular complex detection (MCODE) and GO analyses were applied to the resulting overlapping factors to highlight densely connected subnetworks. Nodes with over ten members (IFN-inducible) or over 20 members (constitutive) are shown (Extended Data Fig. 2). To provide more stringency on the network and provide biochemical context to the identified nodes, those factors identified in two or more siRNA screens were integrated with the IAV M2–host AP-MS hits identified using a low stringency MiST score ≥0.55 and the resulting network was subjected to MCODE analyses (Cytoscape) to find highly interconnected regions (Fig. 1c). Network visualization was based on Metascape (http://www.metascape.org) and Cytoscape (http://www.cytoscape.org, v.3.8.0)70,71.Generation of the integrated model of IAV cellular restrictionThe identified restriction factors were evaluated for pathway enrichment using the following ontology sources: KEGG Pathway, Reactome Gene Sets, GO biological processes, CORUM, Canonical Pathways, TRRUST, DisGeNET and PaGenBase. Resulting data were reviewed and manually curated using published literature. Factors were then placed on the basis of their reported subcellular localization, clustered into functional categories shown in light blue boxes and labelled accordingly.Virus infectionCells were seeded overnight and then infected with indicated IAV strains in 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 0.3% BSA, 0.01 mM Ca2+ and 0.02 mM Mg2+. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, cells were washed and culture medium containing 1 μg ml–1 of TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma) was added. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C and supernatant samples collected at indicated times. Viral titre in supernatants was determined by plaque assay using MDCK cells.Generation of CRISPR-Cas9 TBC1D5 KO cellsTo generate CRISPR-Cas9 TBC1D5 KO cells, we targeted the TBC1D5 locus sequence CTTGGCAACAATAAGGCAGA with the commercial gRNA CRISPRevolution srRNA EZ-17406474 (Synthego). The gRNA was transfected into A549-dox-Cas9 cells previously treated with doxycycline (1 μg ml–1; Clontech) for 48 h. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were plated for colony formation. Colonies derived from single cells were screened for TBC1D5 knockout using western blot analysis.IAV minigenome assaysMinigenome-based assays were performed as described previously72. Briefly, 293T cells were transfected with an influenza-like minigenome encoding a negative-sense firefly and the internal control renilla (kindly provided by W. Barclay, Imperial College London, UK) using Fugene (Promega) transfection reagent. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were infected with A/WSN/33 (H1N1) at MOI 5 for 16 h. Firefly and renilla RLU were measured using Dual-Glo Luciferase assay (Promega).Flow cytometry analysis of M2 expression293T cells were mock-treated or infected with A/WSN/33 at an MOI of 2 and incubated for indicated times. Cells were trypsinized, washed in 1× PBS (Gibco) with 3% FBS and subjected to permeabilization with 0.1% Tween 20 (total M2). Cells were then blocked in 1× PBS with 1:200 dilution of normal rabbit serum (Abcam, ab7487) for 2 h at room temperature. Membrane-bound (surface) and total M2 were labelled using an anti-IAV M2 (E10, Mount Sinai) overnight at 4 °C in 1× PBS with 3% FBS. Cells were then stained with a goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568 secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher) for 2 h at room temperature, washed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Fluorescence M2 mean intensities were recorded using Attune NxT Flow Cytometer (Thermo Fisher) and analysed using FlowJo software v.10.0 (Tree Star).GST pull-down assaysA total of 1 × 107 293T cells were seeded in poly-d-lysine (Corning) 15-cm dishes and incubated overnight. Cells were then transfected with GST or GST-M2 (A/WSN/33) using Fugene (Promega) as transfection reagent. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were washed with ice-cold 1× PBS and lysed using Pierce IP Lysis Buffer (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Protein lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 4,000g for 15 min at 4 °C and input samples were collected and stored at –20 °C. The remaining lysates were incubated with Gluthatione Sepharose beads (Thermo Fisher) in a rotator overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times and proteins collected by addition of 2× NuPAGE sample buffer (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 50 mM DTT and heated for 10 min at 95 °C. Samples were analysed by immunoblotting.GFP-trap immunoprecipitation assaysA total of 1 × 107 293T cells were seeded in poly-d-lysine (Corning) 15-cm dishes and incubated overnight. Cells were then transfected with GFP, GFP-TBC1D5 or GFP-Rab7. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were infected with A/WSN/33 (H1N1) at MOI 5 (unless otherwise stated) for 18 h. Cells were then washed with ice-cold 1× PBS and lysed using Pierce IP Lysis Buffer (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Protein lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 4,000g for 15 min at 4 °C and an input sample was collected and stored at –20 °C. The remaining lysates were incubated with GFP-trap beads (Chromotek) in a rotator for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed four times and proteins collected by addition of 2× SDS NuPAGE sample buffer (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 50 mM DTT and heated for 10 min at 95 °C. Samples were analysed by immunoblotting.RFP-GFP-LC3B tandem reporter studiesA549 parental and TBC1D5 KO cells were seeded in glass-bottom 24-well plates (Cellvis) and incubated overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were then treated with BacMam 2.0 RFP-GFP-LC3B reagent (Thermo Fisher, P36239) (MOI 50) for 24 h and then infected with A/WSN/33 (MOI 3) or treated with 100 μM chloroquine (CQ). At 16 h p.i., cells were treated with Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher, H3570) for 20 min at room temperature and then imaged using the Nikon A1R HD confocal microscope. The number of LC3-RFP+ and LC3-GFP+ puncta per cell was quantified using Fiji73. Finally, the ratio LC3-GFP+/LC3-RFP+ ratio was calculated.Confocal imaging and colocalization studiesA549 or 293T cells were seeded in glass-bottom plates (Cellvis) and incubated overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were washed twice with 1× PBS and infected with A/WSN/33 at indicated MOI for 1 h on ice to synchronize infection. Inoculum was then removed and replaced with fresh serum-free media. At indicated time points, cells were washed twice with 1× PBS and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (Boston BioProducts) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized using 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min, followed by 1 h of blocking with 3% BSA (Sigma) at room temperature. Cells were stained with DAPI (KPL) and immunolabelled with indicated antibodies. Images were acquired using the Nikon A1R HD confocal microscope and colocalization was assessed using PCC. PCC was calculated using Fiji’s software73.Proximity ligation assays293T cells were seeded in 96-well glass-bottom plates (Cellvis) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Cells were either transfected with GST constructs (M2 domain mapping interaction studies) or infected with either A/WSN/33 (M2-TBC1D5 interaction studies), A/PR8 WT or A/PR8 ΔM2 (TBC1D5–Rab7 interaction studies) at MOI 3. After 1 h of incubation on ice to enable viral infection synchronization, the inoculum was removed and replaced with fresh serum-free media. At 16 h post-transfection or 12 h postinfection, cells were washed twice with 1× PBS, fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (Boston BioProducts) and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were then subjected to Duolink PLA Fluorescence protocol (Sigma). Briefly, cells were blocked with Duolink Blocking solution (Sigma) in a heated humidity chamber for 60 min at 37 °C. Rabbit anti-TBC1D5 (Atlas, HPA035125), mouse monoclonal anti-GST (Cell Signaling, no. 2624), mouse monoclonal anti-M2 E10 (Mount Sinai, in-house antibody) or mouse anti-Rab7 (Cell Signaling, no. 95746) were diluted in Duolink Antibody Diluent (Sigma), applied to the samples and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed 3 × 10 min with PLA Wash Buffer A (Sigma) and incubated with Rabbit-PLUS and Mouse-MINUS PLA probes (Sigma) in a preheated humidity chamber for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed 3 × 10 min with PLA Wash Buffer A (Sigma) and incubated with 1× Ligation solution (Sigma) in a preheated humidity chamber for 30 min at 37 °C. After 3 × 10 min with PLA Wash Buffer A (Sigma), cells were incubated with Amplification Solution (Sigma) in a preheated humidity chamber for 1 h at 40 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed 3 × 10 min with PLA Wash Buffer B (Sigma) and stained with Phalloidin-iFluor 488 (Abcam, 176753) and Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher, H3570) for 20 min at room temperature. Images were acquired using the Nikon A1R HD confocal microscope and analysed using Fiji73. Single cells were defined based on Phalloiding staining and the number of dots within each region of interest (ROI) was quantified using Fiji’s analyse particle feature.Rab7 activation status measurement293T cells were seeded in 96-well glass-bottom plates (Cellvis), transfected with GFP-Rab7 WT and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with 1× PBS and infected with A/PR8 WT or A/PR8 ΔM2 at MOI 3 or left uninfected. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature to enable virus absorption, the inoculum was removed and replaced with fresh serum-free media. At 16 h p.i., cells were washed twice with 1× PBS, fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (Boston BioProducts) and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were then treated with mouse monoclonal anti-Rab7 GTP overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed for 3 × 10 min with PBS and incubated with anti-mouse Alexa 568 for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed for 3 × 10 min with PBS and stained with Phalloidin-iFluor 488 (Abcam, 176753) and Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fisher, H3570) for 20 min at room temperature. Images were acquired using the Nikon A1R HD confocal microscope. Images were projected in Z and analysed for vesicle segmentation and quantification with Icy v.2.0.3.0 (http://icy.bioimageanalysis.com) with the procedures published in ref. 74. Briefly, individual cell nuclei were identified using the HK-means tool to create nuclear masks, following which, we used the active contours plugin to enlarge the ROIs/ masks around the individual nucleus in the Rab7-GFP channel to enlarge the masks to their intracellular vesicles. This second method dilates the masks only for Rab7-GFP positive cells (Extended Data Fig. 7f). The created masks in both HK-means step and active contours were visually inspected for correct segmentation. The individual cell, individual fluorescence channel quantification of total cells and Rab7-GFP positive cells was exported from the software then plotted as normalized (to minimum, maximum per biological condition) Rab7/GTP-Rab7 ratio.PPMO synthesis and designPeptide-conjugated PPMOs were synthesized in the Moulton Lab at Oregon State University. For each PPMO, the cell-penetrating peptide (RXR)4 (where R is arginine and X is 6-aminohexanoic acid) was covalently conjugated to a morpholino oligomer (Gene Tools) at the 3′ end through a non-cleavable linker, by methods described previously75. Two PPMOs targeting TBC1D5 were generated: (1) TBC1D5 AUG, designed to target the translation start site region of the TBC1D5 mRNA (morpholino sequence: TCAGACACAGACTTATACATTGCAT) and (2) TBC1D5 e3i3, which targets the splice site between exon 3 and intron 3 of the TBC1D5 pre-mRNA (morpholino sequence: CTGCATCTGCACAGAAAACTTACCT). In addition, an NTC PPMO was designed (morpholino sequence: CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA), having little homology to mouse transcripts or influenza viral sequences.Animal experimentsMice used in this study were purchased from the Jackson Laboratories. Mice were 5 weeks old, belonging to the BALB/c strain and all female mice were housed at 21 °C, with humidity of 35% and 12 h dark/ 12 h light cycle. Mice were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine and xylazine (100 μg and 5 μg per gram of body weight), before intranasal administration of either PBS or 100 μg of PPMO combination (50 μg of PPMO TBC1D5 AUG and 50 μg of PPMO TBC1D5 e3i3) in 40 μl of 1× PBS (the equivalent of ~5 mg kg–1) on day 2 and day 1. On day 0, mice were challenged intranasally with 40 p.f.u. A/PR8 IAV (LD50 = 50 p.f.u.) in 40 μl of PBS. Mice were monitored daily for weight loss and clinical signs. Mouse lungs were harvested on day 3 and day 6 p.i. to evaluate viral titres (n = 5). Lung homogenates were prepared using a FastPrep24 system (MP Biomedicals). After addition of 800 μl of PBS containing 0.3% BSA, lungs were subjected to two rounds of mechanical treatment for 10 s each at 6.5 m s–1. Tissue debris was removed by low-speed centrifugation and virus titres in supernatants were determined by plaque assay. A group of mice (n = 5) was monitored for survival at 14 d p.i.Ethics statementAll research studies involving the use of animals were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York and were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.StatisticsData distribution was assumed to be normal but this was not formally tested.

An estimated 675,000 of those deaths occurred in the United States.Now, 18 months into the coronavirus pandemic, the virus has claimed more American lives than its counterpart a hundred years ago.At this point, at least 675,446 Americans have been confirmed to have died since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University, with thousands of Americans lives still being lost each day.Surpassing the 1918 death toll is a dismal milestone, but experts suggest there are key differences between both pandemics that must be taken into account, given modern day access to better medical treatments and vaccinations.Red Cross Motor Corps are on duty during the Spanish Influenza epidemic in St. Louis in 1918.Universal Images Group via Getty Images, FILEMORE: Photos: How the 1918 flu and COVID-19 pandemics compare"These are two different viruses, two different times in history, at two different times of medical history, with what you have available to combat or treat it," Howard Markel, professor of the history of medicine at the University of Michigan, told ABC News.The influenza outbreak of 1918 began in the spring, with the novel H1N1 virus passing from birds to humans, and lasted for approximately two years. Approximately one-third of the world's population at that time, or 500 million people, was ultimately estimated to have been infected, according to the CDC.According to experts, it is important to recall, when comparing data from the two pandemics, that the numbers of deaths stemming from the 1918 pandemic are just estimates. In fact, according to Dr. Graham Mooney, assistant professor of the history of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, it is likely that these figures were significantly underestimated, because of non-registration, missing records, misdiagnosis or underreporting.MORE: Few people medically exempt from getting COVID-19 vaccine: ExpertsLikewise, experts believe that the current COVID-19 death count could already be greatly undercounted, due to inconsistent reporting by states and localities, and the exclusion of excess deaths.In comparing the pandemics, Markel said, it is important to remember that we now have many more people living in the U.S. than in 1918, when the population stood at approximately 105 million, according to census data, compared to 328 million people in 2019.MORE: Mississippi health officials plea for vaccination after 'significant' number of COVID-19 fatalities in pregnant womenThe U.S. currently has a coronavirus case fatality rate of 1.6%, compared to the 2.5% fatality rate for influenza in 1918, noted Mooney. Normally, the flu's fatality rate is less than 0.1%. And thus, the rate of death in the United States, due to COVID-19, remains significantly below the one attributed to the 1918 pandemic.Ultimately, when compared on a per-capita basis, the pandemic of 1918 was far deadlier than this one, according to Christopher McKnight Nichols, associate professor of history at Oregon State University."The difference is that 1 in 500 Americans have died now, and about 1 in 152 died in 1918, although our number keeps going up," Nichols told ABC News.Vaccinations and traditional intervention methods key to protectionAlthough the two pandemics were at first comparable, the introduction of the coronavirus vaccine made the differences between the two "stark," said Nichols."People were desperate for treatment measures in 1918. People were desperate for a vaccine," Nichols said. "We have effective vaccines now, and so what strikes me in the comparison, if you think about this milestone, this tragedy of deaths, is that same number but we have a really effective treatment, the thing that they most wanted in 1918 and '19, we've got. And for a lot of different reasons, we botched the response."In this Aug. 13, 2021, file photo, a patient is unloaded from an ambulance, after Memphis Fire Chief Gina Sweat said that emergency services were overwhelmed by numbers of COVID-19 patients and that wait times should be expected.Karen Pulfer Focht/Reuters, FILESimilar to the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, no vaccines or treatments were available to protect people against the 1918 influenza. Thus, protection through non-pharmaceutical interventions was critical, Mooney said."The same kinds of measures -- the so-called non-pharmaceutical interventions that were put on in 1918 -- were the same that we saw last year: lockdowns, social distancing, hygiene masks, limits on gathering places," Nichols said.In fact, social distancing was also one of the great historical lessons learned from 1918, according to Markel, demonstrating that if done early, and for a long time, such measures can work.Millions of different communities and demographics affectedOne fundamental contrast between the two pandemics, according to Markel, is that different age groups were most significantly impacted. A disproportionate number of those who succumbed to the disease in 1918 were in the 18- to 45-year-old age group. Young children and the elderly were also significantly impacted.However, in the coronavirus pandemic, the age group that has been the most affected is over the age of 65, who make up 78.7% of virus-related deaths.MORE: FDA panel recommends Pfizer boosters for people 65 and older or high risk, votes 'no' for general populationHistorical evidence suggests that racial and ethnic disparities, which have affected communities of color throughout the coronavirus pandemic, were also present during the 1918 pandemic.Black Americans had higher case fatality rates from influenza in 1918-19 than whites, according to a 2019 study in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.A masked nurse at the head of a row of beds treats patients during the influenza pandemic at Walter Reed Hospital, in Washington D.C., 1918.Universal Images Group via Getty ImagesSimilarly, Black Americans account for nearly 14% of COVID-19 related deaths, despite the fact that Black Americans only account for 12.5% of the population.Becoming endemicDomestically and globally, experts said, it will be crucial for vaccine uptake to increase, in order to blunt the impact of the coronavirus death toll."I'm a little pessimistic going into winter, given the fact that there's such a large unvaccinated population that it is a lot like 1918," Nichols said, adding that it will ultimately be "some combination of getting more of the population immune, with vaccines and with infections."Ultimately, although "it's not the worst of all time, it's pretty darn close," Markel said of the COVID-19 pandemic.

This requirement is for all employees regardless of work location. If you have a valid medical, religious, or personal reason that prohibits you from receiving an influenza vaccination, you may submit an influenza vaccine medical waiver or influenza vaccine religious belief or personal conviction waiver. The 2021 waivers are not yet available but will be released when they are. As an SMPH employee, you must provide proof of vaccination or have a completed waiver on file by Monday December 6, 2021. Waivers do need to be re-filed annually — this is a change from previous years. If you receive your vaccine at a UHS clinic, then your information is automatically reported, and you do not need to submit documentation. However, if you receive your shot through any other avenue, you must submit proof. Proof of vaccination and waivers may be sent to: Email: hr-compliance@med.wisc.edu Fax: (608) 262-9515 Mail: 750 Highland Avenue Health Sciences Learning Center Room 4150 – Attn: Flu Madison, WI 53705 Examples of proof of vaccination include: Screenshot from your MyChart WI Immunization Registry record Walgreens receipt Note from doctor SMPH will not be holding its own clinics in HSLC this year. The school is partnering with University Health Services to provide safe options for all employees to obtain their annual influenza vaccine. All UHS clinics have ended. Employees still in need of a flu shot will need to receive it elsewhere and submit proper documentation. Please note: These clinics do not offer any services related to tuberculosis (TB). If you are required to fulfill a TB compliance requirement for your UW Health appointment, please look for communication from UW Health about resources for completing the requirement. Dually-employed faculty who are additionally employed by UW Health can also attend a UW Health Clinic, and their information will be automatically reported. More information about these are located on U-Connect. If you are dually-employed by UW Health and SMPH: Send your documentation to hremployeehealth@uwhealth.org. UW Health HR will share it with the SMPH HR compliance team for our records. (If you happen to send it to SMPH HR by mistake, we will in turn share it with UW Health.) If you are singly employed by UW Health: Send your documentation to hremployeehealth@uwhealth.org. Employees should bring their insurance card. If you do not have proof of insurance, you can still receive a flu shot at no cost at a UHS clinic.

The proportion of comorbid condition to human influenza A pneumonia was 58%, lower than B pneumonia and H7N9 pneumonia patients (78% vs. 77.8%; p = 0.013). The proportion of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), lymphocytopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase to hospitalized human influenza A-related viral pneumonia patients was higher than B pneumonia patients (p < 0.05), but lower than H7N9 pneumonia patients (p < 0.05). In the multivariate analysis, pulmonary consolidation (odds ratio (OR): 13.67; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.54–121.12; p = 0.019) and positive bacterial culture (sputum) (OR: 7.71; 95% CI 2.48–24.03; p < 0.001) were independently associated with IMV, while shock (OR: 13.16; 95% CI 2.06–84.07; p = 0.006), white blood cell count > 10,000/mm3 (OR: 7.22; 95% CI 1.47–35.58; p = 0.015) and positive bacterial culture(blood or sputum) (OR: 6.27; 95% CI 1.36–28.85; p = 0.018) were independently associated with death in the three types hospitalized influenza-related viral pneumonia patients.ConclusionsHospital influenza B-related viral pneumonia mainly affects the elderly and people with underlying diseases, while human influenza A pneumonia mainly affects the young adults; however, the mortality was similar. The hospitalized human influenza A-related viral pneumonia patients was severer than B pneumonia patients, but milder than H7N9 pneumonia patients. Pulmonary consolidation and positive bacterial culture (sputum) were independently associated with IMV, while shock, white blood cell count > 10,000/mm3, and positive bacterial culture (blood or sputum) were independently associated with death to three types hospitalized influenza-related viral pneumonia patients. Peer Review reports BackgroundInfluenza causes considerable morbidity during each annual influenza season. In April 2009, the influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 (pH1N1) virus emerged in Mexico and the USA and spread globally [1]. Since the first report of pneumonia that was caused by the pH1N1 virus in Mexico [2], severe cases have been documented worldwide. Influenza B virus has been classically considered less pathogenic than influenza A virus in adults and mostly responsible for mild respiratory infections, while severe illness and poor prognosis have been associated with bacterial coinfection [3, 4]. On March 30, 2013, three individuals with severe pneumonia were found to be infected with a novel avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus that had not been detected in humans and animals previously. As of May 9, 2013, 131 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported, including 32 deaths [5], and the majority of these patients were reported in China.The comparison of the demographic, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics of hospital human influenza (influenza A (H1N1) pdm09, H3N2, and B)-related and hospitalized avian-origin influenza A (H7N9)-related viral pneumonia patients has not been reported. 2017–2018 influenza season was dominated by pH1N1 and B viruses along with co-circulation of H3N2 virus, this season provided a unique opportunity to directly compare the demographic, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics of hospitalized human influenza A (pH1N1 and H3N2)-related viral pneumonia patients to the hospital influenza B-related viral pneumonia patients. Also, we compared the demographic, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics of these hospitalized human influenza (pH1N1, H3N2, and B)-related viral pneumonia patients to the hospital H7N9-related viral pneumonia patients in 2017, and aimed to discover the factors independently associated with invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or death among these three types hospitalized influenza-related viral pneumonia patients.MethodsStudy design and study populationA retrospective study was conducted from November 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018 at the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, China. All patients, > 14 years of age and with hospital stay > 24 h with confirmed human influenza A or B-related viral pneumonia were included in this study. In addition to above factors, those with confirmed H7N9-related viral pneumonia from January 1, 2017 to May 3, 2017 were also included. This study was approved by the Ethical Board of the hospital.This retrospective study evaluated the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and computed tomography results daily in hospitalized patients with confirmed human influenza A- or B-related viral pneumonia or H7N9-related viral pneumonia. These cases were assessed by an Infectious Disease doctor and nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) or sputum specimens were collected within the first 24 h of hospitalization and processed immediately. Influenza-related viral pneumonia was defined as confirmed human influenza A or B or H7N9 virus infection and the presence of a new infiltrate on computed tomography plus fever or respiratory symptoms. All radiological evaluations were performed by two radiologists who were blinded to the clinical information.Data collection and definitionsClinical data were acquired from electronic medical records. The following variables were recorded: demographics, comorbid conditions, current smoking status, alcohol abuse, pregnancy, body mass index (BMI), clinical feature, laboratory data, radiographic finding, complication, treatment, and clinical outcome. The definitions of obesity, current smoking status, alcohol abuse, confirmed human influenza A or B, confirmed H7N9, lymphocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, immunosuppression, early antiviral therapy, exposure to live poultry and severe cases were provided in Additional file 1.Statistical analysisCategorical variables were compared by the Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test. Continuous variables were compared by the t-test or the Mann–Whitney test. The multivariate logistic regression analysis of factors potentially associated with IMV or in-hospital mortality included the variables that were significant in the univariate analysis and clinically important variables. Statistical significance was established at p-value < 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS v.18. (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).ResultsDemographic and epidemiological characteristicsFrom November 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018, a total of 4297 cases of laboratory-confirmed human influenza A and B viral infection were reported in our hospital. Of these, 2335 cases were human influenza A (about 85% were pH1N1 and 15% were H3N2), 1880 cases were influenza B, and 82 cases were infected with both viruses. Finally, 138 cases of hospitalized human influenza A-related viral pneumonia and 59 cases of hospitalized influenza B-related viral pneumonia were included in this study. From January 1, 2017 to May 3, 2017, a total of 18 cases of hospitalized H7N9-related viral pneumonia were also included in the current study. The median age of hospitalized human influenza A-related viral pneumonia patients was lower than those with B pneumonia (57 years (interquartile range (IQR), 45.8–66.3) vs. 62 years (IQR, 53–74); p = 0.034). In the 35–49-year-old age group, the proportion of hospitalized human influenza A-related viral pneumonia patients was 23.9%, which was higher than B pneumonia patients (10.2%; p = 0.027). In the ≥ 65-year-old group, the proportion of hospitalized human influenza A-related viral pneumonia patients was 32.6%, which was relatively lower than B pneumonia patients (45.8%; p = 0.079; Table 1). The proportion of comorbid conditions in hospitalized human influenza A-related viral pneumonia patients was 58%, which was lower than the B pneumonia patients and hospitalized H7N9 pneumonia patients (78% vs. 77.8%; p = 0.013). Interestingly, 66.7% of hospitalized H7N9-related viral pneumonia patients were exposed to live poultry.Table 1 Comparison of demographic and epidemiological characteristics of three types hospitalized influenza-related viral pneumonia patientsFull size tableClinical characteristics and diagnostic findingsThe most common symptoms of the three types of hospital influenza-related viral pneumonia patients were fever, cough, sputum production, shortness of breath, and fatigue (Table 2).Table 2 Comparison of clinical characteristics of three types hospitalized influenza-related viral pneumonia patientsFull size tableAt the time of admission, the proportion of lymphocytopenia in hospitalized human influenza A-related viral pneumonia patients was 83.3%, higher than B pneumonia patients (69.5%; p = 0.028). The proportion of elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in hospitalized human influenza A-related viral pneumonia patients was higher than that of B pneumonia patients (46.7% vs. 25.9%, p = 0.007; 67.9% vs. 51%, p = 0.033). The median value of lymphocyte count in hospitalized H7N9-related viral pneumonia patients was 425/mm3 (IQR: 375–625), lower than human influenza A and B pneumonia patients (745/mm3 (IQR: 448–1208) vs. 1020/mm3 (IQR: 550–1690); p = 0.001). The proportion of lymphocytopenia in hospitalized H7N9-related viral pneumonia patients was 100.0%, higher than human influenza A and B pneumonia patients (83.3% vs. 69.5%; p = 0.006). The proportion of elevated AST, creatine kinase (CK), DD, and LDH in hospitalized H7N9-related viral pneumonia patients was higher than human influenza A and B pneumonia patients (77.8% vs. 46.7% vs. 25.9%, p < 0.001; 76.5% vs. 17.9% vs. 9.8%, p < 0.001; 94.4% vs. 76.5% vs. 62.5%, p = 0.016; 100% vs. 67.9% vs. 51%, p = 0.001). The proportion of positive culture (blood or sputum) on presentation or during hospitalization in the hospitalized H7N9-related viral pneumonia patients (bacterial) was 61.1%, higher than the human influenza A and B pneumonia patients (21.1% vs. 21.3%; p = 0.002).Complications, treatment, and clinical outcomesIn the current study, the proportion of intensive care unit (ICU) admission in hospitalized human influenza A-related viral pneumonia patients was 19.6%, which higher than 6.8% of B pneumonia patients (p = 0.024). The proportion of IMV in hospitalized human influenza A-related viral pneumonia patients was 16.7%, which also higher than that in B pneumonia patients 3.4% (p = 0.01) (Table 3). The proportion of IMV in hospitalized H7N9-related viral pneumonia patients was 38.9%, which was higher than that in human influenza A and B pneumonia patients (16.7% vs. 3.4%; p = 0.001). The median value of hospital expense of hospitalized H7N9-related viral pneumonia patients was 66,095.6 Yuan (IQR, 42,450.6–129,574.2), which was higher than that of human influenza A and B pneumonia patients (IQR, 25,642.3 Yuan (13,184.5–53,805.7) vs. 18,316.8 Yuan (IQR, 11,111.1–35,750.5); p < 0.001). There was no difference in death to three types of hospitalized influenza-related viral pneumonia patients.Table 3 Comparison of complications, treatment, and clinical outcomes of three types hospitalized influenza-related viral pneumonia patientsFull size tableIn the treatment, the rate of glucocorticoid use in hospitalized H7N9-related viral pneumonia patients was 100%, which was higher than human influenza A and B pneumonia patients (55.8% vs. 40.7%; p < 0.001). All the hospitalized human influenza A-related viral pneumonia patients and hospitalized influenza B-related viral pneumonia patients were treated with oseltamivir or peramivir or both, and all the hospitalized H7N9-related viral pneumonia patients were treated with a combination of oseltamivir with peramivir. However, the time from onset of illness to administration of antiviral therapy in hospitalized H7N9-related viral pneumonia patients was 4 days (IQR, 3–8.3), which was relatively shorter than that of human influenza A and B pneumonia patients (7 days (IQR, 5–10.8) vs. 6 days (range, 3–14); p = 0.089). The time of administration of antiviral therapy to virus-negative time of hospitalized H7N9-related viral pneumonia patients was 5.5 days (IQR, 2.8–10), shorter than human influenza A and B pneumonia patients (10 days (IQR, 6–14.5) vs. 11 days (IQR, 6–17.75); p = 0.007).Factors associated with IMV due to three types hospitalized influenza-related viral pneumonia patientsIn the univariate analysis, the three types hospitalized influenza-related viral pneumonia patients with IMV had significantly higher neutrophil percentage, C-reactive protein, AST, DD, blood urea nitrogen, pro-B-type natriuretic peptides, and partial pressure arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2:FiO2) levels than the three types hospitalized influenza-related viral pneumonia patients without IMV. Furthermore, the proportion of patients with shortness of breaths, lymphocytopenia, elevated procalcitonin, AST, CK, DD, and LDH, positive bacterial culture (sputum) on presentation or during hospitalization, positive bacterial culture (blood or sputum) on presentation or during hospitalization, CURB-65 score ≥ 2, bilateral pneumonia, and pulmonary consolidation in the three types of hospitalized influenza-related viral pneumonia patients with IMV was significantly higher than those without IMV, while the lymphocyte count in the three types of pneumonia patients with IMV was lower than those without IMV (Additional file 2: Table S1). In the multivariate analysis, pulmonary consolidation (odds ratio (OR): 13.67; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.54–121.12; p = 0.019) and positive bacterial culture (sputum) at the time of presentation or during hospitalization (OR: 7.71; 95% CI 2.48–24.03; p < 0.001) were independently associated with IMV in the three types hospitalized influenza-related viral pneumonia patients (Additional file 4: Table S3).Factors associated with death due to the three types hospitalized influenza-related viral pneumonia patientsIn the univariate analysis, the three types of hospitalized influenza-related viral pneumonia patients who die in the hospital had significantly higher neutrophil percentage, hemoglobin, blood platelet counts, C-reactive protein, DD, blood urea nitrogen, pro-B-type natriuretic peptides, and PaO2:FiO2 levels than the survivors. Also, the proportion of elevated white blood cell count and procalcitonin, positive bacterial culture (sputum) on presentation or during hospitalization, CURB-65 score ≥ 2, IMV, shock to the three types hospitalized influenza-related viral pneumonia patients who die in the hospital was significantly higher than that of the survivors (Additional file 3: Table S2). In the multivariate analysis, shock (OR: 13.16; 95% CI 2.06–84.07; p = 0.006), white blood cell count > 10,000/mm3 (OR: 7.22; 95% CI 1.47–35.58; p = 0.015) and positive bacterial culture (blood or sputum) on presentation or during hospitalization (OR: 6.27; 95% CI 1.36–28.85; p = 0.018) were independently associated with death in the three types hospitalized influenza-related viral pneumonia patients (Table 4).Table 4 Multivariate analysis of factors associated with death due to three types hospitalized influenza-related viral pneumonia patientsFull size tableDiscussionThis was the first study that compared the demographic, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics of hospitalized human influenza-related viral pneumonia patients with H7N9 pneumonia patients. The study revealed that the hospitalized human influenza A-related viral pneumonia patients were younger than those with B pneumonia, and the infection was primarily detected in young adults. On the other hand, the influenza B-related viral pneumonia was common in the elderly, usually with comorbid conditions. Hospitalized human influenza A-related viral pneumonia patients was severer than B pneumonia patients, but milder than H7N9 pneumonia patients.The proportion of patients who have at least one comorbid condition in those with human influenza A-related viral pneumonia was lower than those with B pneumonia and H7N9 pneumonia patients. Moreover, the average age of hospitalized human influenza A-related viral pneumonia patients was lower than that of B pneumonia patients, and the proportion of the hospitalized human influenza A-related viral pneumonia patients in the 35–49 age group was more than that of the B pneumonia patients, and the proportion in the ≥ 65 years age group was relatively less than that of the B pneumonia patients. Some studies have reported that influenza B mainly affects the elderly and people with underlying diseases [6, 7]; however, pH1N1 mainly affects young adults, similar to our research. Early-life exposure to an antigenically related virus, i.e., the A (H1N1) strain that circulated after the 1918 pandemic and prior to the 1957 A (H2N2) pandemic might mitigate the severity for the pH1N1 strain in older individuals; this phenomenon explained the survival of elderly in the pandemic. In China, the old people retire at 60 years of age and have more opportunities to shop in live-animal markets, therefore more likely to be exposed to the live-poultry, it can partially explain why the H7N9 patients have more comorbid conditions.In the aspect of clinical characteristics and diagnostic findings, CK was designated as a biomarker of severity in pH1N1 infection; the elevation of CK was associated with complications, increased length of ICU stay, and healthcare resources [8]. Another study included 155 hospitalized adult patients with pH1N1; LDH was an independent risk factor of hospital death as assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis [9]. The elevation of DD may be caused by the embolism of the small pulmonary vessels, then the pulmonary ventilation and blood flow ratio became abnormal, and the blood oxygen saturation declined. Finally, the rate of mortality was elevated; however, this hypothesis needs further substantiation. A lymphocyte count of < 300 lymphocytes/μL was observed in a subgroup of patients with poor outcome in a study encompassing 239 inpatients with confirmed influenza virus infection [10]. Thus, we can conclude that the proportion of elevated CK, LDH, DD, and lymphocytopenia was positively relative to the severity of influenza. In this study, the elevated LDH and lymphocytopenia in hospitalized human influenza A-related viral pneumonia patients was higher than that in B pneumonia patients, and the elevated CK, LDH, DD, and lymphocytopenia in hospitalized H7N9-related viral pneumonia patients was higher than that in human influenza A and B pneumonia patients. The proportion of ICU admission and invasive mechanical ventilation in hospitalized human influenza A-related viral pneumonia patients was higher than that in B pneumonia patients. The proportion of IMV and the median value of hospitalization expense in hospitalized H7N9-related viral pneumonia patients were higher than that in human influenza A and B pneumonia patients. Taken together, it can be concluded that the hospitalized human influenza A-related viral pneumonia patients was severer than B pneumonia patients, but milder than H7N9 pneumonia patients. A study consisting of 57 cases of H7N9 patients and 14 cases of pH1N1 patients demonstrated that the proportion of acute respiratory distress syndrome to H7N9 was much higher than that of pH1N1 [11], which was also observed in the current study. Furthermore, the proportion of ICU admission and IMV to pH1N1 was twofold higher than that of B, and no difference was detected in the mortality as reported by a study including 2791 cases of adult patients [12]. Another study reported that the mortality of adults influenza B patients was similar to that of pH1N1 patients [13]. Although all the influenza viruses infect the respiratory epithelium from the nasal passages to bronchioles, pH1N1 tends to infect pneumocytes and interalveolar macrophages, causing extensive areas of inflammation in the alveoli, which could partially explain the increased severity of pH1N1 [14,15,16,17]. Hospitalized influenza B-related viral pneumonia mainly affects the elderly and those with underlying diseases, rendering them as severe cases, such that the mortality of B pneumonia patients was elevated and similar to human influenza A pneumonia patients. Hypercytokinemia is characterized by the over-production of various proinflammatory cytokines and plays an significant role in disease severity and mortality in H5N1 patients [18]. Compared with pH1N1 infection, H7N9 virus infection tends to induce higher cytokine expression, resembling the cytokine storm observed in H5N1 infection [19], which could partially explain why the H7N9 infection was severer than pH1N1.The World Health Organization Guidelines recommended that prompt empirical antiviral treatment should be initiated when influenza is suspected, even before laboratory results are known [20]. Improved clinical outcomes have been described among adults treated with antiviral drugs after hospitalization or up to 5 days from illness onset [21,22,23]. Early antiviral therapy within 2 days of illness accelerated viral shedding and reduced the mortality in patients with H7N9 viral infection [24]. Moreover, compared to early antiviral therapy, H7N9 patients with delayed antiviral therapy became severe cases [25]. Interestingly, in a study comprising of 82 cases of H7N9 virus infection, the time of onset of illness to administration of antiviral therapy was 6 days (IQR: 4–8), longer than that in the current study 4 days (IQR:3–8.3), and the administration of antiviral therapy to virus-negative time of the study was 7 days (IQR: 5–9), also longer than 5.5 days (IQR: 2.8–10) in the current study; the mortality was 34.1% [26]. Gao et al. [27] reported that the rate of glucocorticoid use of the H7N9 cases was 62.2%, lower than our study 100% and the mortality was 27%. The mortality of hospitalized H7N9-related viral pneumonia patients was much higher than that of human influenza A and B pneumonia. However, in the current study, the mortality of hospitalized H7N9-related viral pneumonia patients was lower than before and similar to human influenza A and B pneumonia. This phenomenon might be explicated by the initial antiviral time relatively early than before and the rate of glucocorticoid use for H7N9 was high. All our patients received oseltamivir with peramivir that also may reduce the mortality, although these findings need to be substantiated further. In the current study, the proportion of early antiviral therapy in the three types of hospitalized influenza-related viral pneumonia patients was similar.Nevertheless, the present study has several limitations. First, influenza testing was ordered at the physicians’ discretion, and therefore, not all individuals with influenza were tested, or testing could be biased towards severe cases. However, this bias would not affect our main findings because influenza testing was ordered independently of the knowledge of the virus type or subtype. Second, we only included the hospitalized influenza-related viral pneumonia patients and excluded the outpatient cases and hospitalized patients without influenza-related viral pneumonia, such that it cannot reflect the whole disease spectrum. Finally, because the RT-PCR was not accurate absolutely, the real influenza-positive patients may be diagnosed as negative.ConclusionIn summary, hospitalized influenza B-related viral pneumonia mainly affects the elderly and individuals with underlying diseases, while human influenza A pneumonia mainly affects the young adults; however, the mortality was comparative. The hospitalized human influenza A-related viral pneumonia patients was severer than B pneumonia patients, but milder than H7N9 pneumonia patients. Pulmonary consolidation and positive bacterial culture (sputum) at the time of presentation or during hospitalization were independently associated with IMV due to three types of hospital influenza-related viral pneumonia patients. On the other hand, shock, white blood cell count > 10,000/mm3, and positive bacterial culture (blood or sputum) at the time of presentation or during hospitalization were associated with death in such patients.

Influenza killed one in 150 Americans, while one in 500 people have died from the coronavirus Elizabeth Gamillo Correspondent September 24, 2021 The 1918 flu, also known as the Spanish flu, spread worldwide during 1918 and 1919. In the U.S. it was first identified in military personnel in the spring of 1918 and mostly affected younger populations less than five years old, between 20 to 40 years old and those 65 years of age or older. Navy Medicine via Wikicommons under CC BY 2.0 The coronavirus pandemic has become the deadliest disease outbreak in recent American history with tolls surpassing the estimated deaths of the 1918 flu. According to data from Johns Hopkins University, 681,253 individuals in the United States have died from Covid-19 infections, while over a century ago, the country lost an estimated 675,000 people during the 1918 influenza pandemic, reports Holly Yan for CNN. Many health experts suspect that the Covid-19 pandemic’s high death tolls are a result of America’s insufficient response to control the pandemic early on—despite modern day scientific and medical advances—and consider the phenomenon a tragedy, reports Carla K. Johnson for the Associated Press. Currently, an average of 1,900 deaths are reported per day in the U.S. Experts suspect the recent surge is due in part to the persistence of the deadlier Delta variant, reports CNBC’s Berkeley Lovelace Jr. “It’s generally known around the world that America didn’t do a very good job in the early stages of controlling the pandemic,” says David Morens, a medical historian at the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, to Helen Branswell for STAT News. The 1918 flu, also known as the Spanish flu, spread worldwide during 1918 and 1919. In the U.S., it was first identified in military personnel in the spring of 1918 and mostly affected children less than five years old, adults between 20 to 40 years old, and seniors 65 years of age or older. Mortality rate was high in healthy people between 20 and 40 years old, making this a unique and devastating feature of the influenza virus, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. When looking at two separate pandemics that occurred in different time periods, understanding the context of all technological, medical, cultural, and social advances that occurred over the past century is important, reports CNBC. American population numbers were vastly different. In 1918, the population was less than a third of today's at 103 million people living in U.S. right before the 1920s. Now, there are 303 million people living in the country. So, while the 1918 flu killed one in every 150 Americans, Covid-19 has killed one in 500 people so far, per CNBC. Globally, Covid-19 has taken the lives of 4.7 million people, whereas the 1918 pandemic killed an estimated 20 million to 50 million people. When looking at the national population-level data during the two events, the 1918 influenza still tops Covid-19, per Stat News. Medicine was also not as advanced during 1918, and a vaccine against influenza was not available, according to CNN. To control infections a century ago, non-pharmaceutical interventions—like isolation, quarantine, use of disinfectants, cloth masks and limits of public gatherings—were enforced, according to the CDC. However, Covid-19 cases are still rising despite the availability of vaccines, and other modern medicine practices. Currently, millions of Americans have still not been vaccinated, per CNN. “Remember, we’re still counting,” Morens tells STAT News. “In 1918, the pandemic became not so deadly within two years. We have no idea — I don’t, and I don’t trust anybody who says they do — where this Covid-19 will go.” Epidemiologist Stephen Kissler from the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health suggests that another reason for high rates of Covid-19 infection is from the misinformation that spread through the internet, per CNN. “The truth is we have no historical precedent for the moment we’re in now,” writes Howard Markel, the director of the Center for History of Medicine at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, last month in the Atlantic. “We need to stop thinking back to 1918 as a guide for how to act in the present and to start thinking forward from 2021 as a guide to how to act in the future.” Get the latest stories in your inbox every weekday.

Sep 22nd 2021ShareIN SEPTEMBER 2020 doctors and public-health officials in the northern hemisphere were on high alert. They did not know how covid-19 would behave in the first winter of the pandemic. Respiratory viruses tend to surge during cold weather. And there were the usual concerns about influenza, the shape-shifting virus that sickens and kills many people every year. At worst, doctors feared they would see simultaneous outbreaks of covid-19 and flu which would overwhelm hospitals and send deaths soaring—a “twindemic”.This article appeared in the International section of the print edition under the headline “Northern exposure”International September 25th 2021Measures to prevent the spread of covid-19 have also fended off fluFrom the September 25th 2021 editionDiscover stories from this section and more in the list of contentsExplore the editionShareReuse this contentDiscover moreThe world faces its worst trade wars since the 1930sDonald Trump’s re-election accelerates a crisis for globalisationAmerica’s allies brace for brinkmanship, deals—and betrayalFrom Ukraine to Israel there is a frantic scramble to flatter and sway Donald TrumpWhat the world thinks of Trump, Ukraine and Chinese supremacyA new poll of 30,000 people worldwide has some surprising resultsA surprise new twist in Putin’s currency warsThe BIS ditches a new payments platform the Kremlin wants to mimicIntrigue, greed and hostility burn in the Antarctic If you thought its freezing icescapes would escape a world on fire, think againThe Telegram: our new guide to a dangerous worldThe old order is dying.

Edward A. "Doc" Rogers/Library of Congress via AP The Covid-19 pandemic has become the deadliest disease event in American history, with a death toll surpassing that of the 1918 Spanish flu. The Spanish flu was previously the disease event that caused the biggest loss of life in the United States; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 675,000 Americans died during the 1918 pandemic, in waves of illness that stretched out over roughly two years in this country.advertisement According to STAT’s Covid-19 Tracker, Covid deaths stand at more than 675,400. “In terms of raw numbers of deaths, that’s a high number,” said Howard Markel, director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. “And it’s higher still than it should have been, frankly.” U.S. deaths make up roughly 14% of the nearly 4.7 million fatalities that have been reported worldwide in this pandemic to date, even though the country’s population comprises only about 4.2% of the global population.advertisement “In the U.S., we are among the worst affected in our class of countries — rich countries with an aging population. But other countries in Europe did poorly as well,” said Cécile Viboud, an infectious diseases epidemiologist who has done a lot of research into deaths from the 1918 flu. Newsletters Sign up for Daily Recap A roundup of STAT's top stories of the day. Please enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy Whether the Covid pandemic will qualify as the deadliest event in U.S. history is perhaps a question for Civil War historians. The long-accepted toll of the War Between the States was 620,000, which this pandemic has already surpassed. But in 2011, David Hacker, a historian at Binghamton University in New York State, published an article in the journal Civil War History arguing the true number of deaths in the Civil War was more likely around 750,000. The heavy toll the pandemic has taken in the U.S. is due to the country’s inadequate response early on, said Markel. David Morens, a medical historian at the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, agreed. “I think it’s generally known around the world that America didn’t do a very good job in the early stages of controlling the pandemic,” said Morens, who has also written extensively on the 1918 flu pandemic. Comparing events that happened more than a century apart has its perils. For instance, the population of the United States in 1918 was a third of what it is now. So as a percentage of the national population, the Spanish flu deaths still has the lead on Covid-19. Related: FDA advisory panel recommends booster doses of Covid-19 vaccine only for older and high-risk Americans Likewise, the mean age of the people who died in 1918 was 28, whereas with Covid, deaths are occurring mainly in the elderly, said Viboud, who works at the National Institutes of Health’s Fogerty International Center. In terms of cumulative years of life lost, the Spanish flu’s impact thus remains greater. But modern medicine is far more advanced than what was available in 1918. Now people whose lungs are under attack from Covid can be put on ventilators or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation — ECMO — machines, which pump oxygen into blood when a person’s heart and lungs are no longer up to the job. These were not options in 1918. And for months now, the country has had vaccines that are highly effective at lowering the risk of dying from Covid. Still the fatalities pile up, though at a slower rate than earlier in the pandemic. “We have no idea what would have been the impact of Covid-19 without interventions,” Viboud acknowledged. Related: FDA vaccine regulators argue against Covid-19 vaccine boosters in new international review The deaths will continue to climb for some time still, Morens noted. “Remember, we’re still counting,” he said. “In 1918, the pandemic became not so deadly within two years. We have no idea — I don’t and I don’t trust anybody who says they do — where this Covid-19 will go.” The global Covid death figure is without doubt an underestimate, but then again, the American tally likely is as well. “The true deaths from Covid-19 in the United States are probably higher than the actual numbers. But how much higher is a matter of speculation,” Morens said. Related: How the Delta variant’s remarkable ability to replicate threw new twists into the Covid-19 pandemic There is some work that suggests what a truer figure might be, Viboud said, pointing to a research paper published in the journal eLife in June. The study, by Ariel Karlinsky, an economist and statistician at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and Dmitry Kobak, of the Institute for Ophthalmic Research at the University of Tübingen in Germany, actually attempted to estimate a more accurate picture of Covid deaths in 103 countries. Their calculations were based on looking at what is known as excess mortality, the differences between the number of deaths reported since the start of the pandemic and the annual average mortality figures for the years 2015 through 2019 in each of the countries studied. Some countries have actually had fewer deaths — negative excess mortality — during the pandemic. One such country is New Zealand, which has managed in the main to keep Covid from spreading by using stringent border controls. New Zealand reported 1,900 fewer deaths than normal during the pandemic, the Karlinsky and Kobak paper reported, attributing the lower number of deaths to the fact that viruses like influenza haven’t circulated to normal degrees during the pandemic. Trending Now: What can Trump and RFK Jr. actually do on health care? Their work estimated that the true Covid death toll in the United States is probably 10% higher than the declared number of lives lost to the disease in the country. That would place the Covid deaths in America in the ballpark of 741,000. In rivaling the Spanish flu, the Covid-19 pandemic has given medical historians a new lesson to teach, said Markel, who wrote about that fact last month in The Atlantic. “The truth is we have no historical precedent for the moment we’re in now,” he wrote. “We need to stop thinking back to 1918 as a guide for how to act in the present and to start thinking forward from 2021 as a guide to how to act in the future.” Related: Comparing the Covid-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson In his interview with STAT, Markel recalled that during a briefing he gave to former President Barack Obama about the 1918 pandemic — he was president during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic — Obama noted that 1918 was a long time ago. That’s the problem with disease outbreaks that are 100-year events; they are so rare that the lessons one can take from them may seem out of date when they are next needed. “We finally now have a modern pandemic,” said Markel. “In modern times with modern vaccines and so on. So to me, this is the one I’m going to be teaching my medical students and public health students.” This story has been updated.

Creative CommonsSeptember 24, 2021UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — Penn State University Health Services (UHS), a unit of Student Affairs, will host two flu vaccine clinics for University Park students this fall. Both clinics will take place in the HUB-Robeson Center, on Sept. 30 in Heritage Hall and Oct. 25 in Alumni Hall, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Students can schedule their appointment now for either clinic. Appointments must be scheduled in advance through myUHS; walk-in appointments are not available. The flu vaccination is covered by most health insurances, but resources are available for students who have concerns about the cost. Students can reach out to the UHS case manager at 814-863-0774 for more information. Before coming to their appointment, students must complete all required forms in myUHS, upload their health insurance card, and bring their student ID with them to the visit. UHS will administer the Fluarix Quadrivalent flu vaccine, which is thimerosal-free and latex-free. #FightFluPSU is an annual campaign run by University Health Services to help raise awareness among students about the importance of getting the flu shot and grant Penn State students free flu vaccines. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. If not treated, it can result in mild to severe illness and, at times, cause death. “There are many reasons to get an influenza (flu) vaccination yearly,” said Valerie Fulton, UHS infectious disease manager. “Per the CDC, flu vaccination is the best way to safeguard yourself, your friends and your family members against flu and its potentially serious complications.” Fulton said the flu vaccine's benefits include the following: It can help keep you from getting sick with the flu. It reduces the severity of illness in people who get vaccinated but still become sick. It reduces the risk of flu-associated hospitalization and is a preventive tool for people with certain chronic health conditions. It may protect people around you, including those who are more vulnerable to serious flu illness, such as babies, young children and older adults.

However, an extensive reticence to be inoculated, fueled in part by baseless fears about safety and efficacy, means that 36% of people in the US aged 12 and over have yet to be fully vaccinated, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).“Big pockets of American society – and, worse, their leaders – have thrown this away,” said Dr Howard Markel a medical historian at the University of Michigan.The White House initially forecast 100,000 to 240,000 deaths from Covid-19, if people socially distanced. Donald Trump, who erroneously predicted the coronavirus would simply vanish, oversaw the lower end of this forecast being reached in May last year, the latter death toll arriving in November.A surge in deaths in the spring of 2020 was surpassed by a larger wave of deaths over winter, with a record 4,197 people dying on a single day, 13 January, according to Johns Hopkins University. Since Joe Biden became president, the rollout of vaccines has helped push the rate of deaths down, although it started climbing again in August due to the spread of the Delta variant.The true death toll may be much higher than the official total because, like the previous pandemic, it is estimated. Also similar to the 1918-19 flu, the coronavirus may never entirely disappear. Scientists hope it will become a mild seasonal bug as human immunity strengthens through vaccination and repeated infection.View image in fullscreenMedical staff care for people with influenza at an emergency tent hospital in Brookline, Massachusetts, in October 1918. Photograph: Everett/Rex/Shutterstock“We hope it will be like getting a cold, but there’s no guarantee,” said Rustom Antia, a biologist at Emory University, suggesting an optimistic scenario in which this could happen over a few years.For now, the pandemic still has the US and other parts of the world firmly in its jaws.While the Delta variant-fueled surge in infections may have peaked, US deaths are more than 1,900 a day on average – the highest level since early March – and the overall toll topped 675,000 on Monday, according to the count kept by Johns Hopkins.Winter may bring a new surge, with the University of Washington’s influential model projecting an additional 100,000 or so Covid-19 deaths by 1 January, which would bring the overall US toll to 776,000.View image in fullscreenA nurse cares for a patient in the influenza ward of Walter Reed hospital in Washington in 1918.

Global deaths from Covid-19 stand at more than 4.6 million.The 1918-19 flu’s US death toll is a rough guess, given incomplete records of the era and the poor scientific understanding of what caused the illness. The 675,000 figure comes from the CDC.Before Covid-19, the 1918-19 flu was universally considered the worst pandemic in history. Whether the current scourge ultimately proves deadlier is unclear.In many ways, the 1918-19 flu – which was wrongly named Spanish flu because it first received widespread news coverage in Spain – was worse. Spread by the mobility of the first world war, it killed young, healthy adults in vast numbers. No vaccine existed and there were no antibiotics to treat secondary infections.View image in fullscreenVolunteers with the Red Cross hand out flu masks at a table in San Francisco in 1918.

The nation is currently experiencing yet another wave of new infections, fueled by the fast-spreading delta variant.The 1918 flu – which came in three waves, occurring in the spring of 1918, the fall of 1918; and the winter and spring of 1919 – killed an estimated 675,000 Americans, according to the Centers for the Disease Control and Prevention. It was considered America's most lethal pandemic in recent history up until now.watch nowVIDEO5:3605:36Covid vaccine for kids could be available by end of October: GottliebSquawk Box"I think we are now pretty well done with historical comparisons," said Dr. Howard Markel, a physician and medical historian at the University of Michigan.

Today, there are nearly 330 million people living in the U.S. That means the 1918 flu killed about 1 in every 150 Americans, compared with 1 in 500 who have died from Covid so far.The 1918 virus also tended to kill differently than Covid, experts say. With World War I, there was a massive movement of men across all of America and Europe. While the coronavirus can be especially severe for the elderly and those with underlying health conditions, the 1918 virus was unusual in that it killed many young adults.Globally, the 1918 flu killed more people, an estimated 20 million to 50 million, according to the World Health Organization. Covid has taken the lives of approximately 4.7 million people worldwide so far, according to Johns Hopkins data.Members of the Red Cross Motor Corps, all wearing masks against the further spread of the influenza epidemic, carry a patient on a stretcher into their ambulance, Saint Louis, Missouri, October 1918.PhotoQuest | Getty ImagesUnlike today, there was no vaccine for the 1918 flu. There was also no CDC or national public health department. The Food and Drug Administration existed but consisted of a very small group of people. Additionally, there were no antibiotics, intensive care units, ventilators or IV fluids.Scientists hadn't even seen a virus under a microscope. They didn't have the technology and they knew almost nothing of virology, which was considered a nascent science because viruses are physically smaller under a microscope and more difficult to identify than bacterial infections."Obviously, we have much better advantages now, 100 years later," Dr. Paul Offit, who advises the FDA on Covid vaccines, said, adding he is "frustrated."The U.S. is worse off now than it was a year ago as a large portion of the nation's population remains unvaccinated, he added."I can tell you that we see a lot of children hospitalized as well, who have high-risk conditions and the problem is not that they didn't get their third dose. The problem is that they are unvaccinated," said Offit, also director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.Markel agreed that the U.S. has made advancements, saying, "the reality is we have no historical precedent for the moment we're in now."Subscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSupply Chain ValuesCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelDigital ProductsNews ReleasesClosed CaptioningCorrectionsAbout CNBCInternshipsSite MapAd ChoicesCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

Library of Congress/AP COVID-19 has now killed about as many Americans as the 1918-19 Spanish flu pandemic did — approximately 675,000. The U.S. population a century ago was just one-third of what it is today, meaning the flu cut a much bigger, more lethal swath through the country. But the COVID-19 crisis is by any measure a colossal tragedy in its own right, especially given the incredible advances in scientific knowledge since then and the failure to take maximum advantage of the vaccines available this time. "Big pockets of American society — and, worse, their leaders — have thrown this away," medical historian Dr. Howard Markel of the University of Michigan said of the opportunity to vaccinate everyone eligible by now.

Phillip/AP In this Thursday, March 19, 2020 file photo, a patient is taken on a stretcher into the United Memorial Medical Center after going through testing for COVID-19 in Houston. David J. Phillip/AP The ebbing of COVID-19 could happen if the virus progressively weakens as it mutates and more and more humans' immune systems learn to attack it. Vaccination and surviving infection are the main ways the immune system improves. Breast-fed infants also gain some immunity from their mothers. Under that optimistic scenario, schoolchildren would get mild illness that trains their immune systems. As they grow up, the children would carry the immune response memory, so that when they are old and vulnerable, the coronavirus would be no more dangerous than cold viruses. The same goes for today's vaccinated teens: Their immune systems would get stronger through the shots and mild infections. "We will all get infected," Antia predicted. "What's important is whether the infections are severe." Something similar happened with the H1N1 flu virus, the culprit in the 1918-19 pandemic. It encountered too many people who were immune, and it also eventually weakened through mutation. H1N1 still circulates today, but immunity acquired through infection and vaccination has triumphed. Coronavirus Updates COVID Vaccine For Kids Ages 5 To 11 Is Safe And Effective, Pfizer Says Getting an annual flu shot now protects against H1N1 and several other strains of flu. To be sure, flu kills between 12,000 and 61,000 Americans each year, but on average, it is a seasonal problem and a manageable one. Before COVID-19, the 1918-19 flu was universally considered the worst pandemic disease in human history. Whether the current scourge ultimately proves deadlier is unclear. In many ways, the 1918-19 flu — which was wrongly named Spanish flu because it first received widespread news coverage in Spain — was worse. Spread by the mobility of World War I, it killed young, healthy adults in vast numbers. No vaccine existed to slow it, and there were no antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections. And, of course, the world was much smaller. Sponsor Message Yet jet travel and mass migrations threaten to increase the toll of the current pandemic. Much of the world is unvaccinated.

David Goldman/AP Markel said he is continually astounded by the magnitude of the disruption the pandemic has brought to the planet. "I was gobsmacked by the size of the quarantines" the Chinese government undertook initially, Markel said, "and I've since been gob-gob-gob-smacked to the nth degree." The lagging pace of U.S. vaccinations is the latest source of his astonishment. Just under 64% of the U.S. population has received as least one dose of the vaccine, with state rates ranging from a high of approximately 77% in Vermont and Massachusetts to lows around 46% to 49% in Idaho, Wyoming, West Virginia and Mississippi. Globally, about 43% of the population has received at least one dose, according to Our World in Data, with some African countries just beginning to give their first shots. Coronavirus Updates Moderna Leads The Authorized COVID Vaccines In Lasting Effectiveness "We know that all pandemics come to an end," said Dr. Jeremy Brown, director of emergency care research at the National Institutes of Health, who wrote a book on influenza. "They can do terrible things while they're raging." COVID-19 could have been far less lethal in the U.S. if more people had gotten vaccinated faster, "and we still have an opportunity to turn it around," Brown said. "We often lose sight of how lucky we are to take these things for granted." The current vaccines work extremely well in preventing severe disease and death from the variants of the virus that have emerged so far. It will be crucial for scientists to make sure the ever-mutating virus hasn't changed enough to evade vaccines or to cause severe illness in unvaccinated children, Antia said. If the virus changes significantly, a new vaccine using the technology behind the Pfizer and Moderna shots could be produced in 110 days, a Pfizer executive said Wednesday. The company is studying whether annual shots with the current vaccine will be required to keep immunity high. Goats and Soda Readers Respond: What To Say If Someone Asks Why You're Wearing A Mask One plus: The coronavirus mutates at a slower pace than flu viruses, making it a more stable target for vaccination, said Ann Marie Kimball, a retired University of Washington professor of epidemiology. So, will the current pandemic unseat the 1918-19 flu pandemic as the worst in human history? "You'd like to say no. We have a lot more infection control, a lot more ability to support people who are sick. We have modern medicine," Kimball said. "But we have a lot more people and a lot more mobility. ... The fear is eventually a new strain gets around a particular vaccine target." Sponsor Message To those unvaccinated individuals who are counting on infection rather than vaccination for immune protection, Kimball said, "The trouble is, you have to survive infection to acquire the immunity." It's easier, she said, to go to the drugstore and get a shot.

They’re concerned about low immunization rates, particularly among some racial and ethnic minorities, because unvaccinated adults are more likely to develop severe illness and need hospitalization. Health experts also worry about a “twindemic” resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and flu season. Healthy People 2030, the federal government’s prevention agenda to build a healthier nation, has set a goal of inoculating 70% of the U.S. population against the flu each year. Yet, the most recent data, from the 2017-18 flu season, show that 46.1% of U.S. adults aged 19 years and older had received the flu vaccine during the influenza season. Coverage rates were lower among Black (39%) and Hispanic (37.5%) adults. The scope of shortfalls in adult vaccines goes beyond flu shots. Each year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updates its vaccine recommendations in the U.S. Adult Immunization Schedule, taking into account several factors including age, prior vaccinations and underlying health conditions. In addition to influenza, the vaccines include pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster (shingles), and Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis). But studies that have analyzed immunization trends for the recommended vaccines consistently show that many adults don’t get their recommended shots. Immunization rates among Black and Hispanic adults in the U.S. have been persistently lower for all recommended vaccines compared with white and Asian populations. Meanwhile, Black adults have the highest flu-related hospitalization rate in the U.S. — nearly twice as high as white individuals, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Three out of four adults are not caught up with their vaccinations and that is going to result in morbidity, mortality and [health care] costs,” says Litjen “L.J” Tan, chief policy and partnership officer at the nonprofit Immunization Action Coalition, who helped draft and publish “A Call to Action to Protect All Adults from Vaccine-Preventable Disease and Disability,” in August, urging health care providers to take action to improve routine vaccination of adults. The National Adult and Influenza Immunization Summit’s call to action was highlighted and endorsed by the CDC. The call to action was partly driven by the pandemic, but also by the chronically low adult vaccination rates overall, says Tan, who is also co-chair of the National Adult and Influenza Immunization Summit. “If we had done our [adult] vaccinations well before COVID, we wouldn’t have had the struggle that we have now,” he says. Source: CDC Educating adults about vaccines and why they’re safe and effective could have helped reduce the vaccine hesitancy that we face today, he adds. There are several reasons for low adult vaccination rates and persisting disparities. For one, routine physician check-ups wane as children enter adulthood and “provider recommendation is extremely important for an adult to get vaccinated,” says Tan. Another barrier is access to vaccines, he adds. Other factors include lower level of education and income, racism, lack of access to health care and transportation, and a lack of trust in the health care system due to experiencing racism in the past. Tan hopes the systems that are being put into place now to vaccinate adults against COVID-19 will help improve coverage for other adult vaccines. “Don’t let it just go away because the crisis goes away,” Tan says. Below, we’ve gathered several studies that further parse out disparities in adult immunizations. Research roundup Racial/Ethnic and Socioeconomic Disparities in Adult Vaccination Coverage Kosuke Kawai and Alison Tse Kawai. American Journal of Preventive Medicine, October 2021. Vaccine hesitancy: A roundup of research summaries and survey data sources The study analyzes trends in influenza, pneumococcal disease, herpes zoster (shingles), and Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis) vaccination coverage using the National Health Interview Surveys from 2010 to 2019, including a total of 311,343 adults. It shows even though overall adult vaccination rates increased between 2010 and 2019, many gaps remain. Conducted annually in person among a nationally representative sample of adults, the National Health Interview Survey collects data on demographics, health status, insurance coverage and access to health care. It is one of the major data collection programs of the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. The survey collects self-reported flu and Tdap vaccination information from adults aged between 18 and 64 years. For those aged 65 and older, it collects self-reported flu, Tdap, pneumococcal and shingles vaccination information. The study reveals several trends. Overall, white adults are more likely to receive their recommended shots than Black and Hispanic adults. Also, older adults (65 years and up) have higher vaccine coverage than those under 65. Low household incomes and low education levels were associated with lower vaccine uptake. Also, adults without health insurance had a substantially lower uptake of vaccination compared with those who had health insurance, the study shows. “Promoting health equity in immunization rates for the new vaccines against COVID-19 during the pandemic is critical because individuals from racial and ethnic minority groups are disproportionately affected by COVID-19,” the authors write. “Efforts are urgently needed to achieve equity in immunization rates.” Socioeconomic disparities in vaccination coverage rates have persisted among adults aged 65 years and older, the study shows. The authors say some of the barriers for this age group include concerns about out-of-pocket costs and low stock in doctors’ offices due to the cost of storing the vaccines. To improve adult vaccination rates, researchers offer several solutions. Reminders from providers and standing orders from health care providers have been found effective in reducing disparities, they write. Large-scale programs that distribute and administer vaccines to uninsured and underinsured adults could also be effective. Another effective model is the Vaccines for Children program, which is a federally-funded entitlement program that provides free vaccines to uninsured and underinsured children. The program has been credited with narrowing racial and ethnic disparities in children’s immunization rates in recent decades. Surveillance of Vaccination Coverage Among Adult Populations — United States, 2018 Dr. Peng-Jun Lu; et al. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, May 2021. 6 tips for covering COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy The study analyzes data from the 2017 and 2018 National Health Interview Survey, in which a total of 25,307 adults aged 19 years and older participated. It shows persisting racial and ethnic disparities in vaccination rates for several adult vaccines, including flu, pneumococcal disease, shingles and tetanus shots. The study also shows that having health insurance coverage, having a usual place to receive health care and having one or more interactions with a doctor during the prior year are associated with higher vaccination rates. “Awareness of the need for vaccines for adults is low among the general population, and adult patients rely on provider recommendations for vaccination,” the authors write. “Because of COVID-19-related reductions in persons accessing vaccination services, it is important to assess the vaccination status of all patients at each visit to avoid missed opportunities for vaccination and ensure timely vaccine catch-up.” The study also looks at vaccination coverage among health care providers, showing that immunization rates among those with direct patient contact is higher than those without direct patient care. For instance, in 2018, 72.6% of health care providers with direct patient care got their flu shot compared with 70.5% of those without direct patient care. Among those with direct patient care, flu vaccine coverage among white providers (72.3%) was similar to coverage for Black providers (75.0%) and Hispanic providers (70.3%), the analysis shows. Those numbers, however, fell below the Healthy People 2020 target of 90% coverage, according to the study. Meanwhile, white providers with direct patient care had higher rates of hepatitis B vaccine coverage (82.3%) compared with Black providers (58.1%) and Hispanic providers (62.6%).

Consistent with other studies, the analysis shows that even though overall vaccination rates increased between 2016 and 2017, white adults in the U.S. had higher rates of vaccination compared with people of color. “Large disparities in vaccination coverage by race/ethnicity have remained mostly unchanged over the last several years, with white adults having the highest coverage for most vaccines and age groups,” the authors write. “Achieving significant improvements in overall coverage while reducing racial/ethnic disparities will require action at multiple levels of the healthcare system.” Influenza Vaccination Coverage Among Adults by Nativity, Race/Ethnicity, Citizenship, and Language of the Interview United States, 2012–13 Through 2017–18 Influenza Seasons Meagan Chuey; et al. American Journal of Infection Control, September 2021. The study analyzes the differences in influenza vaccination rates during the 2012-2013 through 2017-2018 flu seasons using the National Health Interview Survey. It finds that while flu immunization rates improved among U.S.-born adults, they didn’t change significantly among foreign-born individuals, particularly among non-U.S. citizen adults. The annual sample size ranged from 24,000 and 33,000, of which 17.7% to 18.9% were foreign born. More than half of foreign-born respondents were naturalized U.S. citizens. Also, most white and Black adults were born in the United States, while most Hispanic and Asian respondents were foreign born. Foreign-born adults had significantly lower vaccination rates than U.S.-born adults for most flu seasons in the study. Their vaccination rate in the 2017-18 flu season was 4.5 percentage points lower (42.4% vs. 46.9%, respectively), the study shows. The findings are important because foreign-born individuals represent 17% of the U.S. workforce and are more likely to be essential workers with jobs in the health care and food production industries, researchers write. “Achieving high influenza vaccination coverage among the foreign-born population will help reduce illness among the essential workforce, achieve national vaccination goals, and reduce racial and ethnic disparities in vaccination coverage in the US,” they write. The authors list several potential reasons for the disparity. “Foreign-born populations experience inequities in socioeconomic conditions and access to health care and preventive services that are negatively associated with vaccination coverage,” they write. “Foreign-born adults may also be less aware of US adult immunization recommendations or have different attitudes toward vaccinations.” Trends in Place of Early-Season Influenza Vaccination Among Adults, 2014-15 Through 2018-19 Influenza Seasons — The Importance of Medical and Nonmedical Settings for Vaccination Peng-jun Lu; et al. American Journal of Infection Control, May 2021. Analysis of data from the 2014 to 2018 National Health Interview Survey shows that increasing access to flu vaccines — whether it’s at the doctor’s office, workplace, supermarket or pharmacy — is important in improving immunization rates. The doctor’s office was the most common place for receiving the flu vaccine, followed by the pharmacy and workplace, the study shows. But the study also shows racial and ethnic differences in where people get vaccinated. Black and Hispanic adults were significantly more likely to receive their flu vaccine in medical settings and less likely to receive it in nonmedical settings like the pharmacy and workplace compared with white adults. “These associations may result from place of vaccination preferences, differences in vaccine-seeking behavior, differences in availability of nonmedical settings offering vaccinations, or disparate availability of workplace vaccination among socioeconomic groups,” the authors write. Influenza-Related Hospitalizations and Poverty Levels — United States, 2010–2012 Dr. James Hadler; et al. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, February 2016. The study shows that flu hospitalization rates in neighborhoods where 20% or more of the residents lived below the federal poverty level were twice as high as in areas where less than 5% of people lived below the federal poverty level. In other words, people who lived in high poverty neighborhoods had a higher risk of severe flu outcomes. Researchers say some of the contributing factors include lower vaccination rates among people who live in poorer neighborhoods, poverty-related crowding that can lead to more flu transmission and higher rates of underlying medical conditions that increase the risk of severe flu. The study authors recommend increasing vaccination rates in poor neighborhoods and improving access to antiviral medications at clinics and doctors’ offices. Primary Care Physicians’ Perspective on Financial Issues and Adult Immunization in the Era of the Affordable Care Act Dr. Laura Hurley; et al. Vaccine, January 2017. In an internet and mail survey of 317 general internists and 236 family physicians, 24% to 30% of the respondents said, “adult patients defer or refuse certain vaccines for financial reasons most of the time.” Also, 35% said they didn’t recommend vaccines because they thought the patient’s insurance wouldn’t cover it. Meanwhile, 37% were “not at all aware” of the vaccine coverage provisions of the Affordable Care Act. “Physician recommendation is critical to patient receipt of vaccines, yet we found that physicians are not recommending vaccines to adults for financial reasons,” the authors write. “Regardless of actual insurance coverage, if physicians perceive that vaccines are not covered, they may not recommend them.” Early-Season Influenza Vaccination Uptake and Intent Among Adults — United States, September 2020 Megan Lindley; et al. U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, December 2020. In an online survey, a nationally representative sample of 3,594 U.S. adults were asked about their intent to get the flu shot for the 2020-21 influenza season. Results reveal the COVID-19 pandemic didn’t have a substantial effect on the general public’s attitude toward the flu vaccine. The proportion of people who said they intended to get the flu shot was slightly higher — 59% versus 52.2% in the 2019-2020 flu season — but demographic differences remained largely similar to previous flu seasons, according to the study. “Particularly concerning are the disparities in vaccination intent by race/ethnicity: approximately half of Black and Hispanic respondents reported intent to receive influenza vaccination compared with 61% of White respondents and 65% of other-race respondents,” the authors write.

This disease is caused by influenza viruses, different from those that cause avian influenza in birds. ANSES, the agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety in France, as the national reference laboratory for swine influenza, is in charge of monitoring and characterizing these viruses in farms. As such, ANSES is in close contact with the CNR to share the tools for studying porcine influenza viruses and with Public Health France to investigate the possible relationship between this virus (H1N2) v detected in a patient and related viruses circulating in animals. For many years, ANSES has been carrying out research on the viruses responsible for this infection in pigs and their evolution. According to ARS Brittany, the patient was hospitalized, his clinical condition is now favorable. The local authorities are mobilized and call for vigilance of health professionals in Brittany. Investigations are underway by the health authorities to determine the circumstances of the infection and establish a list of people who have been in contact with the patient. At this stage, a link between the infection and the exposure of the individual to live pigs in the week prior to symptom onset cannot be confirmed. No other symptomatic person was detected in the close entourage of the patient. Due to the active circulation in pig farms of a viral strain close to the virus involved in this infection, health professionals in the region have been asked to carry out a systematic search for influenza viruses in any person in contact with pigs, and those showing symptoms of acute respiratory infection (fever, sore throat, headache, cough). ANSES was mandated to conduct epidemiological investigations in the breeding of pigs believed to be the source of the contamination. Cases of influenza virus transmission to humans have already been sporadically detected internationally. Since January 2021, around 10 cases of human infection with A (H3N2) v, A (H1N1) v and A (H1N2) v viruses of porcine origin have been confirmed in the United States, Canada, Taiwan, Denmark and Germany. Human cases of infection with porcine influenza viruses are generally mild, although a few severe cases have been reported, and no sustained human-to-human transmission chain has been reported to date. Being the cause of respiratory infections, the influenza virus of porcine origin is not transmissible to humans through the consumption of meat of pig origin, more generally through food.

Science Pandemics How Many Americans Died From Spanish Flu and How Did the Pandemic End? Published Sep 21, 2021 at 7:19 AM EDT By Robert Lea FOLLOW Share Copy Link ✓ Link copied to clipboard! Deaths related to COVID-19 in the U.S. have reached 676,000, surpassing the number that died during the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918.Until now, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had considered the influenza epidemic of 1918 to be the worst pandemic in modern history. The virus behind the pandemic was an H1N1 strain of flu originating in birds.Some 500 million people, around a quarter of the world's population at the time, contracted the virus. It was named after the country where it first came to prominence. Spain was hard hit by the virus and, as a result of it having no media blackout during wartime, the disease became associated with the country. Globally, the influenza killed some 10 percent of those who contracted it.In the U.S. alone the 1918 influenza epidemic killed an estimated 675,000, around one in five people who contracted the virus.

However, as researchers wouldn't discover the viral nature of influenza until the 1930s, it was still considered bacterial.With no real medical intervention against the Spanish Flu, the first recorded case of which was at Fort Riley, Kansas, in March 1918, the only protection against the virus was all too familiar measures such as isolation, the limiting of gatherings, improved personal hygiene and quarantines.Each wave of the Spanish Flu seemed to be deadlier. By the third wave, contemporary reports stated the virus could kill a healthy person within a day.This resulted in a situation in which anyone having contracted Spanish Flu either died or became immune, slowing the spread of the virus. By the summer of 1919, the third wave was over and the pandemic ended.The global spread of the 1918 flu is often referred to as "the forgotten pandemic" because it was overshadowed by the First World War and media blackouts in many countries at the time. This is despite the fact it claimed over twice as many lives, with an estimated 20 million killed in the conflict.Yet, Spanish Flu, or 1918 H1N1 as it is officially known, isn't "dead." However, because of the supply of antivirals and the flu vaccine, the Spanish Flu is unlikely to be the cause of another pandemic.Just as it was once overshadowed by WWI, the 1918 pandemic has now been eclipsed by COVID-19. According to The New York Times COVID map, the number of deaths in the U.S. during this current pandemic has topped the number reached by the Spanish Flu.

That number surpasses the number of lives lost to the 1918 flu. The U.S. is averaging more than 2,000 daily deaths. William Brangham takes a wider look at COVID's toll on the country. Read the Full Transcript Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. Judy Woodruff : The death toll from the COVID pandemic has put the U.S. at another tragic milestone. We are averaging more than 2,000 deaths a day lately.And, yesterday, the U.S. marked more than 675,000 Americans overall who have now died of COVID.William Brangham takes a wider look at this difficult period of our country's history. William Brangham: Throughout this pandemic, it's been hard to keep perspective on the true scale of the losses caused by COVID-19.On the Washington Mall right now, artist Suzanne Brennan Firstenberg has planted an ocean of white flags, one for each life lost to the virus.Another metric is a comparison to the past, and, this week, the U.S. matched the death toll from another terrible virus, the 1918 influenza pandemic.For some perspective on then and now, I'm joined by Dr. Jeremy Brown. He wrote the book "Influenza: The Hundred Year Hunt to Cure the Deadliest Disease in History." And he is currently director of Office of Emergency Care Research at the National Institutes of Health.Dr. Brown, very good to see you again.We have now hit his awful bar in the U.S., where we have lost as many people to COVID as we lost to the influenza pandemic. But there are meaningful differences between the two, right?Dr. Jeremy Brown, National Institutes of Health: Yes, indeed.It is indeed awful to be speaking at this terrible milestone, 675,000 deaths, the same number as the people who died in the U.S. in the 1918 pandemic.But we must also recall that this pandemic is still far less deadly than that terrible one in 1918. The population in the U.S. in 1918 was around 100 million. Today, it's around 320 million. So, if we put these numbers into proportion, then those 675,000 deaths 103 years ago, relatively speaking, would be the equivalent of some two million deaths today.We are nowhere near that number, thankfully. But, still, today's numbers are still a reminder of just how deadly COVID is. William Brangham: And, of course, another main difference, perhaps maybe the largest difference, is, we now have a vaccine to fight this virus, whereas, back then, we did not. Dr. Jeremy Brown: That's right.Back then, not only was there no vaccine for influenza, but people didn't even know what it was that was killing them. This, I think, in many — in many ways, was perhaps the most frightening aspect of the disease. Fast forward 100 years later. We knew what COVID was. We knew its genetic makeup within about three or four weeks of the first cases.And then we developed this incredible series of vaccines in really record-breaking time. William Brangham: Are there similarities, though, between then and now that have hit notes with you throughout this pandemic? Dr. Jeremy Brown: Yes, there are a number of similarities.And I think, first of all, if we think about the ways that we can combat the disease, the simple, basic ways, those haven't really changed over 100 years, the call to mask up, to cover your face, to isolate when you're feeling unwell. Together, we have seen some really — breakthroughs that were unthinkable a century ago.So, we have these very high-tech innovations. And we also have some very low-tech, but no less effective ways for the majority of us to stay healthy. William Brangham: And some of those protective measures that you mentioned, masking, distancing, and mandates and things like that, have caused incredible political strife in this country.I mean, even the vaccines, which are seen by many as the golden ticket, are a menace in the eyes of some. Does that aspect of our pandemic response surprise you? Dr. Jeremy Brown: I think the virulence with which it occurred did surprise me.But anybody who's looked at pandemics over the last couple of hundred years will realize that all of these responses are actually not new. There has been an opposition to government-mandated vaccines ever since the smallpox vaccine was around in the late 1780s, and there were some quite virulent anti-vaccine movements both in England and here in the United States.But there is nothing really new about these behaviors, although, as I said, I think the number of people who have joined them, I think, is surprising, though, certainly, we didn't see numbers like this, for example, with the movement against smallpox vaccines a couple of hundred years ago. William Brangham: Another striking aspect, as I have been watching this, is who has actually died from this virus.I know many people have been talking about this statistic of one in 500 Americans have died. But within that, racial minorities, Blacks and Latinos in America have suffered far worse. I mean, this has been a true tragedy in those communities as well. Dr. Jeremy Brown: Yes, I think one of the mantras that we heard at the beginning of the pandemic is that we're all in this together. But the truth of the matter is, the pandemic has struck us all in very different ways, depending on where we live, what we do for a living, what our family situation is, and also just which families we are born into.We know that COVID has dropped the average life expectancy here in the U.S. by about a year-and-a-half. This is indeed awful. But for the African American community, life expectancy has actually dropped by almost three years, so, much higher than for the rest of the population.And this really shows us, again, that there are some tremendous disparities that we have, both in our — the availability of medicines and treatment therapies, and also in the way that we need to reach out to different communities and invite them to be part of the vaccine relief program. William Brangham: When you look at 1918 America, compared to 2020 and 2021 America, is there something about the national psyches then and now that helps us understand how we have responded? Dr. Jeremy Brown: I think this is a key point.A hundred years ago, we were at the end of the First World War. America was weary. There was still a war going on, and that coupled with the reality that pandemics were an everyday part of existence. People died from diphtheria and measles. People died from pneumonia. And I think we have forgotten just how lucky we are not to have these diseases.It's only really these tremendous advances that we have had both in the area of public health and on vaccines that have meant that we have the luxury of not waking up every morning and being afraid of polio, or being afraid of diphtheria. William Brangham: I think it's fair to say that there's a real sense of despair in the country right now. I mean, for many people, they thought the vaccines were the light at the end of the tunnel, at least domestically, for this virus.But now deaths are up, hospitals are overflowing, Delta is everywhere in the country. Do you think that there is something that we missed at the beginning of this year, when we all thought, we're coming to the end of this, and it's turned out not to be the case? Dr. Jeremy Brown: Well, I think what we have missed is nature's ability to surprise us.While we are indeed in the middle of a very bad run right now, there is no doubt that we have to bear in mind that all pandemics come to an end. This is true before antibiotics. This is true before there were vaccines. And this will be true of COVID as well.The question is, what can we as a society do to minimize the destruction and the deaths that is caused by COVID? So, whichever class or group of people you most identify with, I think there are very, very strong reasons for us now to turn to those last many millions of Americans out there and get vaccinated as quickly as possible.That is the one surefire way to make sure that we don't have another discussion in a few more months, you and I, about that death toll has risen to a new — to a new terrible marker. William Brangham: All right, Dr. Jeremy Brown of the Office of Emergency Care Research at the National Institutes of Health, good to see you. Thank you very much. Dr. Jeremy Brown: Thank you.

Experts don’t knowThe flu season is underway(WBRC)By Makayla Clark and Jay LuzardoPublished: Sep. 20, 2021 at 7:00 PM AKDT|Updated: Sep. 22, 2021 at 9:31 AM AKDTEmail This LinkShare on FacebookShare on X (formerly Twitter)Share on PinterestShare on LinkedInANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) - During the pandemic, it seems like the flu was put on the back burner as COVID-19 took center stage. However, the flu was still circulating.Alaska Immunization Program Manager Matthew Bobo said last year’s flu season in Alaska saw less cases than normal.According to a State of Alaska Epidemiology influenza surveillance bulletin, only 124 positive tests were reported in the 2020–21 flu season, which compares to approximately 4,000–7,000 cases during each of the past five flu seasons.The bulletin also states that Alaska reported two flu-related deaths during the 2020-21 flu season. The state reported 11 flu-related deaths in the 2019-20 flu season.“Each flu season is different and it’s hard to predict even one flu season,” Bobo said.He said the decrease in flu cases could have been for many reasons. He said a contributing factor could be the pandemic precautions people were taking.In the bulletin, officials said low flu cases in the state are likely caused by the virus’ transmissibility being subdued by COVID-19 mitigation measures, such as social distancing, wearing masks and quarantining. However, the bulletin also stated it’s “likely that testing specifically for influenza was occurring at lower levels than during a typical season.”“As people were staying inside more and not going out-and-about, there was less influenza circling,” Bobo said.According to Bobo, it is important to prevent getting sick since influenza can lead to hospitalization.He said the flu season starts in late August and goes through March or April, but Alaska sees the flu all year long, adding that it is mainly because of tourists visiting in the summer.The flu vaccine is available now. Bobo said last year’s flu vaccination rate was a little bit higher than a typical year, with about 40% of Alaskans vaccinated.Bobo recommends getting the shot before October is over. He said young children and pregnant women in their third trimester should get the shot as soon as possible; however, older people should wait to get it closer to the end of October.“If they get the vaccine earlier than that, the immunity can wain,” he said.Editor’s note: This story has been updated to include more information from the State of Alaska Epidemiology bulletin.Copyright 2021 KTUU.

Advertisement Now that the US death toll from COVID-19 has surpassed 676,000, the coronavirus pandemic has killed more Americans than the 1918-19 influenza pandemic did.Axios and the Associated Press both reported the grim milestone on Monday.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate the pandemic over 100 years ago killed 675,000 people, many of whom were younger than 65 years old.Back then, there wasn't a flu shot to protect people from getting infected. Today, the FDA has authorized three COVID-19 vaccines, and 64% of Americans have received at least one dose. Advertisement In 1918, the US population was about 103 million. Today, it's more than 330 million.So although the total number of Americans who died in each crisis is about the same, because of the population difference, influenza infected about one-quarter of Americans from 1918-19, and killed 0.65%.More Americans died from the flu those years than died in World War I.Today, COVID-19 has infected more than 12% of Americans and killed about 0.2%. Advertisement Both pandemics saw the impact of globalization help the spread of the virus, though in different capacities.During the influenza pandemic, World War I contributed to the spread of the virus, killing healthy young people in mass quantities without the aid of modern medicine.

Centre for Disease Control said the flu shot is expected to be widely available mid-October. (Ben Nelms/CBC)Social SharingDr. Brian Conway has advice for anyone thinking about getting a flu shot this fall. "Run! Don't walk to get your flu shot," he said, speaking from his office at the Vancouver Infectious Disease Centre. "I think there is great consensus behind the statements that there will be a significant influenza season going forward." The bad flu season experts see looming on the horizon is due, in part, to last fall and winter when influenza was effectively eliminated in British Columbia and across Canada, thanks to COVID-19 health orders that prevented gatherings and travel, and promoted physical distancing, mask-wearing and hand-washing. But, with social life now returning to normal, zero flu last season will have consequences this season, in that the population is likely now more susceptible to the virus.The DoseViruses limited by COVID-19 restrictions are coming back strong this fall, experts say"People don't have any built-up immunity that they might have [developed] from a flu season last year, or from getting their [flu] shots last year, or both," said Conway."So we'll go from the best year on record for influenza to something other than that."The B.C. Centre for Disease Control said the flu shot is expected to be widely available mid-October.Symptoms of influenza — fever, cough, sore throat, head and muscle aches — can be similar to those of the much more lethal COVID-19. Dr. Ross Chang, past president of the B.C. Society of Allergy and Immunology, said people should seek a COVID-19 test if they are at all concerned."I think that any kind of infection with fever that persists certainly deserves a COVID test," he said. "COVID infections have a whole range, so patients can be infected with COVID and be asymptomatic."Why is there no flu amid so many COVID cases? Your COVID-19 questions answeredFor those people yet to be vaccinated against COVID-19, Chang suggests leaving one to two weeks between a COVID shot and the flu jab in order to manage any side-effects."It's important not to get them at the same time — not because they interact, but because the adverse effects can be very similar," he said. With COVID-19 still circulating widely, Conway said it's even more critical that people be immunized against both COVID and the flu."It will reduce the amount of disease that spreads in the community — both influenza and COVID — and reduce the number of people that have to interact with the health-care system," he said.Two companies, Moderna Inc. and Novavax Inc., have announced they are working on a combined flu and COVID-19 vaccine, which Conway believes will be the future."There's the expectation in many circles that COVID is going to be around for a while. Flu, obviously, has been around for a while and will be around and we're just going to be vaccinating people for both on a yearly basis," he said. "But for now, please run and get your flu shot."with files from The Early EditionCBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorRelated Stories Top stories from British Columbia Special ballot counts continue as 2 federal ridings in B.C. remain undecided Here's how the housing landscape could change under a newly re-elected Liberal government Vancouver renter questions landlord's 'duplicitous' new payment schemeFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookXYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

Each year, flu viruses are constantly changing. For the 2020-2021 flu season, the influenza vaccine was updated to better fight the virus. Out of caution, the flu vaccine will be administered at least 14 days before or after someone receives a COVID-19 vaccine. During the peak of the pandemic last year, the flu season was virtually nonexistent. This could be attributed to the COVID-19 protocols set into place, such as masking and social distancing. This year, lockdown rules are more passive, so is a higher risk of flu transmission. To further prevent the spread of influenza and COVID-19 virus, people are recommended to wear face masks and practice good hand hygiene. Before getting a flu vaccine, patients should consult their doctor to ensure their health status permits vaccination.

(Matt Gade | The Grand Rapids Press)The Grand Rapids PressBy Annalise Knudson | aknudson@siadvance.comSTATEN ISLAND, N.Y. — As the United States prepares for the flu season, the best way to prevent yourself and your family from getting the flu is by getting the shot each year, according to recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs, the CDC states. It can cause mild to severe illness, and at times, can lead to death.Flu season can start in the United States as early as October and end as late as early May. Normally, it peaks from December through February.The best way to prevent the flu is getting the flu vaccine, which is recommended for everyone 6 months and older, with few exceptions.September and October are generally the best times to be vaccinated. The CDC said that everyone should be vaccinated by the end of October. Getting vaccinated later can still be beneficial, and vaccination should continue to be offered throughout the flu season, into January or later.Flu shots have been shown to reduce flu-related illnesses and the risk of serious flu complications that can result in hospitalization or death. They cause antibodies to develop in the body about two weeks after vaccination. These antibodies provide protection against infection with circulating influenza viruses.The shots are designed to protect against the influenza viruses that research indicates will be most common during the upcoming season. All flu vaccines in the United States are “quadrivalent” vaccines, which means they protect against four different flu viruses: an influenza A(H1N1) virus, an influenza A(H3N2) virus, and two influenza B viruses, according to the CDC.Different flu vaccines are approved for use in different groups of people, the CDC stated.There are flu shots approved for use in children as young as 6 months old and flu shots approved for use in adults 65 years and older.Flu shots also are recommended for pregnant people and people with certain chronic health conditions.The nasal spray flu vaccine is approved for use in non-pregnant people who are 2 years through 49 years of age. People who are pregnant and people with certain medical conditions should not receive the nasal spray flu vaccine.There are also many vaccine options you can choose from, and the CDC doesn’t recommend any one flu vaccine over another.While most people should be vaccinated for the flu each year, some shouldn’t be vaccinated, or shouldn’t receive some types of shots, depending on things like age, health (current and past) and whether they have certain allergies.People who have a history of severe egg allergy should be vaccinated in a medical setting, supervised by a health-care provider who is able to recognize and manage severe allergic reactions.

Pierce | Sep. 24, 2021, 6:59 p.m. | Updated: 10:13 p.m.Utah is facing a viral winter “the likes of which we haven’t seen before” because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the onset of cold and flu season, according to an infectious diseases physician for Intermountain Healthcare.“The last thing we can afford is to have significant numbers of patients who are ill with influenza and a high volume of COVID and RSV and others,” Brandon Webb, the physician, said. “These are all preventable.”Webb encouraged Utahns to get vaccinated, both for COVID-19 and for the flu. He noted that the state last winter saw historically low rates of influenza and other severe respiratory issues unrelated to COVID-19. At the time, residents were wearing masks, social distancing and taking other precautions.“I think it’s clear that, as a whole, we’re not practicing the same level of hygiene and prevention measures that we did last season,” Webb said, later adding that, “Unless something changes, we don’t expect to enjoy the same benefit this season.”He encouraged people to continue wearing masks and taking proper precautions — including in Utah’s schools, where masking allowed for more days of in-person learning last year than most states saw, Webb said.“We need to be very careful not to abandon tools in our toolbox that have been very effective in the past,” Webb said.This year, COVID-19 infection rates and hospitalizations among school-age children are significantly higher than they were this time last year. Webb said those reported cases may only be the tip of the iceberg, because there’s a “significant degree” of under-testing in that population, which makes the data “very difficult to assess.”According to state data, 35% of Utah’s cases are among people under the age of 25. Younger people tend to be more asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, but still remain “very capable of spreading it to higher risk individuals,” Webb said. “Especially the individuals who are unvaccinated and in that middle age group with some medical comorbidities.”Intermountain Healthcare ICUs are between 97-100% full, Webb said. Data shows that statewide, about 52% of all ICU patients are non-COVID patients, which the onset of flu season threatens to compound.“We, with confidence, strongly endorse vaccination as the single most effective method and most sustainable method for preventing both severe disease [and] the emergence of variants — for protecting those around us, and for transitioning into a normal that’s closer to the normal that we’d all like to get to,” Webb said.RELATED STORIESPREMIUMCould Utah have a cold season this summer?

Yesterday, September 20, 2021, the United States marked a grisly milestone, recording more American deaths from COVID-19 than from the 1918 –1919 Spanish flu. There have been several major pandemics in the last 100 years, but the 1918 influenza pandemic, dubbed the Spanish flu, was one of the worst. Caused by an H1N1 virus that originated in birds, it was first identified in the U.S. in military personnel in spring 1918. It was dubbed the Spanish flu because it was thought at the time to have originated in Spain. Research published in 2005 suggests it actually originated in New York. It was named Spanish flu because Spain was neutral in World War I (1914 –1918), meaning it could report on the severity of the pandemic, but countries fighting the war were suppressing reports on how the disease affected their populations. At its worse, the Spanish flu infected 500 million people worldwide, which at the time was about a third of the Earth’s population. More than 50 million people died of the disease worldwide, with 675,000 in the U.S. There is some disagreement on that figure, with recent researchers suggesting it was about 17.4 million deaths, while others go as high as 100 million. The fatality rate for the Spanish flu is calculated at about 2%. However, at the time of the Spanish flu, health care was significantly less advanced. There were no antibiotics, no antivirals, and no vaccines against the Spanish flu. One reason the Spanish flu was so lethal was there were no antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections, so control efforts around the globe were limited to non-pharmaceutical responses like isolation, quarantine, disinfectants and limiting public gatherings, although then as now, they were applied erratically. The first flu vaccine to be licensed in the U.S. came about in the 1940s. “Big pockets of American society — and, worse, their leaders — have thrown this away,” medical historian Howard Markel of the University of Michigan, told NPR, of the reluctance for people to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The Spanish flu’s H1N1 and the COVID-19 coronavirus are both considered “novel,” which is to say, they are so new that nobody in either era had immunity to them. One marked difference between the two is the most affected groups in the 1918 pandemic were otherwise healthy adults between the ages of 20 to 40. Mortality was also higher in people younger than five years of age and 65 and older. “The 1918 pandemic strain influenza was new and novel for most people under the age of 40 or 50, but that’s where the death rate really was high—that’s different than the usual flu,” Mark Schleiss, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Minnesota told Healthline in 2020, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Spanish flu did not completely disappear, and many scientists suspect COVID-19 won’t either. The hope is it will become a mild, seasonal infection as people’s immunity grows from vaccination and repeated infection— basically going from pandemic to endemic—but that process takes time. “We hope it will be like getting a cold, but there’s no guarantee,” said Rustom Antia, a biologist with Emory University. However, there are about 1,900 deaths per day on average in the U.S. from COVID-19, the highest since early March 2021. There are concerns that winter will bring another surge. The University of Washington’s model projects another 100,000 Americans will die of COVID-19 by January 1, 2022, which would bring the total deaths in the U.S. to about 776,000. Globally, COVID-19 deaths are around 4.6 million. The 1918 –19 influenza pandemic took 50 million lives, and the world’s population was a quarter of what it is now. In an endemic situation, at its most optimistic, mutations would weaken the virus and humans’ immune systems learn to fight it. Vaccination and previous infections are how the immune system typically improves, although breastfed infants pick up some immunity from their mothers. School-aged children would become only mild infected, and as they grow up, their immune memory would make the disease much less dangerous as they grow older. Emory’s Antia notes, “We will all get infected. What’s important is whether the infections are severe.” The H1N1 flu virus from the Spanish flu eventually dissipated because so many people were infected, and mutations are believed to have weakened it. H1N1 still circulates today but is generally not as deadly as it was a century ago. There are annual vaccinations and most people have had previous exposure to it. There are still deaths from the flu, about 12,000 to 61,000 in the U.S., but it is generally viewed as a seasonal and manageable problem. In the U.S., slightly under 64% of the population has received at least one dose of the vaccine against COVID-19, with states varying significantly. For example, 77% of Vermont and Massachusetts are vaccinated, while 46% to 49% of Idaho, Wyoming, West Virginia and Mississippi are vaccinated. Worldwide, about 43% of the population has received at least one dose, according to Our World in Data. “We know that all pandemics come to an end,” Jeremy Brown, director of emergency care research at the National Institutes of Health, told NPR. “They can do terrible things while they’re raging.” He added that in the U.S., if people had gotten vaccinated more quickly, the disease could have been much less lethal, “and we still have an opportunity to turn it around. We often lose sight of how lucky we are to take these things for granted.” Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Email Print Healthcare Infectious disease COVID-19 Mark Terry LATEST Alzheimer’s Leqembi, Kisunla and Beyond: The Next Wave of Alzheimer’s at CTAD 2024 November 11, 2024 · 6 min read · Kate Goodwin Huntington’s After Decades of Failure, First Disease-Modifying Huntington’s Treatment on the Horizon November 11, 2024 · 7 min read · Heather McKenzie Opinion Drugs Are Becoming “Smarter.” Here’s How November 11, 2024 · 6 min read · David Benshoof Klein Huntington’s 5 Huntington’s Therapies to Watch November 11, 2024 · 5 min read · Kate Goodwin Alzheimer’s disease Eisai Cuts Fiscal 2024 Guidance for Biogen-Partnered Leqembi as Sales Disappoint Analysts November 8, 2024 · 2 min read · Tristan Manalac FEATURED STORIES Editorial Lilly vs. Novo: The ‘He Said, She Said’ Row About Catalent’s GLP-1 Work November 8, 2024 · 4 min read · Greg Slabodkin Funding Navigating a Biotech Exit in a Rebounding Market November 6, 2024 · 8 min read · Ana Mulero Job trends Cell Therapy Biotechs Hunt for Autoimmune Expertise in Pivot From Oncology November 6, 2024 · 6 min read · Annalee Armstrong Business Lacks Family Lawsuits Seek Share of Profits Stemming from HeLa Cells November 5, 2024 · 7 min read · Sanjukta Mondal CAR T CAR T and Related Therapies Home In on Autoimmune Disease November 4, 2024 · 9 min read · Shawna Williams MORE ON THIS TOPIC China AstraZeneca’s China Head Taken Into Custody by Chinese Authorities: Reports November 8, 2024 · 2 min read · Tristan Manalac China Pfizer Makes $1B Commitment in China to Boost Innovation, Targets Chinese Market November 8, 2024 · 2 min read · Tristan Manalac Layoff Tracker Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Will Lay Off 45% of Employees November 7, 2024 · 176 min read · BioSpace Editorial Staff Layoffs Viracta Therapeutics Cuts 42% of Staff as Part of Resource Reprioritization November 7, 2024 · 2 min read · Angela Gabriel BioSpace is the digital hub for life science news and jobs.

(KESQ) - It is flu season and not only are humans being advised to get the flu shot, but also our furry friends to protect them from canine influenza.Kathryn Carlson, the owner of Village Park Animal Hospital, says dogs can get really sick with canine influenza.“It actually develops into pneumonia,” she said.The pneumonia can go undetected and eventually land a dog in the emergency room.Los Angeles Veterinary Public Health recently reported their largest outbrea of the dog flu at 10 cases. Because of this, veterinarians across Coachella Valley are seeing more people getting their dogs the flu vaccine.“The most important thing to know is that there is a vaccine that prevents it,” Carlson said.Over the last few weeks, Village Park Animal Hospital in La Quinta, Calif. say it has detected three cases already.The dog flu test usually costs about $200, but Carlson says it is important to detect when a dog has the flu.“It really is more serious as we start seeing these outbreaks because you can certainly think its something minor like kennel cough and it can be something a lot more complicated,” she said.If your dog is not immune from the flu yet, it is advised to keep your pet from certain situations.“One of the ways that they are picking up this flu or any kennel cough situation is being in situations like dog parks or boarding facilities, grooming facilities,” Carlson said. “You do have to be really careful where you take your dog these days.”If your dog does catch the flu, it should be isolated from other dogs to avoid spread.“They should be quarantined if your dog was around another dog that had the flu,” Carlson said.Copyright 2021 KESQ via CNN Newsource.

Delivered to your inbox Sunday mornings. Sign up This week, the number of people who have died of COVID-19 in the U.S. surpassed the 675,000 said to have died in the 1918-19 influenza pandemic.As of Wednesday morning, 675,071 people in the U.S. had died of COVID-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control; news that prompted some to proclaim COVID-19 now the deadliest pandemic in U.S. history.But there’s a century of time, plus advances in technology, recordkeeping and medical treatment between 1918 and the COVID-19 pandemic that make the claim at least a little dubious. The terrible WThe influenza pandemic of 1918-19 was caused by an H1N1 strain of flu virus and was first discovered in a military facility in Kansas. It was — and still often is — misleadingly referred to as the “Spanish flu” because cases were more widely reported in Spain — neutral in World War I — as opposed to other countries that censored news of the virus’ spread. The flu swept across the world in waves between 1918 and 1919.This flu was exceptionally deadly, and compared to other flus — and notably, COVID-19 — commonly killed young people.“The pandemic in 1918-19 had a mortality graph that epidemiologists call ‘the terrible W’ — it killed a lot of very young people — babies and very young children; it killed a lot of very old people, and then it killed a lot of people who were sort of in their late 20s,” said Susan Jones, a professor and historian at the University of Minnesota who specializes in the historical ecology of disease. The average age of death was 28. [image_credit]Source: "1918 Influenza: the Mother of All Pandemics," by Armed Forces Institute of Pathology researchers and published in the CDC's Emerging Infectious Diseases.[/image_credit]A sad footnote to those young-adult deaths: most of them were caused by bacterial pneumonia. Today, that would be treated with antibiotics and would be unlikely to lead to death. But antibiotics weren’t discovered until a decade after the flu pandemic.Comparing death ratesJust how deadly was the 1918-19 flu pandemic?The U.S. death count of 675,000 accounted for roughly 0.64 percent of the country’s population of 103 million people at the time.With a death toll of 675,071 so far, COVID-19 has killed about 0.2 percent of the 328.2 million people in the U.S. today. In Minnesota, the estimated death toll of the 1918-19 pandemic was more than 10,000, which works out to roughly 0.4 percent of the state’s population at the time, compared to 8,025 deaths due to COVID-19 reported to-date, or 0.14 percent of the state’s population.But the national death toll of 675,000 should be taken with a grain of salt, Jones said.It’s not just that they didn’t have testing that could confirm whether or not someone who died had died of the flu a century ago, Jones said. (Actually, though, because many of the deceased were young people who succumbed to bacterial pneumonia caused by the virus — not a common way for the young to die — flu deaths were often pretty evident.)Another issue? The 675,000 number is based on an extrapolation from incomplete data. [image_credit]Otis Historical Archives, National Museum of Health and Medicine[/image_credit][image_caption]Soldiers from Fort Riley, Kansas, ill with Spanish flu at a hospital ward at Camp Funston.[/image_caption]“Mortality statistics collected in the United States in 1918-19 only covered about 75 [percent] to 80 percent of the population. It covered about 30 states and the District of Columbia,” Jones said. Most of the states that did have organized health departments collecting mortality data were in the North and the Midwest. Swaths of the South and West weren’t collecting these statistics.The person who came up with the 675,000 number took death counts from the states that reported — about 549,000, and added 25 percent to approximate a count for the missing states.Exclusion of those states in the mortality numbers means specific populations are not well-represented in the official death count.“Probably over half of African Americans in this country lived in the states that were not part of the mortality registry,” Jones said. Another group probably underrepresented? Indigenous people, including many living in Minnesota. “We tend to think of mortality statistics today as being absolute numbers that we can really count on and that came from actual data collection. That’s not the case with the 675,000 number, so I guess my point is, we make these things into important numbers — we make these milestones,” Jones said. “Even if we take that number as a pretty good estimate, of course it underestimates what was happening in certain communities.” Democracy depends on independent journalism.

There was a mild wave in the spring, followed by severe outbreak in the fall. One theory is that the first wave primed people’s immune systems, and when it can around again, a hyper immune response caused the problem Log in to Reply Paul Udstrand says: 09/23/2021 at 10:08 am Actually, hyper immune responses are typical symptoms of respiratory infections that cause pneumonia, that was not unique to this infection. The fact that the immune systems of young people can react more aggressively when triggered is most often the explanation for the early fatalities among that demographic. The successive waves were most likely due to new emerging/different variants rather than some worldwide immune response to the same variant (i.e. priming), much the same as new variants have triggered the fourth wave of COVID. I can’t remember the details but a while back there some researchers were digging 1918 flu victims up out of permafrost in Alaska and elsewhere to try to get hold of some virus, and I think they succeeded to some extent, but I don’t think they’ve got enough to reliably type different DNA variations. This stuff is complicated, Here’s one example of a journal article that can give you some insight into this complexity. Basically they authors suggest that the different “waves” of the 1918 flu were actually different flu variants. For instance the first wave may have actually been the last wave of a previous pandemic. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3310443/ Log in to Reply Greg Smith says: 09/30/2021 at 06:41 pm I do this for living, thanks Log in to Reply Rachel Kahler says: 09/22/2021 at 12:55 pm It’s very possible that the 1918/19 flu will remain the most devastating pandemic in American history on a per capita basis. But given the limited tools and a whole lot of other complicating factors (e.g., WWI), it was understandable. After all, look at the infant mortality–it was already a medical and social challenge to keep babies and toddlers alive without a pandemic. Age-adjusted death rate in 1914 (which was a low point ahead of the 1918/19 flu pandemic) was about 2100, while in 2018, it was about 723 (https://www.cdc.govchs/data-visualization/mortality-trends/index.htm), so about 3x what it is today for every day illness in the absence of a pandemic. We’ve come a LONG way medically, so you would expect the mortality rate to be lower in this pandemic due to the increased general health of the population. Also, the complications of the 1918/19 flu include a very obvious one — bacterial pneumonia. It’s easy to identify those people who died of a very specific flu complication; one that we can easily deal with now (with antibiotics). To the extent that COVID-19 patients develop bacterial pneumonia after the initial viral illness, we can and do treat that (unless they don’t have access to healthcare). But COVID-19 has some odd complications. There are excess deaths in a number of different categories, but NOT respiratory illness. This suggests that the 675k dead as a result of COVID-19 is undercounted. And might not ever be counted, depending on the politics of certain offices. And, despite having HUGE medical advantages, including a very effective vaccine, drugs that can reduce an overactive immune response (steroids are very effective treatment for some patients), mechanical solutions (respirators), and even clean and effective hospitals, people are STILL dying of COVID-19. It’s hard to say how many people ultimately will die of COVID-19, but it’s pretty pathetic that we have lost 0.2% of the ENTIRE US population SO FAR. If our goal is to achieve the same death rate as the 1918/19 flu pandemic, we have time. Log in to Reply chris snyder says: 09/23/2021 at 02:08 am Fortunately most covid fatalities now are among the slow-to-learn or oppositional defiant. Some say Darwin is culling the weak from society. My concerns are for overworked healthcare workers (I respect those who’ve quit because of preventable strain, and wonder if they’ll return after we lose some to stress, etc when this settles down – which it will/should/?? unless we get a variant that trumps Delta) and for the cost this is putting on society and economy. Normal people won’t fly or go to restaurants (or work in the public sector) until covid dies down – we’re losing a LOT of businesses because of the unvaccinated. Log in to Reply Rachel Kahler says: 09/23/2021 at 03:28 pm Yeah, it’s the “most” part that bothers me. I have friends/family with suppressed immune systems (transplant recipient, cancer survivors, and those being treated for autoimmune disorders) that, although they have been vaccinated, might not actually be well protected from those who are actively participating in spreading it. In addition, every single person with little or no immunity to this is a potential incubator for a new variant. While the vaccines we have right now appear to be pretty effective against the current strains, especially if the vaccine was administered some time after an infection, that’s not a guarantee that future strains might bypass that immunity. While those strains might not be as deadly, it is also possible they’ll be more deadly. If SARS-COV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is to become endemic, like the flu (which, as a reminder, still kills a significant number of people each year), it’s going to take a few more rounds of variants before our immune systems have a pretty generic recognition. Assuming that immunity is long term.

Main points are that people would have welcomed vaccines back then, when so many in US don’t now. Other is the US seems to have a LOT of brainwashed “Branch Covidians” who’ll do experimental drugsreatments, but not vaccines that have been given to 3.4B people (at least one shot) and 2.5B fully vaccinated worldwide (someone said his 46-year old RN sister died because there wasn’t enough data after giving vaccines to millions of people.. he/she was off by a factor of 1000). Some of them say they’d rather die than get “the shot” and that’s exactly what they’re doing. I also sense we have a LOT more miserable, borderline suicidal people in the US nowadays, which turns the US pandemic into a psychological issue.

She died leaving three orphans as their father had already died in a railroad accident. They were both Finnish immigrants.

It was — and still often is — misleadingly referred to as the “Spanish flu” because cases <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.comopics/medicine-and-dentistry/spanish-influenza">were more widely reported in Spain</a> — neutral in World War I — as opposed to other countries that censored news of the virus’ spread. The flu swept across the world in waves between 1918 and 1919.</p> <p>This flu was exceptionally deadly, and compared to other flus — and notably, COVID-19 — commonly killed young people.</p> <p>“The pandemic in 1918-19 had a mortality graph that epidemiologists call ‘the terrible W’ — it killed a lot of very young people — babies and very young children; it killed a lot of very old people, and then it killed a lot of people who were sort of in their late 20s,” said Susan Jones, a professor and historian at the University of Minnesota who specializes in the historical ecology of disease. The average age of death <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-commemoration/key-messages.htm#:~:text=During%20the%201918%20pandemic%2C%20the,death%20was%2028%20years%20old.">was 28.</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A sad footnote to those young-adult deaths: <a href="https://www.nih.govews-eventsews-releases/bacterial-pneumonia-caused-most-deaths-1918-influenza-pandemic">most of them were caused by bacterial pneumonia</a>. Today, that would be treated with antibiotics and would be unlikely to lead to death. But antibiotics weren’t discovered until a decade after the flu pandemic.</p> <h4>Comparing death rates</h4> <p>Just how deadly was the 1918-19 flu pandemic?</p> <p>The U.S. death count of 675,000 accounted for roughly <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20210329.51293/full/">0.64 percent</a> of the country’s population of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2740912/">103 million</a> people at the time.</p> <p>With a death toll of 675,071 so far, COVID-19 has killed about 0.2 percent of the 328.2 million people in the U.S. today.</p> <p>In Minnesota, the estimated death toll of the 1918-19 pandemic was more than <a href="https://www.mnopedia.org/event/influenza-epidemic-minnesota-1918">10,000</a>, which works out to roughly 0.4 percent of the state’s population at the time, compared to 8,025 deaths due to COVID-19 reported to-date, or 0.14 percent of the state’s population.</p> <p>But the national death toll of 675,000 should be taken with a grain of salt, Jones said.</p> <p>It’s not just that they didn’t have testing that could confirm whether or not someone who died had died of the flu a century ago, Jones said. (Actually, though, because many of the deceased were young people who succumbed to bacterial pneumonia caused by the virus — not a common way for the young to die — flu deaths were often pretty evident.)</p> <p>Another issue? The 675,000 number is based on an extrapolation from incomplete data.</p> <p>“Mortality statistics collected in the United States in 1918-19 only covered about 75 [percent] to 80 percent of the population. It covered about 30 states and the District of Columbia,” Jones said. Most of the states that did have organized health departments collecting mortality data were in the North and the Midwest. Swaths of the South and West weren’t collecting these statistics.</p> <p>The person who came up with the 675,000 number took death counts from the states that reported — about 549,000, and added <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20210329.51293/full/">25 percent to approximate a count for the missing states.</a></p> <p>Exclusion of those states in the mortality numbers means specific populations are not well-represented in the official death count.</p> <p>“Probably over half of African Americans in this country lived in the states that were not part of the mortality registry,” Jones said. Another group probably underrepresented? Indigenous people, including many living in Minnesota.</p> <p>“We tend to think of mortality statistics today as being absolute numbers that we can really count on and that came from actual data collection. That's not the case with the 675,000 number, so I guess my point is, we make these things into important numbers — we make these milestones,” Jones said. “Even if we take that number as a pretty good estimate, of course it underestimates what was happening in certain communities.”</p> <p>This &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.minnpost.com/health/2021/09/why-you-should-be-wary-of-comparisons-of-the-death-tolls-from-the-1918-flu-pandemic-and-covid-19/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; first appeared on &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.minnpost.com&quot;&gt;MinnPost&lt;/a&gt; and is republished here under a Creative Commons license.&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.minnpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/favicon.png&quot; style=&quot;width:1em;height:1em;margin-left:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;republication-tracker-tool-source&quot; src=&quot;https://www.minnpost.com/?republication-pixel=true&amp;post=2067217&amp;amp;ga4=3376753669&quot; style=&quot;width:1px;height:1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt; PARSELY = { autotrack: false, onload: function() { PARSELY.beacon.trackPageView({ url: &quot;https://www.minnpost.com/health/2021/09/why-you-should-be-wary-of-comparisons-of-the-death-tolls-from-the-1918-flu-pandemic-and-covid-19/&quot;, urlref: window.location.href }); } } &lt;/script&gt; &lt;script id=&quot;parsely-cfg&quot; src=&quot;//cdn.parsely.com/keys/minnpost.com/p.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p> Copy to Clipboard 1 Most Read Elections Poll: Harris, Trump remain in tight race in Minnesota as finish line nears by Ana Radelat MNopedia Congress passes the Volstead Act, banning the manufacturing and sale of alcohol, on October 28, 1919 by Rae Katherine Eighmey From Other Nonprofit Media Trump says he’ll move thousands of federal workers out of Washington.

Every season, with a few exceptions, people should look to get vaccinated against flu, according to the CDC. Vaccination is particularly important for people who are at higher risk of serious complications from influenza.September and October are considered the best months to receive the flu vaccine. Flu vaccination has been shown to have important benefits, officials said. It can reduce flu illnesses, doctors’ visits, and missed work and school due to flu, as well as prevent flu-related hospitalizations and deaths.Flu vaccination prevents tens of thousands of hospitalizations each year, according to the CDC. For example, during the 2019 and 2020 flu season, vaccination prevented an estimated 105,000 flu-related hospitalizations.A 2014 study showed that flu vaccination reduced children’s risk of flu-related pediatric intensive care unit admission by 74% during flu seasons from 2010 to 2012.Another study found that through 2009-2016, flu vaccines reduced the risk of flu-associated hospitalization among older adults by roughly 40% on average and reduced flu-vaccinated adults being admitted to an intensive care unit by 82%.Pregnant women can also receive vaccinations and studies have shown that it reduces the risk of flu-associated acute respiratory infection in pregnant women by roughly 50%.Early vaccination can be considered for women in the third trimester of pregnancy. This can help protect their infants during the first months of life when they are still too young to be vaccinated directly.Different flu vaccines are approved for use in different groups of people:RECOMMENDED•masslive.comPregnant whale found dead on beach in HullNov. 8, 2024, 2:22 p.m.Recall: This popular cheese is being recalled in 12 states due to listeriaNov. 7, 2024, 2:49 p.m.There are flu shots approved for use in children as young as 6 months old and flu shots approved for use in adults 65 years and older.Flu shots also are recommended for pregnant people and people with certain chronic health conditions.The nasal spray flu vaccine is approved for use in non-pregnant people who are 2 years through 49 years of age. People who are pregnant and people with certain medical conditions should not receive the nasal spray flu vaccine.However, not everyone should be vaccinated including those with severe, life-threatening allergies to any ingredient in a flu vaccine. Also, people who have had a severe allergic reaction to a dose of influenza vaccine should not get that flu vaccine again and might not be able to receive other influenza vaccines.Egg allergies could be dangerous for those receiving the flu vaccine. Adults, especially those 65 years and older, should generally not get vaccinated early (in July or August) because protection may decrease over time, but early vaccination can be considered for any person who is unable to return at a later time to be vaccinated.If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

"We saw a tremendous decrease in flu cases, so the negative side effect is people don't have immunity now to the flu virus, so what we're going to see is a higher number of more serious cases if we don't get vaccinated."For those children back in schools and who are unable to get the COVID-19 vaccine, doctors said, getting the flu shot should be a priority."Particularly so now as we're seeing children back in schools they're in contact with each other and it's not just COVID you worry about," said Dr. Falcone. "You worry about the flu so we do need to increase the level of vaccination."Dr. Falcone wanted to remind everyone that every year we see people hospitalized and die from the Flu.

(AP Photo/Brynn Anderson)APBy Bloomberg NewsThe number of U.S. COVID-19 deaths has surpassed the toll of the 1918 influenza pandemic, a milestone many experts say was avoidable after the arrival of vaccines.The comparison is imperfect due to a much larger U.S. population today, but the country has reported 675,446 deaths since the start of the pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins University data — more than the 675,000 that are estimated to have died a century earlier.The U.S. hit that deadly mark despite the widespread availability of COVID-19 vaccines, which were developed in record time in a display of the extraordinary advances in medical science in the past century. The inoculations have been passed up by some 70 million eligible Americans, many of them encouraged by Republican politicians and conservative media.“To have so many people who have died with modern medicine is distressing,” said Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Translational Research Institute, who noted there were no ventilators or vaccines in 1918. “The number we are at represents a number that is far worse than it should be in the U.S.”The milestone also comes as the fast-spreading delta variant has pushed the U.S. into a dangerous new phase, upending hopes that the pandemic had passed and setting the stage for an uncertain winter.Of course, the comparisons to the 1918 pandemic are highly imperfect. For starters, the U.S. has about three times as many residents as it had a century ago, meaning the implied death rate is about a third as high.The 1918 pandemic also targeted many young people, whereas Covid has so far mostly killed those 65 and over, and the pandemics have played out at very different paces, according to John Barry, author of “The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History.” He said the 1918 pandemic did the majority of its damage during a 14- to 15-week stretch in the latter part of that year.“That was much more intense, much more frightening,” Barry said of the earlier tragedy. But Barry said the stress from COVID has been longer-lasting, “and the economic damage is light-years greater.”There are other reasons why the numbers may not reflect significant differences. The 675,000 estimate from 1918-19 was based on extrapolations from spotty data. While imperfect in their own ways, COVID-19 statistics are probably better.During extreme events such as pandemics, experts use so-called excess death studies as one way to estimate fatalities — essentially comparing the number of deaths in the outlier period with “normal” times. One excess death estimate from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests there have been as many as 830,443 such fatalities during the COVID-19 pandemic, meaning the official numbers could be an undercount.The unaccounted-for excess deaths may also reflect the price of disruptions in medical care and other indirect byproducts of the pandemic.Vaccinations first rolled out in the U.S. in December and have been widely available for months. Since then, the vast majority of deaths have been among the unvaccinated.“There is so much misinformation out there that some people cannot be convinced” of the benefits of vaccines, said Bertha Hidalgo, an epidemiologist at the University of Alabama. “Those are absolutely the deaths that can be prevented.”RECOMMENDED•oregonlive.comPolice shut down illegal street takeover in North Portland; cars towed, 2 arrestedNov. 6, 2024, 9:26 a.m.Clackamas County Chair Tootie Smith loses reelection bid against Craig RobertsNov. 5, 2024, 11:14 p.m.A CDC study this month found that people who were not fully vaccinated this spring and summer were more than 10 times more likely to be hospitalized, and 11 times more likely to die of COVID-19, than those who were fully vaccinated. While delta’s spread has resulted in more cases among the vaccinated than many anticipated, the vaccine still protects well against severe illness.Topol, the Scripps director, said the U.S. has failed in other ways. Mask use has declined significantly, and most people are still using cloth masks, which have shown to be much less effective than surgical and N95 masks. He said there needs to be widespread distribution of medical-grade masks and rapid at-home Covid tests that can help detect infections early on.“Vaccines are a paramount part of the strategy, but we have failed on other measures as well,” Topol said. “We’re fighting this war with two hands behind our back.”If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

According to experts anyone above the age of 6 months should get the shot. “Vaccines meant for northern hemisphere shall be taken in Kashmir while Jammu and rest of the country gets southern hemisphere vaccines (sic),” Professor and HoD Community Medicine GMC Srinagar Dr S. Muhammad Salim Khan wrote on his twitter handle. Talking to Greater Kashmir Dr Khan said over the last five to six years, many people had been attacked by the H1N1 every year and it was necessary for the people to take a flu shot to protect themselves from the respiratory disease. In Kashmir, he said, people get infected by H1N1 during winters. “People at high risk, elderly and co-morbid should get a flu shot in September itself. It is also necessary for the general population,” he said. He said in the past few years, some patients who were admitted in SKIMS Soura died because of H1N1. “Surprisingly, most of them were young. So keeping in view our past experience we need to remain cautious in advance,” he said. The H1N1 flu, commonly known as swine flu, is primarily caused by the H1N1 strain of the flu (influenza) virus. H1N1 is a type of influenza ‘A’ virus, and H1N1 is one of several flu virus strains that can cause the seasonal flu. Symptoms of the H1N1 flu are the same as those of the seasonal flu. “September is the right time for taking flu shots,” he said. He said people who have already taken both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine can get a flu shot anytime. “Those who are due for the first or second dose can take both the vaccines together on two different arms. Or If they are due for Covid-19 they can wait for two weeks and take it after Covid19 vaccine,” he said. Dr Khan said vaccines do not protect during illnesses so people have to take it before they get attacked by the flu. “Taking a flu shot should be made an annual exercise. Anyone who has done it already some two or three years ago should take a flu shot again,” he said. Leave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.

Photo: AFP via Getty Images/TNSDespite a century of medical advances, more Americans have now died from Covid-19 than the number who succumbed to the 1918 flu pandemic, according to new data.The latest grim milestone comes as the country is experiencing a fourth-wave driven by the highly contagious Delta variant. The low vaccination rate in many regions has been blamed as the main cause of death.Pfizer and BioNTech seek approval to offer vaccine to children under 12A tracker from Johns Hopkins University, an elite university in the US state of Maryland, showed 675,722 US coronavirus deaths as of Friday, which surpasses the 675,000 US deaths during the influenza outbreak that began in the last year of World War I.All told, some 50 million died worldwide in the flu pandemic - sometimes inaccurately referred to as the “Spanish flu” - making it the deadliest event in human history, according to epidemiologists.WHO says to avoid the coronavirus booster shot - for nowThat far exceeds global Covid deaths so far - around 4.7 million.But the United States has borne a disproportionate 14 per cent of those fatalities, despite making up only five per cent of the world’s population.In spite of the high number of deaths, many Americans still protest requiring masks in public places. This photo shows around 200 people protesting a mask mandate for kids in schools in Oakland County, Michigan. Photo: TNSThe American population in 1918 was less than a third of what it is now, meaning the flu deaths would be equivalent to some 2.2 million in today’s terms.Unlike today’s influenzas, which impact children and the elderly the most, the 1918 flu caused unusually high mortality among young adults.The world may never reach herd immunity against CovidAccording to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, with no vaccines and no antibiotics for secondary bacterial complications, control efforts were limited in the 1918-19 to non-pharmaceutical measures.These included “isolation, quarantine, good personal hygiene, use of disinfectants, and limitations of public gatherings,” it said.Many of the same measures, including face masks, were recommended when the Covid pandemic began. Now, however, there are also multiple safe and highly effective vaccines that were developed and tested in record-time - but 24 per cent of US adults, or almost 60 million, haven’t yet got their first dose.Misinformation and politics have brought vaccine hesitancy to historical new heights.Descendants of the H1N1 strain that spread in 1918 at continue to make up the seasonal influenza viruses we fight today, with far less severity.Sign up for the YP Teachers NewsletterGet updates for teachers sent directly to your inboxSubmitBy registering, you agree to our T&C and Privacy PolicyCommentSign up for YP WeeklyGet updates sent directly to your inboxSubmitBy registering, you agree to our T&C and Privacy PolicySign up for YP WeeklyGet updates sent directly to your inboxSubmitBy registering, you agree to our T&C and Privacy Policydiscovernewslifestyleentertainmentadviceyour voicevideoscmp.comLearnreportTEAM YPjournalism resourceslatest reportslearnlearning resourcescollege & uni lifecareer adviceeventssparkStoriesWorksheetstrending topicsHKDSE - Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary EducationHealth and fitnessEnvironmentalLivingRelationshipsStudent lifeCareersEnglish exercisesVideo gamesK-popMental healthCelebritiesMedia literacye-paperYP is a unit of South China Morning Post.SCMPVisit scmp.comAbout UsContact UsWrite for UsPrivacy PolicyTerms & Conditions© 2024 South China Morning Post Publisher Ltd.

The 2021–22 influenza season is expected to coincide with continued circulation of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. JIM NOELKER/STAFFNewsBy Mike RutledgeSept 24, 2021XAmid all the talk about vaccinations to protect against the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s time for another needle — the annual flu shot — health officials and pharmacists are saying.So far, Butler County has had no flu hospitalizations, but with flu season typically arriving in October, it’s time to roll up the sleeves, said Erin Smiley, spokeswoman for the Butler County General Health District.“It’s not a reportable disease, so we don’t know as tests are positive,” she said. “We only get reports of hospitalizations.”During the 2018-2019 flu season, the first hospitalization in the county was in late September. In 2019-2020, the first was in late August, according to county health records. Last flu season was extremely low for flu hospitalizations in the county, with only three all season, mirroring a nationwide trend.Pharmacists in Hamilton and Middletown, who said they were not allowed to comment because of corporate policies, but confirmed they were administering flu vaccines in their stores.It’s a good idea to get vaccinations sooner than later because they typically take about two weeks, depending on a particular year’s inoculations, to take effect, Smiley said.Walgreens in a news release noted people can receive COVID-19 shots and flu vaccinations in the same visit.“Measures like social distancing, mask-wearing, and increased flu vaccinations contributed to very few flu cases last season. However, as communities return to everyday activities amid a surge in COVID-19 cases, it is critical that people remain diligent about getting their flu vaccine,” said Walgreens’ Chief Medical Officer Dr. Kevin Ban.The country again is seeing spikes in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths because of the disease’s delta variant.ExploreAlternative Ohio bill would prevent government-required COVID-19 vaccinations“As COVID-19 cases continue to rise, Walgreens is preparing for the co-circulation of both flu and COVID-19 and eligible patients will be able to receive a flu shot and COVID-19 vaccine in a single visit,” the company said.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends annual flu shots for everyone six months or older unless they have specific health conditions. Ideally, shots should be received by the end of October, but people should receive them as long as the flu is circulating and shots are available, the CDC adds.Some children from 6 months through age 8 require two flu shots. Those children should get their first dose as soon as shots become available, with the second dose about four weeks later. Children who need only one dose can be vaccinated as soon as the shots become available, the CDC says.In Other News1From the publisher: Supporting Food Relief2Large fire on east side of Hamilton involved stacked pallets3Some homeowners going without insurance due to soaring cost4 Woman accused of stabbing her mother to death emotionless during...5 Butler Tech’s $2M welding lab will help train students for in-demand...About the AuthorMike RutledgeHave covered government and politics for 35 years in Ohio and KentuckyCookie SettingsU.S. COVID-19 death toll surpasses total of 1918 Spanish flu pandemic - UPI.com Top News U.S. News World News Featured Odd News Entertainment Movies Music TV Science Health Sports NFL MLB NBA Soccer Voices Photos News US News World News Entertainment Sports Archive Almanac Advertisement U.S. News Sept. 20, 2021 / 7:54 PM U.S. COVID-19 death toll surpasses total of 1918 Spanish flu pandemic By Don Jacobson 1 of 2 | Patients sick with the Spanish flu are hospitalized at a makeshift ward at Camp Funston, Kansas, in 1918. File Photo courtesy of the U.S. Army Sept. 20 (UPI) -- The death toll from COVID-19 surpassed that of the 1918 Spanish flu outbreak Monday, making it the deadliest pandemic in U.S. history, according to a count compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The total number of U.S. deaths from COVID-19 stood at nearly 676,000 as of late Monday afternoon, according to a running tally kept by the university's Center for Systems Science and Engineering. Advertisement That surpasses the 675,000 Americans estimated by U.S. health officials to have died in the Spanish influenza epidemic of 1918-19. The number of deaths worldwide was estimated to be at least 50 million. The John Hopkins data showed COVID-19 is still claiming more than 1,900 lives per day as the United States endures another ongoing wave of infection due to the highly contagious Delta variant.

General Assembly "In terms of raw numbers of deaths, that's a high number," University of Michigan public health expert Howard Markel told the heath news website STAT. "And it's higher still than it should have been, frankly." Many of the lessons from the Spanish flu epidemic may have been lost due to time and the fact that it was such a rare event, he said. Advertisement "We finally now have a modern pandemic," Markel added. "In modern times with modern vaccines and so on. So to me, this is the one I'm going to be teaching my medical students and public health students." The H1N1 virus that caused the 1918 pandemic had genes of avian origin, although there is no universal consensus regarding where it originated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It caused an especially high death rate among healthy people between 15 and 34 years of age and lowered the average life expectancy in the United States by more than 12 years. No vaccines were available to protect against infection and no antibiotics were on hand to treat secondary bacterial infections, meaning that control efforts worldwide were limited to isolation, quarantine, good personal hygiene, use of disinfectants and limits on public gatherings. "Obviously, we have much better advantages now, 100 years later," Dr. Paul Offit, who advises the FDA on COVID-19 vaccines, told CNBC. But, he added, he is "frustrated" with the death toll of the current pandemic, which has been worsened by people refusing to take advantage of effective and freely available vaccines. "I can tell you that we see a lot of children hospitalized as well, who have high-risk conditions and the problem is not that they didn't get their third dose. The problem is that they are unvaccinated," he said.

Credit: David Crigger / Bristol Herald Courier via AP The 2021 flu season is hitting us at the same time that millions of Americans are considering a COVID-19 booster vaccination. The FDA has endorsed a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines by people with certain health conditions that compromise their immune systems, and for people age 65 and older. In August, we spoke with Dr. Anita Skariah, UNC Health internist and pediatrician, to get answers to questions about the need for both flu shots and COVID vaccines. In short, she did recommend getting both the COVID and influenza vaccinations. So we checked back in with her this week to see if recommendations are any different when it comes to getting a COVID booster shot. We recap Skariah’s recommends regarding flu shots, along with new thoughts on COVID vaccines and boosters. Do I need the flu shot if I’ve had the COVID vaccine? Yes, the viruses are different and so are the vaccines. Skariah explains: “It’s important to obtain the flu vaccine even if you have received the COVID vaccine. Neither will protect from the other — the flu vaccine will not protect you against Sars Co-V and the COVID vaccines will not protect you against influenza. “Both are potentially deadly diseases that are preventable with vaccinations.” Is it safe to get the flu shot if I’m getting a vaccine booster? Yes. Skariah tells us that currently, CDC guidance is the same with the booster vaccine. Will the flu shot interfere in any way with the COVID vaccine? No, the flu shot should not interfere in any way with the COVID vaccine, said Skariah. Can I get the flu shot and the COVID vaccine at the exact same time? You can, but you may not want to. “In the past, the CDC had recommended waiting 14 days between COVID vaccines and any other vaccines but now they feel this is unnecessary based on the evidence,” she said. However, Skariah adds that even though taking the shots at the same time or close together is perfectly safe, one might want to space them out “as a matter of personal preference” — especially if worried about side effects. “You may experience mild side effects from each of the vaccines, so if you wanted to separate the two vaccines by two weeks, that would also be reasonable.” When do I need to start thinking about the flu shot? Skariah says the time to start thinking about getting the flu shot is now. “Typically we recommend vaccinating for influenza September through October to be proactive, but you can continue to do so throughout flu season,” Skariah said. “It takes a few weeks to make antibodies once vaccinated, and the efficacy does diminish after six months. This is why we recommend obtaining the vaccine in September or October. In the past, we typically have seen increased influenza cases in October, increasing as the winter progresses and into early spring.” According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, influenza activity usually begins to increase in October, peaking between December and February (although flu season can last as late as May). Could the flu shot give me the flu? Skariah confirms that the flu shot cannot give you the flu. “It is not a live vaccine unless you are given an intra-nasal (nasal spray) formulation, but even the live vaccine cannot cause influenza,” Skariah said. “Flu vaccines are made with killed virus or only a protein from the flu virus.” What are the side effects of a flu shot? You could feel bad after getting the flu shot, the same way you may have felt a reaction to the COVID vaccine. That’s normal, Skariah tells us, but it’s not the flu. “Sometimes after a vaccine you may mount a low grade fever, feel tired, or feel like you are ‘coming down with something,’” Skariah said. “That is actually your immune system’s complex signaling system telling your body to fight off a potential invader. This is how the body builds up antibodies so that if you ever do encounter influenza your body is already armed and ready to fight it off.” Who should get a flu shot? Is there any reason not to? Unless you’ve had a severe allergic reaction to the flu shot in the past, it is recommended that everyone six months old and older get the flu shot, Skariah said. “The only contraindication is if you had a severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine prior,” Skariah said. Even those with egg allergies who may have previously avoided the flu shot can safely receive the shot now, she said. “If the egg allergy was more severe than hives, it should be performed in a medical office, so they can monitor you briefly afterwards. There are also egg-free options available this year, as well, but ask your provider regarding these.” Will the 2021 flu season be worse than last year? Health officials do anticipate a more serious flu season this year when compared to last year. Last year we had record-low flu-related deaths, thanks in large part to people wearing masks and spending most of the flu season working (and socializing) from home. This year, even with the recent delta variant surge, most people are out and about much more than they were last year, so getting a flu shot this year is important.

Full listBut in 1918, during the Spanish flu pandemic, the world was a different place. No one was entirely sure what caused influenza. By the time health authorities began to find out, it was too late.Our knowledge about viruses was limited in 1918, but we knew about bacteria. People who died of flu had bacterial infection in their lungs. However, this threw researchers off track because these were secondary infections, not caused directly by the flu.With this lack of knowledge, it was still an anything-goes medical research world. There were unregulated vaccine trials and lots of hype for the latest "cure", even in respectable medical journals.More than 100 years on, controversial "cures" for COVID-19, such as ivermectin, are making the headlines, being reported in medical journals and are being promoted by doctors and politicians.You Might Also Like:Wide awake at 3am and can't fall back to sleep? Try the biscuit cure or bore yourselfHere's what we know about the Spanish flu "cures" of the day, whisky included.Doctors, pharmacists and nurses had curesDoctors developed and used some of these cures for the flu. Sydney's chief quarantine officer, Dr Reid, treated patients in March 1919 with 15-grain (1 gram) doses of calcium lactate every four hours, and a "vaccine" containing influenza and pneumococcus bacteria. In 203 cases, he had no deaths.Calcium lactate is used today to treat low levels of calcium in the blood. But Dr Reid's doses are well above the current recommended daily level.Chemists were also busy making and selling their own influenza cures. J. Reginald Albert McAlister of Guyra in regional New South Wales advertised his 1919 patented mixture as curing influenza at once.You Might Also Like:World Coconut Day: The solution to your acidity problems is in this fruitPeople even listened to nurses - who at the time were usually the least important people in the health-care system - about cures for the Spanish flu.Nan Taylor, a New Zealand nurse, advocated whisky - lots of it, including gargling and drops up the nose. She also recommended quinine and castor oil.Nurse Kate Guazzini cared for Spanish flu patients in South Africa in late 1918, and caught the flu there before moving to Sydney. She said:I was kept alive on brandy and milk for six weeks [...] That, with quinine and hot lemon drinks, were found to be the only effective remedies.You Might Also Like:Students are under stress due to pandemic. Here's how online mindfulness training can help themFood manufacturers linked themselves to flu cures. In 1919 a brand new beef extract, Bonox, had just hit the Australian market, and the flu epidemic was a great marketing opportunity. Bonox was advertised as a sure way to recover your health and strength after the flu.News of 'cures' spread far and wideIn much of Australia just after WWI there were often no doctors close by. So many people were used to dosing themselves with homemade potions and remedies. They shared their prescriptions in the pages of local newspapers.Between 1918 and 1920, Australian newspapers were flooded with Spanish flu cures of all kinds.In October 1918, a journalist at Victoria's Bendigo Independent lamented:Cures? My goodness me, the vast amount of cures on the market are positively frightening, and everyone has a favorite cure. I pin my faith to one, you to another. There's a certain influenza mixture that, taken in the early stages, is regarded as a certain cure by one large section [...] Asperin [sic] is the cry of another batch of victims, and they tell you that that drug does the trick. 'Try whiskey and milk taken hot and taken often,' is the advice of others who have had it. But one and all end in the same way: 'Go to bed and stay there till the thing leaves you.'Aspirin was very popular as a Spanish flu treatment worldwide. But people sometimes took it at dangerously high doses, which may have boosted the number of deaths attributed to the flu.In the absence of many other treatments, government authorities promoted aspirin, along with quinine and phenacetin.The pain killer phenacetin is now banned because it's linked to kidney and urinary tract cancers.Like aspirin, its overuse might have boosted the Spanish flu death rate.They're using it in AmericaLike today, Australians were also eagerly reading about overseas experiments, and wanting to try these cures locally.In June 1919, the Richmond River Herald reported:On Friday we published the following New York cable: - 'Dr. Charles Duncan, at the Convention of the American Medical Association, said the cure for influenza was one drachm of infected mucus pasteurised and with filtered water injected subcutaneously ... Yesterday (says Tuesday's Tweed 'Daily') a youth was seen inquiring for a chemist, having in his hand the above clipping and sixpence, his object being to secure that amount's worth of the 'cure.' Several others, it is understood, have also been inquiring into the same matter, with a view to 'having it made up' locally.Some of these cures lingeredOnce the Spanish flu pandemic was over, many of the cures remained. Most of them, like aspirin, incorporated the threat of influenza into regular advertising.Some, like quinine, have made a reappearance during the COVID-19 pandemic.And one of the most commonly recommended cures - whisky taken at frequent intervals - hasn't lost its popularity.(This article is syndicated by PTI from The Conversation)You Might Also Like:Covid-19 and hypertension: Reduce sodium intake, cut back on stress to keep BP in checkRead More News onCovid 19Covid vaccinesCovid outbreakCoronavirus outbreakCovid updateSpanish flu(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Gqeberha, South Africa (20 September 2021) – The Gqeberha branch of SANCCOB (Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds) took in 94 African Penguin chicks on the 20th of August. Thirty-eight of the penguins have since regained enough strength and were released back onto Bird Island last weekend, the 11th of September 2021. The good news comes after a tough weekend for the African penguin species in South Africa. Sadly, a colony of penguins at Boulders was swarmed by bees, and over 60 adult penguins died in the swarming. This is a massive knock for the already struggling species. There is no telling yet what this will mean for future rescue efforts, but the Table View Centre is working to prepare for anything. Back to the Gqeberha Centre, they confirmed that while some of the 94 rescues didn’t survive, most of the birds are generally progressing well. “As with such rescue operations, we are always prepared and immediately move into response mode but there are unplanned costs that are incurred. The support from donors and volunteers have been heart-warming and we are grateful to all who have come forward to assist us. We are still in need of financial support to cover the tons of fish for feeding, medication, and rehabilitation provided. Special thanks to Raggy Charters for assisting with our transport needs to and from the Island.” Donations can be made here or by EFT directly to SANCCOB’s bank account. Please select SANCCOB Gqeberha Chick Rescue from the list. African Penguin Awareness Day is on 9 October. In celebration of African Penguin Awareness Day, both centres will host a variety of activities in October. Take a look at how you can get involved below. The funds raised will be used to continue the fight to save the species. Gqeberha, Eastern Cape Sunrise Walk at SANCCOB Gqeberha on Saturday, 9 October at 06h00, from the centre to the Cape Recife Lighthouse and back. The participation fee is R50 and includes an opportunity to tour the Centre and view the seabirds undergoing rehabilitation, buy festive gifts from the SANCCOB shop or have a warm cup of coffee and treat at the Flying Penguin Café.

The award winning public health campaign has helped to increase uptake of the free nasal spray among youngsters, which will be offered to all primary and secondary aged children in local schools over the coming months. This year's campaign sees the publication of a fourth colourful storybook, Flu Fighters On A Vacc-tastic Voyage, which sees our heroes come face to face with their old foes, Chilly, Achy and Snotty, as they take an incredible journey through the human body. Free copies of the book, along with parental consent forms and information about the vaccine, will be given out to all primary school children and their families a few weeks before vaccinations are due in school, with the first books already going out. Parents and guardians are urged to return their completed consent forms as soon as possible to ensure their child doesn't miss out. The book is also available to read online at Flu Fighters On A Vacc-tastic Voyage. Councillor Jasbir Jaspal, the City of Wolverhampton Council's Cabinet Member for Public Health and Wellbeing, said: "We are delighted to be welcoming the Flu Fighters back to Wolverhampton again this year, and they will have a crucial role to play in encouraging high uptake of the free flu vaccine among local children. "Flu can be deadly and easily spread by children and adults. The vaccine is the best way to protect your children and other family members from becoming ill with the flu, particularly more vulnerable relatives like grandparents or those with underlying health conditions and, with Covid-19 still with us, it’s even more important that people protect themselves from other viruses this year. "The vaccination is quick and safe and it's also painless for children because it is given via a quick squirt up the nose, so youngsters have no need to worry about any nasty needles. "I would urge parents to return their consent forms as soon as they receive them so that their children can get their free vaccine and become a Flu Fighter!" Sally Roberts, Chief Nurse for the Black Country and West Birmingham Clinical Commissioning Group, said: "The importance of the flu vaccine in protecting our children from the effects of severe flu cannot be underestimated. It is also very valuable in preventing the spread of harmful germs within the community. "The Flu Fighters campaign has really helped raise awareness amongst children and parents leading to an extremely good response to the annual vaccination programme. I would urge all parents to ensure that their children are appropriately protected by consenting for them to have the vaccine, because it is better safe than sorry." Primary and secondary aged children will be offered the nasal spray through their school. The nasal spray is also available to children aged 2 and 3, and children with some long term health conditions, through their GP. To find out more about the vaccine, read the answers to frequently asked questions and to download free copies of the first 3 Flu Fighters stories – Flu Fighters Versus Chilly, Achy and Snotty; Flu Fighters in The Battle of Planet Bogey; and Flu Fighters in Close Encounters of the Germed Kind – please visit Flu Vaccines.

The flu jab will help to boost immunity over the winter months to help people protect themselves, their family and friends from the virus. Every year the NHS calls people who are eligible to get the jab and this year it is more important than ever. Dr Robert Westgate, Carlisle GP, said: “People shouldn’t delay in getting their flu vaccination as flu changes every year and it is a simple procedure which could ultimately save lives. “Obviously with the huge COVID-19 vaccination programme this year it has really put vaccinations into the spotlight and inspired many discussions, but we have been really encouraged by the excellent take-up rate in north Cumbria. People should remember that the flu jab is dealing with a different virus so getting the jab will help to boost their immune system further. “We are asking people who are eligible for the free flu jab to ensure they get it as soon as possible, as influenza will of course be in circulation as well as COVID-19. “Influenza can be debilitating, especially if you are already living with a long-term condition, either very young or very old, or have other risk factors.” Extremely contagious Flu is an extremely contagious respiratory illness caused by the influenza A or B viruses. It is an unpredictable virus that can cause mild illness in most people but some people are more likely to develop potentially serious complications of flu such as bronchitis and pneumonia. Hospital, community and mental health NHS staff will be called by their organisation and those working in social care will be supported to get the jab by their organisation. If you are eligible for the covid booster jab – which was announced last week – you will be contacted by the NHS. Do not call your practice to book a COVID-19 vaccine booster. Flu jabs can also be given by your local pharmacist, so people can make enquiries with them about available appointments. Many GP surgeries will already be in contact with many of their most ‘at risk’ patients to arrange suitable appointments and some surgeries will also be running special flu clinics to offer more opportunities and will share any dates with patients accordingly. The expanded flu vaccination programme that successfully took place last year also continues this year (2021 to 2022 winter season) which means the offer for 50 to 64-year-olds to also receive a free flu jab will continue, helping to protect this age group. Groups eligible for a free NHS flu jab, in the 2021 to 2022 season include: all children aged two to 15 (but not 16 years or older) on August 31 – who will be offered a nasal spraythose aged six months to under 50 years in clinical risk groupspregnant womenthose aged 50 years and overthose in long-stay residential care homescarersclose contacts of immunocompromised individualsfrontline health and social care staff employed by:a registered residential care or nursing homeregistered domiciliary care providera voluntary managed hospice providerDirect Payment (personal budgets) and/or Personal Health Budgets, such as Personal Assistants. Dr Westgate added: “NHS staff and frontline health and social care workers are also encouraged to get the jab which will help to protect patients, colleagues and their families. “There is obviously a great deal of pressure on health and care systems at the moment so people getting their flu jab is another important step people can take to help us to help you through the busy winter season. “It’s also worth noting that there is also an option of a nasal vaccination available for children, ensuring that they are protected with this painless and effective process.” Studies have shown that flu vaccinations will help prevent people from getting flu. It provides protection against strains of flu that are predicted to circulate each year, as these strains may be different from previous years. Although the vaccine won’t stop all flu viruses and the level of protection may vary from person to person. If you do get flu after vaccination it is likely to be milder and shorter-lived than it otherwise might have been.
