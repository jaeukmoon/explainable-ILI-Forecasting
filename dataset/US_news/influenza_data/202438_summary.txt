Vaccine Importance and Myths: Pregnant individuals are at higher risk of severe flu illness, making flu vaccination important for both their health and the health of their developing baby. The flu shot is safe for pregnant people and can protect against flu-related hospitalizations. Vaccination during pregnancy also provides passive immunity to newborns. Misconceptions, such as the need for special permission for flu vaccination, should be addressed to ensure high vaccination coverage among pregnant individuals.
Vaccine Coverage and Vulnerable Populations: Pregnant individuals, especially those with pre-existing medical conditions, should receive the flu shot. Special permission or written consent from a healthcare professional is not necessary for flu vaccination in non-medical settings. The nasal spray flu vaccine is not recommended for pregnant individuals.
Best Timing for Vaccination: September and October are generally good times for adults to receive the flu shot. Pregnant individuals in their third trimester can consider vaccination in July and August to protect their infants after birth.
Vaccine Protection: Getting a flu vaccine is the most effective way to protect against flu and its complications. Vaccination is especially important for pregnant individuals to safeguard their own health and their newborns. The flu shot, not the nasal spray flu vaccine, is recommended for pregnant individuals.
