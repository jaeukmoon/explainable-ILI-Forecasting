1. The maintenance of surveillance for influenza and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is crucial during the COVID-19 pandemic.

2. The Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) and sentinel systems are being adapted to monitor the circulation of both influenza and COVID-19.

3. Practical information is provided to countries on how to maintain surveillance for influenza and monitor COVID-19 using existing systems.

4. Considerations are given for addressing disruptions in influenza sentinel surveillance and extending it to include surveillance for COVID-19.

5. Updated algorithms for testing for both influenza and COVID-19 in surveillance are included in the guidance.

6. The guidance is designed to help countries monitor the relative circulation of influenza and COVID-19 viruses.
