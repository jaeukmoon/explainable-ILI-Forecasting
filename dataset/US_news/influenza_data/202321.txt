Here, using the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) in a melanoma model, we demonstrate a chimeric antigenic peptide influenza virus (CAP-Flu) system for delivery of antigenic peptides bound to influenza A virus (IAV) to the lung. We conjugated attenuated IAVs with the innate immunostimulatory agent CpG and, after intranasal administration to the mouse lung, observed increased immune cell infiltration to the tumor. OVA was then covalently displayed on IAV-CPG using click chemistry. Vaccination with this construct yielded robust antigen uptake by dendritic cells, a specific immune cell response and a significant increase in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes compared to peptides alone. Lastly, we engineered the IAV to express anti-PD1-L1 nanobodies that further enhanced regression of lung metastases and prolonged mouse survival after rechallenge. Engineered IAVs can be equipped with any tumor neoantigen of interest to generate lung cancer vaccines.

Data comparing the impact of these viruses can be found in two new dashboards: RESP-NET and NSSP’s Emergency Department Visits for COVID-19, Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus. Key Updates for Week 20, ending May 20, 2023Seasonal influenza activity remains low nationally. This is the last full FluView report of the 2022-2023 season. An abbreviated report will be published during the summer, and the first full report of the 2023-2024 season will be published on October 13, 2023. Viruses Clinical Lab1.1% (Trend ) positive for influenza this week Public Health LabInfluenza B viruses were the most frequently reported this week. Virus CharacterizationGenetic and antigenic characterization and antiviral susceptibility are summarized in this report. Illness Outpatient Respiratory Illness2.0% (Trend ) of visits to a health care provider this week were for respiratory illness (below baseline). Outpatient Respiratory Illness: Activity MapThis week 1 jurisdiction experienced moderate activity and 2 jurisdictions experienced high activity. Geographic SpreadBecause of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, this system will suspend data collection for the 2020-21 influenza season. Long-term Care Facilities0.3% (Trend ) of facilities reported ≥ 1 influenza-positive test among residents this week. FluSurv-NET62.6 per 100,000 cumulative hospitalization rate HHS Protect Hospitalizations939 (Trend ) patients admitted to hospitals with influenza this week. NCHS Mortality6.5% (Trend ) of deaths attributed to pneumonia, influenza, or COVID-19 this week (above threshold). Pediatric Deaths2 deaths were reported this week for a total of 154 so far this season All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received. Directional arrows indicate changes between the current week and the previous week. Additional information on the arrows can be found at the bottom of this page. A description of the CDC influenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each data component is available on the surveillance methods page. Additional information on the current and previous influenza seasons for each surveillance component are available on FluView Interactive. Key Points Seasonal influenza activity remains low nationally. This week is the last full version of FluView for the 2022-2023 influenza season. Starting with week 21, an abbreviated summer version of FluView will be published. The full version is expected to resume for week 40 of 2023, which is the start of the 2023-2024 influenza season. Nationally, outpatient respiratory illness is below baseline, and eight of 10 HHS regions are below their respective baselines. The number of flu hospital admissions remains low. During week 20, 36.1% of the 36 viruses reported by public health laboratories were influenza A and 63.9% were influenza B. All six influenza A viruses detected and subtyped during week 20 were influenza A(H1N1). Two influenza-associated pediatric death that occurred during the 2022-2023 season were reported this week, for a total of 154 pediatric flu deaths reported so far this season. CDC estimates that, so far this season, there have been at least 27 million illnesses, 300,000 hospitalizations, and 19,000 deaths from flu. The majority of influenza viruses tested are in the same genetic subclade as and antigenically similar to the influenza viruses included in this season’s influenza vaccine. All viruses collected and evaluated this season have been susceptible to the influenza antivirals peramivir, zanamivir, and baloxavir, and all viruses except for one (> 99.9%) have been susceptible to the influenza antiviral oseltamivir. CDC continues to recommend that everyone ages 6 months and older get an annual flu vaccine as long as flu activity continues. U.S. Virologic Surveillance Nationally, the percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories remained stable (change of <0.5 percentage points). For regional and state level data and age group distribution, please visit FluView Interactive. Viruses known to be associated with recent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) receipt or found upon further testing to be a vaccine virus are not included, as they are not circulating influenza viruses. Clinical Laboratories The results of tests performed by clinical laboratories nationwide are summarized below. Data from clinical laboratories (the percentage of specimens tested that are positive for influenza) are used to monitor whether influenza activity is increasing or decreasing. results of tests from Clinical Laboratories Week 20 Data Cumulative since October 2, 2022(Week 40) No. of specimens tested 31,894 3,395,600 No. of positive specimens (%) 355 (1.1%) 352,572 (10.4%) Positive specimens by type Influenza A 108 (30.4%) 345,544 (98.0%) Influenza B 247 (69.6%) 7,028 (2.0%) View Chart Data | View Full Screen Public Health Laboratories The results of tests performed by public health laboratories nationwide are summarized below.

These data are used to compare how similar the currently circulating influenza viruses are to the reference viruses representing viruses contained in the current influenza vaccines. The data are also used to monitor evolutionary changes that continually occur in influenza viruses circulating in humans. CDC genetically characterized 2,912 influenza viruses collected since October 2, 2022. To reflect the genetic diversity of the HA genes in recent A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses, new subclades have been designated. The vast majority of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses collected in the U.S. this season express HA genes belonging to 6B.1A.5a.2, but this clade has been split into the 2a and 2a.1 subclades. All A(H3N2) viruses collected thus far in the U.S. this season express HA genes belonging to clade 3C.2a1b.2a.2, and this clade has been split into multiple subclades. The new subclade designations improve the ability to track the evolution and co-circulation of multiple groups of influenza viruses.

Antigenic differences between viruses are determined by comparing how well the antibodies made against the vaccine reference viruses recognize the circulating viruses that have been grown in cell culture. Ferret antisera are useful because antibodies raised against a particular virus can often recognize small changes in the surface proteins of other viruses. In HI assays, viruses with similar antigenic properties have antibody titer differences of less than or equal to 4-fold when compared to the reference (vaccine) virus. In HINT, viruses with similar antigenic properties have antibody neutralization titer differences of less than 8-fold. Viruses selected for antigenic characterization are a subset representing the genetic changes in the surface proteins seen in genetically characterized viruses. Influenza A Viruses A (H1N1)pdm09: Three hundred and fourteen A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were antigenically characterized by HI, and 310 (99%) were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Wisconsin/588/2019-like reference viruses representing the A(H1N1)pdm09 component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines. A (H3N2): Two hundred and twenty-five A(H3N2) viruses were antigenically characterized by HINT, and 212 (94%) were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 8-fold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera to cell-grown A/Darwin/6/2021-like reference viruses representing the A(H3N2) component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines. Influenza B Viruses B/Victoria: Fifty-eight influenza B/Victoria-lineage virus were antigenically characterized by HI, and all were well-recognized (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera to cell-grown B/Austria/1359417/2021-like reference viruses representing the B/Victoria component for the cell- and recombinant-based influenza vaccines. B/Yamagata: No influenza B/Yamagata-lineage viruses were available for antigenic characterization. Assessment of Virus Susceptibility to Antiviral Medications CDC assesses susceptibility of influenza viruses to antiviral medications including the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir) and the PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir using next generation sequence analysis supplemented by laboratory assays. Information about antiviral susceptibility test methods can be found at U.S. Influenza Surveillance: Purpose and Methods | CDC. Viruses collected in the U.S. since October 2, 2022, were tested for antiviral susceptibility as follows: susceptibility of influenza viruses to the antiviral medications Antiviral Medication Total Viruses A/H1 A/H3 B/Victoria B/Yamagata Neuraminidase Inhibitors Oseltamivir Viruses Tested 2,904 1,059 1,630 215 0 Reduced Inhibition 1 (<0.1%) 1 (0.1%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) Highly Reduced Inhibition 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) Peramivir Viruses Tested 2,904 1,059 1,630 215 0 Reduced Inhibition 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) Highly Reduced Inhibition 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) Zanamivir Viruses Tested 2,904 1,059 1,630 215 0 Reduced Inhibition 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) Highly Reduced Inhibition 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) PA Cap-Dependent Endonuclease Inhibitor Baloxavir Viruses Tested 2,820 1,016 1,593 211 0 Reduced Susceptibility 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) One A(H1N1)pdm09 virus had NA-S247G amino acid substitution and showed reduced inhibition by oseltamivir. Outpatient Respiratory Illness Surveillance The U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) monitors outpatient visits for respiratory illness referred to as influenza-like illness [ILI (fever plus cough or sore throat)], not laboratory-confirmed influenza, and will therefore capture respiratory illness visits due to infection with any pathogen that can present with similar symptoms, including influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and RSV. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, health care-seeking behaviors have changed, and people may be accessing the health care system in alternative settings not captured as a part of ILINet or at a different point in their illness than they might have before the pandemic. Therefore, it is important to evaluate syndromic surveillance data, including that from ILINet, in the context of other sources of surveillance data to obtain a complete and accurate picture of influenza, SARS-CoV-2, and other respiratory virus activity. CDC is tracking COVID-19 activity in a weekly publication called COVID Data Tracker Weekly Review. Information about other respiratory virus activity can be found on CDC’s National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) website. Outpatient Respiratory Illness Visits Nationwide during week 20, 2.0% of patient visits reported through ILINet were due to respiratory illness that included fever plus a cough or sore throat, also referred to as ILI. This has remained stable (change of ≤ 0.1 percentage points) compared to week 19 and is below the national baseline of 2.5%. Eight of 10 HHS regions are below their respective baselines; Region 2 is above its baseline, and Region 9 is at its baseline. Multiple respiratory viruses are co-circulating, and the relative contribution of influenza virus infection to ILI varies by location. * Effective October 3, 2021 (week 40), the ILI definition (fever plus cough or sore throat) no longer includes “without a known cause other than influenza.” View Chart Data (current season only) | View Full Screen Outpatient Respiratory Illness Visits by Age Group More than 70% of ILINet participants provide both the number of patient visits for respiratory illness and the total number of patient visits for the week broken out by age group. Data from this subset of providers are used to calculate the percentages of patient visits for respiratory illness by age group. The percentage of visits for respiratory illness reported in ILINet remained stable (change of ≤ 0.1 percentage point) for all age groups (0-4 years, 5-24 years, 25-49 years, 50-64 years, and 65+ years) in week 20 compared to week 19.

FluSurv-NET hospitalization data are preliminary. As data are received each week, prior case counts and rates are updated accordingly. A total of 18,306 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations were reported by FluSurv-NET sites between October 1, 2022, and April 30, 2023. The weekly hospitalization rate observed in week 17 the last week of FluSurv-NET enrollment for the 2023-2024 season, was 0.2 per 100,000 population. The weekly rate observed during week 48 (week ending December 3, 2022) is the third highest peak weekly rate observed during all seasons going back to 2010-2011; this follows the 2017-2018 season, which peaked during week 1 (week ending January 6, 2018) and the 2014-2015 season, which peaked during week 52 (week ending December 27, 2014). The overall cumulative hospitalization rate was 62.6 per 100,000 population. This cumulative hospitalization rate is similar to the hospitalization rates for 4 seasons (2014-2015, 2016-2017, 2018-2019, and 2019-2020 seasons) and lower than the hospitalization rate for the 2017-2018 season, going back to 2010-2011. When examining rates by age, the highest rate of hospitalization per 100,000 population was among adults aged 65 and older (186.8). Among adults aged 65 and older, rates were highest among adults aged 85 and older (102.1). Among persons aged <65 years, hospitalization rates per 100,000 population were highest among children aged 0-4 years (80.4), followed by adults aged 50-64 years (68.0). When examining rates by race and ethnicity, the highest rate of hospitalization per 100,000 population was among non-Hispanic Black persons (88.5), followed by non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native persons (82.7), Hispanic/Latino persons (55.6), non-Hispanic White persons (54.1), and non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander persons (27.7). Among 18,306 hospitalizations, 17,487 (95.5%) were associated with influenza A virus, 649 (3.5%) with influenza B virus, 30 (0.2%) with influenza A virus and influenza B virus co-infection, and 140 (0.8%) with influenza virus for which the type was not determined. Among 4,564 hospitalizations with influenza A subtype information, 3,412 (74.8%) were A(H3N2), and 1,152 (25.3%) were A(H1N1)pdm09. Based on preliminary data, of the 5,689 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations with more complete data, 3.7% (95% CI: 3.1%-4.4%) also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Among 3,926 hospitalized adults with information on underlying medical conditions, 97.0% had at least one reported underlying medical condition, the most commonly reported were hypertension, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorder, and obesity. Among 1,422 hospitalized women of childbearing age (15-49 years) with information on pregnancy status, 36.8% were pregnant. Among 1,385 hospitalized children with information on underlying medical conditions, 66.4% had at least one reported underlying medical condition; the most commonly reported was asthma, followed by neurologic disease, and obesity. While patients admitted after April 30, 2023, will not be included, data on patients admitted through April 30, 2023, will continue to be updated as additional information is received.

The upcoming General Session of the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) will bring together international experts and government representatives to discuss the current challenges and opportunities in tackling this major threat. Over 500 million birds have died from avian influenza since 2005. The deadly bird disease has devastating consequences on the health of domestic and wild birds, as well as on biodiversity and livelihoods. Lately, the global spread of avian influenza has raised growing preoccupation with an unprecedented number of outbreaks reaching new geographical regions, unusual die-offs in wild birds, as well as an increasing number of cases in mammals. Despite countries’ efforts to implement surveillance as well as strict prevention and control measures—such as movement control, enhanced biosecurity, and stamping-out—avian influenza continues to spark concern among the international community. Towards a paradigm shift in current avian influenza prevention and control measures? The extent and severity of the situation requires the assessment of existing strategies to contain the disease and raises multiple questions. What are the gaps in current disease control strategies? How can they be better tailored to different contexts and settings? Do we need to rethink about the way we rear some poultry species? How can we ensure an early detection of outbreaks? Which complementary control options would be needed at country and regional level? Would the wider use of vaccination in birds be a sustainable solution? How can poultry and poultry products trade take place safely in the presence of vaccination? How to best optimise resources allocation? To address the strategic questions and challenges that impede countries to progress towards the global control of the disease, WOAH will hold its first ever Animal Health Forum dedicated to discuss the topic on 22-23 May, in the framework of the 90th General Session. The Forum will introduce the Technical Item as a common thread and will provide one-of-a-kind chance to take stock of past and current strategies and explore other risk management options, more adapted to the current evolving situation. It will also be a unique opportunity to agree on suitable, science-based alternatives for disease surveillance and control, that can reduce the impact of the disease. New concerns arise as the disease evolves These past years, an unprecedented and broader range of virus strains has emerged, leading to further evolution of the viruses and thus creating an epidemiologically challenging landscape. Historically, the most severe form of the disease in poultry, high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI), used to mostly spread from farm to farm, while its low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) used to mainly circulate among wild birds, often remaining asymptomatic in these bird populations. Nowadays, we observe a persistent threat of HPAI encroaching into wild birds, which can carry the disease viruses over long distances and across country borders. Avian influenza has therefore spread rapidly to new regions, in particular in Central and South America where the disease had not been detected for 20 years. In this region, 10 countries reported the disease to WOAH. Whereas, at global level, 74 countries and territories have notified avian influenza outbreaks since October 2021; this wide geographical spread has no previous historical context. Beyond the increased number of cases identified in poultry and wild birds in recent years, avian influenza is now being reported in wild and captive mammals. Recent cases in otters, foxes and mink have sparked animal and public health concerns pertaining to the risk of viruses becoming more adapted to mammals and what this means to humans. Sporadic, but severe human cases have also occurred. Although transmission from birds to humans is rare and results from repeated exposure to infected birds, the risk of a pandemic remains. Building an effective common response Avian influenza is a serious threat to global health, livelihoods, food security, and biodiversity. While there have been significant efforts to prevent and control its spread, there is still much work to be done. The change of epidemiology of the disease these past two years has undermined the use of stamping-out as a main control measure. As we are looking for more sustainable production practices, we must explore collectively alternative methods of disease control, to prevent and mitigate the disease, and consequently, avoid destroying so many animals when food security is becoming a critical issue for many. These strategic challenges will be extensively discussed during the upcoming Animal Health Forum on avian influenza. In particular, the topics of surveillance, disease control strategies, ways to ensure safe and fair international trade of poultry and poultry products and regional and global coordination will be debated. These important discussions will result in the development of international recommendations and will provide a solid basis for the rehaul of the WOAH/FAO global strategy on high pathogenicity avian influenza developed under the umbrella of the GF-TADs. We need to ensure that countries can respond to this major health threat under a common framework and that their governments are ready to mobilise sufficient resources to tackle avian influenza. Taking appropriate action will be critical to ensure, a safer, healthier future for everyone.

Since the influenza virus evolves yearly, a vaccine which is independent from viral antigenic mutation is desired. We have developed chimeric cytokine (CC) and hemagglutinin (HA) incorporated virus-like particle (CCHA-VLP) as a universal influenza vaccine candidate. Using mouse models, it was shown that the vaccine provided broad-based protective activity against several types of human and avian influenza A viruses. In this report, nasal immunization and mixture form (CC- and HA-VLP) were tested to improve usability of this vaccine. Immunogenicity was evaluated by induction of IgG, IgA, and IFN-γ secreting cells. Protective activity was measured as mouse survival rate against lethal challenge with H1N1 and H5N1 viruses and against H3N2 virus by lung viral titer. Nasal immunization showed low immunogenicity and low protective efficacy, but the addition of a sesame oil adjuvant improved vaccine efficacy. Mixture form of CC- and HA-VLP showed comparable or higher vaccine efficacy when compared to the incorporated form, CCHA-VLP. These results contribute to improved usability, such as needle-less administration and easy HA subtypes alteration. IntroductionInfluenza virus is one of the major pathogens of acute respiratory infection and can cause acute pneumonia. It is estimated that seasonal influenza results in 870,000 hospitalizations and 15,000 acute lower respiratory tract disease related deaths in children younger than 5 years of age, and 5.7 million adult hospitalizations [1, 2]. Antiviral drugs are widely used to reduce the severity of influenza symptoms and shorten the time of illness, however, vaccination is still the most effective countermeasure to control for mitigating the influenza epidemic. The current licensed influenza vaccines target the viral surface hemagglutinin (HA) protein which is highly antigenic. Between 2004 and 2020, vaccine effectiveness ranged from 10 to 60% in USA, and varied due to antigenic mismatch with circulating strains [3]. The influenza virus often evolves via antigenic mutation which confers immune-escape and low vaccine efficacy. Therefore, current research focuses on the development of a universal influenza vaccine that targets conserved viral regions and is effective against various influenza strains. Several universal influenza vaccine candidates have been developed using various strategies. For example, a matrix 2 (M2) protein-based vaccine was developed, as it is highly conserved across influenza subtypes, and induced an immune response against various types of influenza subtypes [4, 5]. In addition, inducing T cell immunity is an effective method to induce broad-based immunity [6]. Therefore, we focused on M2 peptide and interleukin (IL)-12 which stimulates T cell response, and constructed chimeric cytokine (CC) consisting of M2, neuraminidase (NA) stalk and IL-12 in previous study, then produced virus-like particles (VLPs) containing CC and HA proteins. The VLP vaccine efficacy was evaluated in mice and was shown to induce broad-based immunity against homologous heterologous influenza serotypes [7]. However, there were several VLP-related problems, such as difficulty adjusting for HA and CC quantity separately because these proteins were incorporated in same particle together. If the HA and CC proteins are not required to express on the surface of same VLP for vaccine efficacy, it is possible to adjust quantity of each protein separately, leading to improve the usability of the vaccine.Most vaccines are administered via subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, however, it is estimated that one in four adults and two in three children fear injection [8]. Therefore, there is a need to identify alternate immunization routes, such as nasal or oral routes. Nasal immunization is suitable for influenza vaccine since it would be efficiently recognized by antigen presenting cells whereas via the oral route, the vaccine would be exposed to digestive enzymes in the stomach. It has been previously reported that mucosal immunity, such as nasal IgA, was induced by nasal influenza vaccine immunization [9]. In 2003, an intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccine was approved for use in the United States, and the effectiveness is comparable to that of the standard inactivated vaccine [10]. Because of these advantages, trying intranasal immunization would be benefitable for development of our VLP vaccine.As mentioned above, intraperitoneal injection of our vaccine successfully induced broad-based immunity, in mice, against influenza A virus subtypes [7]. However, there was still room to improve the usability. In this study, we aimed to improve the usability of our developed vaccine and evaluated different immunization routes, such as intranasal administration. In addition, we evaluated immunization with the mixture of HA- and CC-VLPs.MethodsProducing and purifying recombinant VLPsThe CC-, (Fukushima H5) FkH5-, CCFkH5-VLP were produced as described previously [7]. Briefly, FkH5-HA and CC coding nucleotide sequences were incorporated into the Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) genome using the bac-to-bac baculovirus vector system. The FkH5 HA sequence was derived from the Aufted duck/Fukushima/16/2011/(H5N1) strain (GenBank accession number: AB629698). Recombinant viruses, FkH5-AcNPV and CC-AcNPV were co-inoculated or separately infected into Eri-silkworm pupae, obtained from Dr. Kajiura in Shinshu university. Infected pupae were collected nine days post-infection. Pupae were homogenized and purified by ultracentrifugation and sucrose cushion centrifugation. The resultant VLP solution was used for immunization. HA protein was quantified using the hemagglutination test and CC was expressed as IL-12 which was quantified using the Lebis mouse IL-12 ELISA assay kit (Fuji film Wako, Osaka, Japan), according to the manufacture’s protocol.Hemagglutination testTwo-fold serial dilutions of the virus and VLP samples were performed with PBS as the diluent. Then, chicken red blood cell suspension (0.5%) was dropped into the sample, mixed, and incubated for 1 h. Following incubation, the HA titer was determined.Mouse immunization and virus challengeSix week-old female BALB/c mice were purchased from SLC Japan. CCFkH5-VLP was administered to the mice three times on days 0, 7 and 14 with using three administration methods: (1) intraperitoneal route, (2) intranasal route and (3) intranasal route with a sesame oil adjuvant. In addition, to evaluate the necessity to incorporate CC and HA in single VLPs, the mixture of CC- and FkH5-VLPs was administered to mice via the intraperitoneal route. Each aliquot contained approximately 25,000 HA units and 50 ng of IL-12 protein in 200 µL for intraperitoneal injection or in 50 µL for intranasal immunization. Seven days following the third immunization, mice were infected with A/Puerto Rico/8/1934/H1N1 (PRH1), A/Aichi/2/1968/H3N2 (AiH3) or low pathogenic avian influenza (vaccine seed) viruses, RG-A/Barn Swallow/Hong Kong/1161/2010-A/PR/8/34 H5N1 [R] (6 + 2) (HKH5). The PRH1 and HKH5 infected mice were monitored for two weeks and their health condition and body weight were observed. The AiH3 infected group was euthanized four days post infection (dpi). Since low mortality was observed in this group, the lung tissue viral titer was measured using the plaque assay. Ten weeks-old BALB/c mice infected with PRH1, AiH3 or HKH5 virus served as the unvaccinated control groups and viral pathogenicity was evaluated. To analyze the induction of humoral and cell immunity, immunized mice were euthanized seven days post immunization and unvaccinated mice were used as control group. Serum, nasal and vaginal wash and spleen were collected from these mice to use for subsequent assays. Nasal and vaginal wash was obtained immediately after euthanasia by washing nasal cavity and vagina with 100 µL of PBS. Immunization and virus challenge experiments were performed with groups of five mice per each.Plaque forming assayConfluent Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells were inoculated with serial ten-fold dilutions of the sample serum in a multi-well plate and incubated for 1 h at 37 ℃. Agar (0.9%)-containing 1x MEM and trypsin was overlayed and infected cells were incubated for three days at 37 ℃ and 5% CO2. After fixation with 10% formalin, the agar was removed and the cells were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB). The number of plaques generated was counted visually and the viral titer was calculated as plaque forming units per volume (PFU)/mL.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)Anti-FkH5 and anti-M2 IgA were evaluated using ELISA. The FkH5-VLP suspension was mixed with Triton-X100 (0.1%) and incubated for 5 min. FkH5 concentration was measured using the pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA), according to the manufacture’s protocol. Coating solutions were prepared with the abovementioned FkH5 solution, M2e peptide (GenScript, Piscataway, USA), and adjusted to 30 µg/mL and 5 µg/mL, respectively with 0.1 M carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.5). The coating solutions (100 µL) were added into wells of a Nunc-Immuno plate II (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and incubated overnight at 4 ºC. The coating solution was removed and the plate wells were washed with PBS supplemented with 0.05% tween 20, and blocked with block ace (KAC, Kyoto, Japan) for 30 min at room temperature. Following a PBS wash, the tested sera were added into the wells and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Plates were washed and coated in goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) antibody, HRP conjugate (Proteintech group, Inc., Rosemont, USA) or Goat anti-mouse IgA-HRP (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, USA) in 1:10,000 dilution and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Following washing, 1-step TMB ELISA substrate (Thermo Fisher Sientific) was used, according to the manufacture’s protocol. The optical density at 450 nm (OD450) of each well was measured with Multiskan Sky High Microplate Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Each group was compared based on relative OD450 which was calculated as OD450 of each sample was divided by the mean of unvaccinated control group.Mouse IFN-γ ELISpot assaySplenocytes were prepared as previously described [7]. Briefly, collected spleen was homogenized and purified by centrifugation using NH4Cl as the hemolytic agent. The cells were fractionated with a 40 μm pore cell strainer and stored at -80 ℃. Collected mouse splenocytes were added at to plates at 105 cells/well and stimulated with 16 HA titers of the H5N1 virus for 24 h. IFN-γ–secreting cells were detected using mouse IFN-γ Single-Color ELISpot (Cellular Technology Limited, Cleveland, USA), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Spots were stained, counted, and calculated as the number of IFN-γ–secreting cells per million splenocytes. Samples that did not contain 105 cells/well at incubation with antigen were excluded from analysis. Therefore, the number of data in each group was five (unvac, CCFkH5 IP, CC + FkH5 IP) and four (CCFkH5 IN, CCFkH5 + SO IN).Statistical analysisTo compare the ELISA and viral titer data across groups, statistical analysis was performed using Welch’s test and R software version 3.6.2 [11]. P-values were adjusted by Bonferroni method and a value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsInduction of IgG and IgA in serum and mucosal samplesAnti-FkH5 IgG and anti-M2 IgG in serum and anti-FkH5 IgA in mucosal samples induced by each immunization method were measured by ELISA (Fig. 1). In the serum samples, intraperitoneal and intranasal methods significantly induced anti-FkH5 IgG (Fig. 1a), and a mixture of CC- and FkH5-VLPs immunization induced a higher anti-FkH5 IgG titer than that with CCFkH5-VLP (Fig. 1b). Anti-M2 IgG was significantly induced only in the intraperitoneal immunized groups (Fig. 1c), and there was no significant difference between the VLP-protein mixture and each individual VLP-protein (CC and FkH5HA) (Fig. 1d). Anti-FkH5 IgA in nasal wash was detected in intranasal immunization groups that were not induced by intraperitoneal immunization (Fig. 1e and f). Anti-FkH5 IgA was detected with several vaginal wash samples in both intraperitoneal and intranasal immunized groups, however, a significant difference was observed only in the group of intranasal immunization with sesame oil adjuvant (Fig. 1g and h). In this experiment, induction of anti-M2 IgG and anti-FkH5 IgA titers varied significantly among individuals. Fig. 1Induction of IgG and IgA in serum and mucosal samples. Six week-old BALB/c mice were immunized three times a week with CCFkH5-VLP containing 25,000 HA units and 50 ng of IL-12 protein by intraperitoneally (IP), intranasally (IN) or intranasally with sesame oil (SO), or mixture of CC- and FkH5-VLP intraperitoneally. The unvaccinated mouse group was indicated as “unvac”. Each group contains five mice. Serum, nasal wash and vaginal wash were collected one week after the third vaccination, and unvaccinated mice of same age were used as negative controls. Induction of IgG and IgA was evaluated using ELISA. The titer was expressed as relative optical density at 450 nm (OD450). Anti-FkH5 IgG in serum was compared across immunization routes (a) and between CCFkH5-VLP and mixture of CC- and FkH5-VLP (b). Anti-M2 IgG in serum was compared across immunization routes (c) and between CCFkH5-VLP and mixture of CC- and FkH5-VLP (d). Anti-FkH5 IgA in nasal wash was compared across immunization routes (e) and between CCFkH5-VLP and mixture of CC- and FkH5-VLP (f), and that in vaginal wash was compared across immunization routes (g) and between CCFkH5-VLP and mixture of CC- and FkH5-VLP (h). Statistical analysis was performed using pairwise Welch’s test and the p-value was adjusted using the Bonferroni method. The asterisk indicates statistical difference (*: p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01)Full size image Induction of cell immunityTo evaluate the induction of cell immunity by vaccination, IFN-γ secreting cells were measured using the IFN-γ ELISpot assay (Fig. 2). Although no significant results were observed by statistical analysis, IFN-γ secreting cells were induced in some immunized samples (Fig. 2a). These samples showed a confidence interval of greater than 95% in the unvaccinated group. In contrast, of the CC- and FkH5-VLPs combined protein immunized group displayed significant IFN-γ secreting cell induction (Fig. 2b). Fig. 2Detection of IFN-γ secreting cells in splenocytes. Spleen was concurrently collected with serum and mucosal sample collection from unvaccinated and immunized mice. IFN-γ secreting cells were measured with purified splenocytes by the mouse INF-γ ELISpot assay. HKH5 virus was used as the stimulating antigen. IFN-γ secreting cells in splenocytes were compared across immunization routes (a) and between CCFkH5-VLP and mixture of CC- and FkH5-VLP (b). Immunization methods were indicated as unvac: unvaccinated, IP: intraperitoneally, IN: intranasally and IN + SO: intranasally with sesame oil. Each group contains five mice, but IN and IN + SO groups contain four data. Error bars indicate 95% confidential intervals. Statistical analysis was performed using pairwise Welch’s test and the p-value was adjusted using the Bonferroni method, and the asterisk indicates statistical difference (**: p < 0.01)Full size image Comparison of protective activity among immunization methodsThe protective activity of each immunization route and vaccine component was evaluated using PRH1 and HKH5 survival rate for lethal dose and lung plaque titer for AiH3 virus using BALB/c mice (Fig. 3). Although nasal immunization with CCFkH5-VLP did not protect mice from lethal PRH1 virus infection, survival rates improved with CCFkH5-VLP intranasal immunization with sesame oil adjuvant, CCFkH5-VLP intraperitoneal immunization, and CC-VLP + FkH5-VLP intraperitoneal immunization by 40%, 60% and 80%, respectively (Fig. 3a). In all immunization groups, mean body weight of mice was reduced by at least 10% (Fig. 3b). The highest survival rate was observed in the CC + FkH5 IP group, however, three of the four mice that survived had a significantly lower body weight. All immunized groups showed 100% survival rates against lethal HKH5 virus (Fig. 3c). In addition, the mean body weight loss across all immunized groups were less than 10% (Fig. 3d). Lung plaque titers were compared across immunization groups, at four days post AiH3 virus infection, and CCFkH5-VLP intraperitoneal immunization and CCFkH5-VLP with sesame oil by intranasal immunization significantly decreased viral titer (Fig. 3e). There was no significant difference between these two administration methods. Compared to the CCFkH5-VLP immunized group, a significantly lower viral titer was observed in the CC- and FkH5-group (Fig. 3f). Fig. 3Protective activity of the CCFkH5-VLP vaccine against subtypes of influenza A virus. Unvaccinated and immunized mice were lethal challenged with PRH1 and HKH5 viruses one week after administration of the third vaccination. Survival rate and change in body weight were observed for 14 days. (a) Survival rates and (b) change in body weight in PRH1 virus challenge. (c) Survival rate and (d) change in body weight in HKH5 virus challenge. Protective activity against AiH3 virus was evaluated with viral titer in lung at four days post infection (4 dpi). The lung viral titer was compared across (e) immunization routes and (f) vaccine forms. Each group contains five mice and immunization methods were indicated as unvac: unvaccinated, IP: intraperitoneally, IN: intranasally and IN + SO: intranasally with sesame oil. Statistical analysis was performed using pairwise Welch’s test and the p-value was adjusted using the Bonferroni method, and the asterisk indicates statistical difference (*: p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01)Full size image DiscussionIn this study, we evaluated the efficacy of intranasal CCHA-VLP vaccine administration. In addition, we evaluated the efficacy of CC- and HA-VLP. Initially, nasal CCFkH5-VLP immunization conferred a relatively low survival rate in the presence of lethal challenge with PRH1 virus. However, it induced mucosal IgA against the FkH5-VLP antigen compared with intraperitoneal immunization group. It implied that nasal immunization succeeded to induce mucosal immunity. The addition of a sesame oil adjuvant improved the survival rate of the nasal immunized group in the PRH1 virus challenge. Selection of a more appropriate adjuvant may improve CCFkH5-VLP vaccine efficacy via the nasal immunization route.The sesame oil adjuvant group displayed a higher survival rate. Although no significant difference was observed, the sesame oil adjuvant improved vaccine efficacy as indicated by induction of antibodies and IFN-γ secreting cells. However, compared to intraperitoneal immunization, the lower PRH1 virus survival rates were observed in both nasal immunization groups which may be attributed to low anti-M2 IgG in serum. In agreement with this, in this study, it was observed that intranasal immunization induced a lower M2 IgG titer than intraperitoneal immunization. Similar results were observed in a study that compared intranasal and intraperitoneal immunization routes using M2 and HBV core fusion protein, however, higher protective activity against lethal infection was observed in the intranasal immunization [12]. Some mice of CCFkH5 with sesame oil intranasal immunized group showed large weight loss in especially HKH5 virus challenge. It was possibility that these mice were not successfully intranasally administrated with the vaccine because of viscosity of sesame oil, although immunological test was not performed for the challenged mice. As evidence, for example, the standard deviation of serum anti-FkH5-IgG titer which was less affected by sample collection technique than mucosal samples was larger than other immunized groups. Increasing the amount of CC and selecting a more effective adjuvant may improve the induction of anti-M2 IgG and the protective activity against heterotypic influenza virus by intranasal immunization.CC and HA protein was added to the same VLP and its efficacy evaluated. Compared to CCFkH5-VLP immunization, CC- and FkH5-VLP immunization induced a higher quantity of in serum anti-FkH5 IgG and was associated with a higher PRH1 survival rate. However, the induction of anti-M2 IgG and anti-FkH5 IgA in mucosal samples were not significant between these groups. Considering these results, CC and HA protein combination does not provide higher efficacy and therefore it is not necessary to incorporate both proteins into the same VLP in a standardized manner. Instead, this result contributes to increased CC-VLP usability which can be combined with variable HA-VLP altered to match circulating strains. Using high priority subtypes, such as H1 and H3 as included HA, may provide maximum protective activity against homologous subtype and induce broad-based immunity against various serotypes. Since the combination vaccine can be prepared simply, it allows for easy CC/HA and HA subtype proportion alteration.There were several limitations in this study. Firstly, large variety of IgA titers in mucosal samples was probably because of not only success rate of immunization but the disparity in sampling quantity obtained. Consequently, it was difficult to detect statistically significant differences between groups. However, anti-FkH5 IgA was induced in many samples. Second, although the amount of HA protein in vaccines was adjusted using an HA test, protein quantity may have differed by forms of incorporated VLP and mixture of HA- and CC-VLPs, because the number of HA protein contained in a single particle is probably different between CCFkH5-VLP and FkH5-VLP. This may have contributed to the differences in observed vaccine efficacy between CCfkH5-VLP and CC-+FkH5-VLPs immunized groups. Therefore, the incorporated vaccine was not superior, however, it successfully induced humoral and cell immunity comparable to the other vaccines.Our vaccine showed 60–80% survival rate against heterologous H1N1 influenza virus in mice by intraperitoneal immunization. However, published universal influenza vaccine candidates, such as NA targeting vaccine and chimeric protein vaccine which consisted of M2 and HA stalks, showed excellent broad-based immunity against various influenza virus strains [5, 13]. A universal flu vaccine candidate, consisting of chimeric HA protein, underwent a phase I trial and promising results were obtained [14]. Our vaccine does not offer universal influenza vaccine efficacy. Nevertheless, developing vaccines possessing different immunization mechanisms is beneficial to counter measure against virus evolution and immune evasion. In this report, we have tested needle-less vaccination using HA- and CC-VLPs, to improve the usability of our vaccine in development. We plan to advance the chimeric cytokine vaccine to improve efficacy.

(CNN)Here's a look at avian flu.Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, is an illness that usually affects only birds. There are many different strains of avian flu: 16 H subtypes and 9 N subtypes. Only those labeled H5, H7 and H10 have caused deaths in humans.The most commonly seen and most deadly form of the virus is called "Influenza A (H5N1)," or the "H5N1 virus."Diagnosis/TreatmentRead MoreMost cases of human bird flu infections are due to contact with infected poultry or surfaces that are contaminated with infected bird excretions: saliva, nasal secretions or feces. Symptoms of avian flu include fever, cough, sore throat and sometimes severe respiratory diseases and pneumonia. The CDC recommends oral oseltamivir (brand name: Tamiflu), inhaled zanamivir (brand name: Relenza) and intravenous permavir (brand name: Rapivab) for the treatment of human illness associated with avian flu.The mortality rate is close to 60% for infected humans.TimelineEarly 1900s -The avian flu is first identified in Italy.1961 - The H5N1 strain is isolated in birds in South Africa.December 1983 - Chickens in Pennsylvania and Virginia are exposed to the avian flu and more than five million birds are killed to stop the disease from spreading.1997 - Eighteen people are infected by the H5N1 strain in Hong Kong, six die. These are the first documented cases of human infection. Hong Kong destroys its entire poultry population, 1.5 million birds.1999 - Two children in Hong Kong are infected by the H9N2 strain.February 2003 - Eighty-four people in the Netherlands are affected by the H7N7 strain of the virus, one dies. February 7, 2004 - Twelve thousand chickens are killed in Kent County, Delaware, after they are found to be infected with the H7 virus. October 7, 2005 - The avian flu reaches Europe. Romanian officials quarantine a village of about 30 people after three dead ducks there test positive for bird flu.November 12, 2005 - A one-year-old boy in Thailand tests positive for the H5N1 strain of avian influenza. November 16, 2005 - The World Health Organization confirms two human cases of bird flu in China, including a female poultry worker who died from the H5N1 strain. November 17, 2005 - Two deaths are confirmed in Indonesia from the H5N1 strain of avian influenza.January 1, 2006 - A Turkish teenager dies of the H5N1 strain of avian influenza in Istanbul, and later that week, two of his sisters die.

As part of the nationwide surveillance effort for IAVs in fowl in South Korea, we collected environmental fecal samples in different migratory bird stopover sites in South Korea during the winter seasons within November 2014 through January 2018. We collected a total of 6758 fecal samples, 75 of which were positive for IAV (1.11% positivity). Prevalence of IAVs varied per site and per year. Based on sequencing, the most prevalent hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes were H1, H6, and H5, and the most prevalent neuraminidase (NA) subtypes were N1, N3, and N2. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the genes we isolated clustered with reported isolates collected from other locations along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. All the H5 and H7 isolates collected in this study were of low pathogenicity. None of the N1 and N2 genes carried amino acid markers of resistance against NA inhibitors. The winter 2016–2017 subset were primarily borne by migratory geese (Anser spp.). These results suggest that majority of the IAVs circulating among migratory wild fowl in South Korea in 2014–2018 were of low pathogenicity.

Barring the two hemagglutinin (HA; H17 and H18) and two neuraminidase (NA; N10 and N11) subtypes recently discovered in bats, these birds carry all known IAV subtypes (H1–H16 and N1–N9). Wild waterfowl and shorebirds can carry IAV genotypes across flyways, and, to a lesser degree, across oceans2. Open farming allows the sharing of food and water resources between wild and domestic waterfowl that may lead to the transmission of IAVs from wild to domestic birds3. Domestic waterfowl, especially ducks, can then act as intermediate hosts for the transmission of IAVs to poultry, primarily chicken (Galliformes).Certain H5 and H7 IAV strains can cause severe disease in chicken and domestic ducks and are thus called highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs)4. Poultry infected with HPAIVs exhibit severe clinical signs, including paralysis and sudden death, with up to 100% mortality during outbreaks. Because HPAIVs can rapidly spread within a farm and to adjacent farms, HPAIV outbreak control requires culling all birds in affected farms, thereby causing huge economic losses5. The effects of HPAIVs to wild birds are traditionally considered mild. However, reports of HPAIV-related deaths in wild birds have been growing in number, warranting the reassessment of the effects of HPAIVs to wild birds, especially to protected species6,7. HPAIV outbreaks among poultry also expose poultry farm workers to the virus and can cause a range of mild to severe flu symptoms in humans, with approximately 50% case fatality for the H5N1 HPAIV subtype8. Although HPAIVs have not yet caused sustained chains of human-to-human transmission, they are regarded as potential pandemic threats. Meanwhile, low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs) are also known to contribute genetic material to pandemic influenza virus strains and are thus considered precursors of future pandemic influenza viruses9. Genetic material from LPAIVs can also be used to design vaccines for poultry. Therefore, the surveillance of circulating avian influenza viruses, including LPAIVs, is imperative to the understanding of IAV ecology, which impacts both animal and human health.South Korea has experienced HPAIV outbreaks that have been linked to circulating HPAIVs or precursors carried by migratory wild birds10,11,12. In 2008, the government of South Korea implemented a national influenza virus surveillance program to identify IAVs in birds that have the potential to cause HPAIV outbreaks among poultry and may be a threat to humans13. Here, we report the isolation and phylogenetic analyses of avian influenza viruses from fecal matter of wild birds collected in migratory bird stopover sites in South Korea in winters throughout November 2014 to January 2018 as part of the nationwide surveillance program.ResultsPrevalence of avian influenza viruses in South Korea in the winters of 2014 to 2018Samples of fresh bird fecal matter were collected from different sites in South Korea (Fig. 1a) during winters within November 2014 to January 2018. Each winter was defined as November to January of two consecutive years (i.e., November 2014 to January 2015 was defined as the winter of 2014–2015). The sampling sites are known stopover points of migratory birds, especially those coming from Far East Siberia during the annual winter migration along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway (EAAF). As in our previous study that covered winters of 2009 to 201314, the stopover sites were selected for their proximity to previous sites of HPAI outbreaks. A total of 6758 fecal samples were collected throughout the study (Fig. 1a, Table 1). Of these, 75 samples tested positive for IAV through the standard chicken allantoic fluid isolation method and RT-PCR, indicating isolation from 1.11% of the total number of samples for the entire duration of the study. Percent IAV-positivity of samples were highly variable per site and per year (Fig. 1a,b, Table 1), with the winter of 2014–2015 having the highest percent positivity (2.55%), although all the IAV-positive samples that season came from only one of two sampling sites. The winter season with the lowest percent IAV-positivity was 2015–2016 (0.28%), despite a relatively large number of collected samples. Not all sites yielded positive samples, as no IAV was isolated from wild bird fecal matter collected at Gocheonam Reservoir in Jeonnam Province, in contrast with our 2009–2013 study where we reported isolation of IAVs from this site.Figure 1Isolation of influenza A viruses (IAVs) from fecal matter collected at five migratory bird stopover sites in South Korea (winters of November 2014 to January 2018). (a) Fecal samples were collected at five migratory bird stopover sites during the winter seasons from November 2014 to January 2018.

For the study period, the most common HA subtypes were H1 (n = 23; 30.67%), H6 (n = 22; 29.33%), and H5 (n = 14; 18.67%) (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table S1). No virus of the H4, H9, or H10 subtype was identified. However, we were unable to identify the HA subtypes of 3 samples (HX). Different years also had different dominant HA subtypes; the H1 subtype was the most prevalent in 2014–2015, while the H6 subtype was the most prevalent in the succeeding years. The H5 subtype was also among the most prevalent subtypes in most years, except in 2015–2016, when no H5-subtype IAV was isolated.Figure 2Subtypes of influenza A isolates collected in migratory bird stopover sites in South Korea during winter from November 2014 to January 2018. (a) Hemagglutinin (HA), (b) neuraminidase (NA) subtypes, and (c) combinations thereof of all influenza A virus isolates collected over the entire surveillance period. (d) Host species carrying the influenza A virus isolates for winter 2016–2017 were determined through sequencing of the COX1 gene amplified from DNA isolated from the fecal samples.Full size imageFor the duration of the study, the most common NA subtypes were N1 (n = 32; 42.67%), N3 (n = 17; 22.67%), and N2 (n = 12; 16.00%) (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Table S2). No virus belonging to the N6, N10, and N11 subtype was isolated; however, the NA subtype of one sample could not be identified (NX). Isolates belonging to the N1 subtype were the most prevalent in the winters of 2014–2015, 2016–2017, and 2017–2018, whereas isolates of the N2 subtype were the most prevalent during the winter of 2015–2016. The most common subtype combinations were H1N1 (n = 17; 22.67%), H6N1 (n = 13; 17.33%), H5N3 (n = 11; 14.67), and H6N2 (n = 8; 10.67%) (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Table S3). The prevalent subtype combinations varied per year, with H1N1 as the most prevalent subtype in 2014–2015; H6N2 in 2015–2016; and H6N1 in 2016–2017 and 2017–2018.HA and NA sequence identitiesThe HA and NA sequences for the isolates were assembled to generate full and partial coding sequences. These sequences were deposited to GenBank (Supplementary Table S4) and subjected to BLASTn searches in both NCBI and GISAID to identify reported HA and NA isolates that were most similar to our isolates (Supplementary Table S5). As expected, our isolates matched with samples collected from either South Korea or nearby locations (China, Japan, and Mongolia), all of which are part of the EAAF. The closest sequence matches were isolated within similar periods of time (2014–2021). None of the H5 and H7 sequences matched with reported HPAIVs, suggesting that all isolated viruses in this study were LPAIVs. A closer look at the H5 sequences showed the lack of the multibasic HA cleavage site characteristic of HPAIVs (Supplementary Fig. S1a), further indicating that our H5 isolates were LPAI. However, all the H5 isolates carried reported markers for potential mammalian transmission (Supplementary Table S6) as indicated by the “Identify Sequence Features in Segments” tool in the Influenza Research Database. Specifically, majority of the H5 isolates carried the N171, A172, and P251 variations, which were all reported to enhance HA binding to the human ⍺2,6-linked sialic acid15,16. The algorithm did not report notable variations at the 226 amino acid position in the H5 isolates. Meanwhile, the HA amino acid sequences of the two H7 isolates in this study as well as the closely related A/crane/Kor/17 (H7N7) also lacked the multibasic cleavage site, further verifying that they were LPAIVs (Supplementary Fig. S1b).Host species identification for IAVs isolated in the winter of 2016–2017To obtain a snapshot of the host that carried some of our isolates, we extracted genomic DNA from the IAV-positive fecal samples collected during the winter of 2016–2017 (n = 24). The cytochrome C oxidase 1 (COI) gene was amplified from genomic DNA extracted from the fecal matter of the winter 2016–2017 samples, and the sequences of these amplicons were used for identifying the host species using the Barcode of Life Data (BOLD) system. All IAV isolates were carried by members of the genus Anser (wild geese) of the family Anatidae in the order Anseriformes (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Table S7). We were unable to identify the host at the species level for all the samples owing to nearly identical COI sequences among members of the genus Anser. However, the top hits included A. fabalis (bean goose), A. albifrons (greater white-fronted goose), A. anser (greylag goose), and A. cygnoides (swan goose). Both A. fabalis and A. albifrons are among the most common annual visitors to South Korea during winter and are the most probable avian hosts for the isolated IAVs15. We were unable to sequence the COI genes of 7 out of 24 samples owing to the poor quality of DNA extracted from the fecal samples.Phylogenetic analyses of predominant HA subtypesFull and partial sequences of the three most prevalent HA subtypes (H1, H5, H6) were compared with sequences pulled from GenBank and GISAID for phylogenetic analyses (Fig. 3). Our H1 isolates clustered with H1 samples that have been isolated from various locations along the EAAF including South Korea since 2004 (Fig. 3a). This indicates that the current H1 gene pool in South Korea has long been circulating in South Korea and other regions along EAAF. However, a recently reported sequence (2020) from Alaska also clustered with our isolates, indicating that the current EAAF H1 gene pool may have been recently carried over to a different continent by migratory birds either through long-distance migration or through interactions with other migratory bird species from the Pacific flyway.Figure 3Phylogenetic analyses of the three most prevalent hemagglutinin subtypes collected in South Korea during winter from November 2014 to January 2018.

AB aquatic bird, Ck chicken, Dk duck, Gs goose, Md mallard, Kor Korea.Full size imageIn contrast, the H5 and H6 gene pools appear to be more dynamic than that of H1. Our H5 isolates clustered with H5 viruses that have long been circulating since at least 2002 all over Eurasia and Australia, covering all the Eurasian, African, and Australian flyways (Fig. 3b). Meanwhile, our H6 isolates clustered into two major groups: some isolates clustered with H6 samples from North America, while some isolates clustered with H6 samples primarily from Eurasia (Fig. 3c). However, considering that the North American sequences that clustered with our samples were obtained much later (2012 onwards; Fig. 3c, Eurasian Group A) than the earlier Asian samples in the same cluster (2004–2009; Fig. 3c, Eurasian Group A), the North American gene pool in this group may have arisen from the Eurasian gene pool.Phylogenetic analyses of predominant NA subtypesFull and partial sequences of the three most prevalent NA subtypes (N1, N2, and N3) were compared with sequences pulled from GenBank and GISAID for phylogenetic analyses (Fig. 4). The NA genes of our isolates clustered with isolates from the EAAF, and all belong to the Eurasian lineage. Notably, some of our N1 isolates clustered with samples isolated from North America, suggesting that some of the North American N1 gene in circulation have arisen from the Eurasian gene pool. N2 and N3 sequences of viruses isolated in North America also grouped with samples from Eurasia, indicating that Eurasian genes are carried by migratory birds to North America.Figure 4Phylogenetic analyses of the three most prevalent neuraminidase subtypes collected in South Korea during winter from November 2014 to January 2018.

AB aquatic bird, Ck chicken, Dk duck, Gs goose, Md mallard, Kor Korea.Full size imageBecause N1 and N2 subtype influenza viruses are the most associated with human illness and have the potential for reassortment with human influenza virus genes, we determined whether the N1 and N2 subtypes in this study were susceptible to approved NA inhibitors using the “Antiviral Resistance Risk Assessment” tool in the Influenza Research Database. All N1 isolates were found to be susceptible to oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir. Meanwhile, all N2 isolates were found to be susceptible to oseltamivir and zanamivir.DiscussionSimilar to our previous report on avian influenza surveillance from 2009 to 2013 in South Korea14, percent IAV-positivity of bird fecal samples and prevalent IAV subtypes varied per year and per site over the winters of November 2014 to January 2018. All H5 and H7 IAVs isolated during the surveillance period were LPAIVs and were highly similar to isolates obtained from different locations along the EAAF. As expected, most of the HA and NA genes of the isolates clustered with those from isolates obtained from other countries along the EAAF, including China, Japan, and Mongolia. Supporting recent reports that IAVs from wild birds do not always follow rigid flyway boundaries and that there is intercontinental movement of IAV gene pools carried by wild fowl, some of the HA and NA genes of our isolates also cluster with a number of North American isolates. In addition, as shown by the present study and previous results on the surveillance of avian influenza viruses in South Korea14, percent IAV-positivity of samples tends to fluctuate across the years; however, we currently have no specific explanation for this interannual variability.Influenza host species identification using the COI gene amplified from genomic DNA extracted from bird droppings collected during the winter of 2016–2017 indicates that majority of the isolates during the season were carried by migratory geese (Anser spp.). Although we were unable to identify the host at the species level, we speculate that the isolated IAVs came from either the taiga bean goose (A. fabalis) or the greater white-fronted goose (A. albifrons), which are the most dominant goose species that winter in South Korea from breeding sites in Far East Siberia17. IAVs, including HPAIVs, have been previously isolated from these goose species in other studies in South Korea13,18,19; migratory geese are therefore presumed to contribute to HPAIV outbreaks in the country.Similar to our surveillance study in previous years, IAVs of the H6 subtype were among the most frequently isolated during successive winters in South Korea. This is corroborated by studies that suggest that H6-subtype IAVs are the most frequently isolated subtypes from wild waterfowl especially in Asia20. A study from China reported that 11.07% of the isolates from wild birds in 2016–2017 were of the H6 subtype, making H6 the most predominant subtype in that study21. In our study, IAVs of the H6 subtype were likewise the most prevalent over the winter of 2016–2017, which may indicate similar distributions of IAV subtypes along the EAAF that year. Another study has reported that 49.44% (44/89) of isolates from wild birds in China along the EAAF over 2015–2019 were of the H6 subtype22. In our study, the H6-subtype IAVs were consistently isolated in all four years, suggesting its persistence in migratory waterfowl populations that traverse the EAAF. Recent studies from China suggest that H6NX viruses from wild birds, including A/Anser fabalis/China/Anhui/L221/2014 (H6N1), which is 99% identical to one of our isolates (A/Kor/CN69/2014 [H6N2]), can infect mice and replicate at high titers in mouse lungs without prior adaptation23. While H6-subtype IAVs are considered LPAI and are non-reportable, they may still cause damage to the poultry industry (~ 30% drop in egg production)20. Given the potential ability of H6-subtype IAVs to infect mammals, their persistence in the wild, and their effects on poultry, closer investigation of H6-subtype IAVs is warranted.Meanwhile, in our study, viruses of the H1 subtype were predominant in the winter of 2014–2015, accounting for 50% (18/36) of the isolates that season. This is in line with a previous report of an H1NX outbreak among wild fowl in Anhui, China24 and from another study in bird wintering wetlands in Yangtze River, China25.Despite H5 HPAI outbreaks in poultry in South Korea over the study period, we found no H5 HPAIV during our surveillance. However, H5-subtype LPAIVs, especially H5N3 LPAIVs, were among the most prevalent subtypes, particularly in the winters of 2014–2015 (27%) and 2016–2017 (12.5%). Another surveillance study in South Korea also reported the prevalence of H5 LPAIVs from wild bird habitats in 2015 (13.1%) and 2017 (14.4%), coinciding with our results26. In contrast to our findings, this previous study reported the isolation of H5-subtype LPAIVs in 2017 in the Jeonnam Province of South Korea, while we obtained no isolate from Gocheonam Reservoir in Jeonnam Province. However, the Jeonnam isolates of this study were obtained in December 2017, while we performed sampling in the same region in November 2016. The differences in isolation rates of H5 and other AIV isolates in this province may be due to sampling bias, as we only sampled a very small portion of a large migratory bird stopover site, and only performed sampling on a single day in a single winter season. Obtaining more avian fecal samples later in the season and on other years may have yielded different results.All our H5 isolates carried markers of increased transmission to mammals. These markers include the N171and T172 variations which, when present together, have been reported to increase binding of the A/Viet Nam/1203/2004 (H5N1) HA to the human ⍺2,6-linked sialic acid without loss of binding to the avian ⍺2,3-linked sialic acid15. Another variation found in most of our isolates was P251, which has been reported to slightly increase the binding of the A/duck/Egypt/D1Br12/2007 (H5N1) HA binding to ⍺2,6-linked sialic acid16. The L226 variation was not present in any of our H5 isolates. These findings suggest that H5 genotypes circulating in wild birds passing through South Korea and adjacent countries continue to gain potential to infect mammals. The persistence of these H5 sequences in the wild increases their chances of reassortment with other IAV genes that may lead to eventual crossing to the mammalian species barrier and perhaps to sustained transmission among mammals including humans. Considering that H5 LPAIVs have been reported as precursors of HPAIVs, continued monitoring of H5 LPAIVs is needed to guide mitigation and control measures for H5 IAV infections in both wild and domestic fowl.Only 2 fecal samples (2.6% of total) yielded H7-subtype isolates, both of which were H7N7 LPAIVs. Interestingly, both the HA and NA genes of the isolates were highly identical to those of an H7N7 isolate from a red-crowned crane (Aed-crowned crane/Korea/H1026/2017) in a zoo in South Korea isolated in March 201727. Our H7N7 samples were collected in January 2017, placing this particular H7N7 gene pool in South Korea earlier than closely related H7N7 isolates collected from migratory mallards in February to March of 2017. Notably, H7 isolation was more frequent in the other study (43.6% of all isolates in early 2017) than in ours (8.3%), possibly owing to differences in sample timing, host species, and sampling method28. Regardless, transmission of H7 IAVs from migratory fowl to other bird species was highlighted by the isolation of the H7N7 isolate in the captive crane, which further emphasizes the likelihood of transmission of H7 IAVs from migratory wild birds to domestic birds.As in previous years of our study, the IAV isolation rate was variable per year. This may be a result of changes in seasonal temperatures across different years. Migration of fowl, including bean geese and white-fronted geese, is highly affected by temperatures. The timing of bird migration to wintering sites may change based on temperatures in both the breeding and wintering sites29. This would then affect the composition of migratory fowl populations at stopover sites and, in turn, affect observed IAV prevalence. Environmental temperatures also affect the persistence of IAVs in aquatic environments and may affect the maintenance of IAVs in wild birds30; changes in temperatures across the years would then alter the prevalence of IAV infection in wild birds. Thus, the timing of IAV surveillance studies such as this should take into account potential variabilities in environmental temperatures and timing of bird migration to be able to obtain a more comprehensive view of IAV prevalence in breeding, stopover, or wintering sites.One limitation of our study is that, at the time of writing, the sequences we report are already at least five years old. Several studies have already reported more recent data (2019 to 2022) on circulating avian influenza viruses among wildfowl that visit South Korea, although most have focused on H5-, H7-, and H9-subtype influenza viruses19,31,32,33. Given the continued threat of AIVs to both animal and human health, large amounts of genetic data are important to allow us to track the movement of avian influenza virus gene pools across time and geographic locations. Ensuring that sequences of influenza viruses over large periods of time are reported will fill in potential gaps of information in tracing back the evolution of future avian-origin influenza virus pandemics. This has been highlighted by the recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, where, owing to very few surveillance studies in the past and very little existing genetic information on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related viruses prior to the pandemic, scientists have difficulty in fully understanding the emergence of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Global public health will undoubtedly benefit from all available genetic information on AIVs especially within the past couple of decades, as these would be the first resources to investigate should an avian-origin pandemic arise. It would also allow us to further understand the dynamics of the continued spread and circulation of avian influenza viruses in the wild in the hope of preparing for large outbreaks in both wild and domestic birds.Additionally, most AIV surveillance studies in South Korea focus on H5-, H7-, and H9-subtype influenza viruses. While these subtypes pose the highest and most immediate risk to veterinary and human health, other subtypes of AIVs may contribute genetic material to future threats, and, in rare cases, cause disease and death in humans34. Thus, we believe that long-term surveillance studies on IAVs that include LPAIVs and HPAIVs and the reportable and non-reportable subtypes can provide the scientific community a wealth of genetic information that can be utilized when the need arises.All in all, in this study, we were able to collect a total of 6758 bird fecal samples from five migratory bird stopover sites in South Korea during the winters of 2014 to 2018 (November 2014 to January 2018). Of these, 75 (1.11%) tested positive for IAVs based on egg isolation and RT-PCR. The most common HA subtypes were H1, H6, and H5, and the most common NA subtypes were N1, N3, and N2. Based on sequence analysis, all isolates, including the H5- and H7-subtypes, were LPAIVs and were most similar to isolates collected along the EAAF. As in previous years, isolation rates and predominant subtypes varied per site and per year. Although we were unable to isolate HPAIVs from the bird fecal samples despite HPAIVs outbreaks in South Korea during the study period, this surveillance study provides insight into the dynamics of IAVs carried by migratory birds into South Korea.MethodsSample collection and virus isolationThrough the winter seasons of 2014 to 2018 (November 2014 to January 2018), a total of 6758 fecal samples were collected from stopover sites of wild migratory birds in South Korea. Fecal samples were stored in transport medium consisting of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and glycerol (50%) with antibiotics (1000 U/ml penicillin G and polymyxin B, 500 U/ml nystatin, 250 µg/ml gentamicin, 60 µg/ml ofloxacin, and 200 µg/ml sulfamethoxazole) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The collected samples were stored at − 80 °C until analysis or egg passage.The samples were suspended in antibiotic-supplemented PBS and inoculated into the allantoic cavity of 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs35. The allantoic fluid was collected; turbid fluid was assumed to be contaminated with bacteria or fungi and was discarded. All viral isolates were collected from the first egg passage. Viral presence was identified through the hemagglutination assay using 0.5% chicken red blood cells.RT-PCR and sequence analysisViral gene amplification using samples that tested positive in the hemagglutination assay was performed as previously described30. Using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), viral RNA was extracted from the hemagglutination-positive allantoic fluid. For HA and NA gene subtyping, one-step RT-PCR was carried out using the One Step RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) with HA- or NA-specific universal primer sets designed and described in a previous study36. The RT-PCR reactions were set up according to manufacturer instructions. Each 50-μl reaction contained 1.5 μl of each primer (20 pmol/μl) and 2 μl of viral RNA (1 pg–2 µg). Reverse transcription was performed at 50 °C for 30 min, and standard PCR was performed with an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 10 min; followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min; and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. After purification with the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen), the amplified gene segments were commercially sequenced at Cosmogenetech Co. (Seoul, South Korea). Sequencing was based on the Sanger sequencing technology using the high-throughput DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA Analyzer, Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Full-length coding sequences (HA: 1710 bp; NA: 1410 bp) were assembled using the Lasergene sequence analysis software package (DNASTAR, Madison, WI). A BLASTn query was performed in NCBI to identify the HA and NA subtypes of the isolates based on the obtained sequences and to identify isolates reported in GenBank that had the highest HA and NA coding sequence similarities to our isolates. The search results were supplemented with a BLAST analysis in GISAID especially for sequences that had hits with < 99% sequence identity on GenBank. Full and partial HA and NA sequences of the isolates were deposited to GenBank, and accession numbers are listed in Supplementary Table S1.Host identification using the COI geneGenomic DNA was extracted from wild bird fecal droppings collected in winter 2016–2017 using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The COI gene was isolated thru PCR amplification using bird-specific COI primers: forward primer: 5′-TTCTCCAACCACAAAGACATTGGCAC-3′, and reverse primer: 5′-ACGTGGGAGATAATTCCAAATCCTG-3′37, followed by purification using a QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen). The amplified COI genes were commercially sequenced (Cosmogenetech), and the full sequences of the COI genes were assembled using the Lasergene analysis software. The host species were determined using the web version of BOLD SYSTEMS Identification Engine (https://www.boldsystems.org/index.php/IDS_OpenIdEngine), which is widely used for species-level identification38. The “All Barcode Records on BOLD” was selected as the search database, and the hits were determined based on % similarity with the assembled COI genes of the samples.Sequence alignment to determine sequence motifsThe H5 and H7 nucleotide sequences of the isolates were translated into amino acid sequences using the EMBOSS Transeq translation tool (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/st/emboss_transeq/). The amino acid sequences were aligned with sequences of reported HPAI H5 and H7 isolates using UGENE to determine whether the HA of the isolates had monobasic or multibasic cleavage sites.Phylogenetic analyses of HA and NA coding sequencesThe assembled full and partial coding sequences of H1, H5, H6, N1, N2, and N3 isolates were aligned using CLUSTAL V39. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were prepared through the web version of PhyML (1,000 transfer bootstrap replicates; http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/)40. The trees were rooted using the NJ Plot software41 and visualized using Interactive Tree of Live (iTOL; https://itol.embl.de/)42.Identification of HA and NA sequence featuresTo assess whether the H5 sequences carried markers for mammalian infection, we submitted the nucleotide coding sequences of the H5 isolates to the “Identify Sequence Features in Segments” analysis tool in the Influenza Research Database (https://legacy.fludb.org). Amino acid features with hits are listed for the H5 isolates.To determine whether our N1 and N2 isolates are susceptible to approved influenza NA inhibitors, we first obtained the amino acid sequences of the N1 and N2 isolates using the EMBOSS Transeq translation tool. The amino acid sequences were then submitted to the “Antiviral Resistance Risk Assessment” analysis tool of the Influenza Research Database.

The South American nation, the world’s biggest chicken meat exporter with $9.7bn in sales last year, has confirmed at least eight cases of the H5N1 virus in wild birds, including one in Rio de Janeiro state and seven in the neighbouring state of Espirito Santo. Infection by the H5N1 subtype of avian flu in wild birds does not trigger trade bans, based on guidelines of the World Organization for Animal Health. However, a case of bird flu on a farm usually results in the entire flock being killed and can trigger trade restrictions from importing countries. The country’s agriculture ministry said later on Monday it has created an emergency operations centre to coordinate, plan and evaluate “national actions related to avian influenza”. While Brazil’s main meat-producing states are in the south, the government is on alert after the confirmed cases, as avian flu in wild birds has been followed by transmission to commercial flocks in some countries. Shares in Brazil-based BRF SA, the world’s biggest chicken exporter, were up 3.6 percent before the government announcement and ended the day 0.5 percent lower. Over the weekend, the Health Ministry said samples of 33 suspected cases of avian influenza in humans in Espirito Santo, where Brazil confirmed the first cases in wild birds last week, came back negative for the H5N1 subtype. Last year, five human bird flu cases were reported. However, past human cases of H5N1 avian influenza have had a 53 percent mortality, according to the World Health Organization. In April, the WHO said a 56-year-old woman in southern China died after testing positive for the avian influenza subtype H3N8, marking the first human death from that strain of bird flu. The H3N8 virus is known to have been circulating since 2002 and is considered less dangerous for both domestic poultry and wild birds than H5N1.

This keeps scientists constantly wrangled up in a game of chess, trying to update their drugs and vaccines.A famous example of this comes from a recent wound: COVID-19. As researchers developed vaccines for initial strains of the virus, the virus kept mutating into the fearsome Omicron, Delta and a plethora of other variants, spawning one wave after another in its warpath.However, a group of Indian scientists might just have developed the final nail in the COVID-19 coffin. The group of researchers have created a new class of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs — called diphenylurea derivatives, or DPUDS — that seems to have proven highly effective at not just tackling COVID-19 and influenza, but also in stopping emerging future variants in their tracks."We have altogether identified five DPUDs that are capable of blocking both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus by 95-100 per cent," Indranil Banerjee, one of the lead scientists from the Indian Institute of Science, told Deccan Herald.These drug candidates have been shown to completely block the concerning Wuhan, Delta and Omicron (among other) strains, as well as the H1N1 and H3N2 influenza strains. Furthermore, it navigates the shelf life problem very nicely by overcoming the ability of microbes to begin resisting the drug — a grave concern for current gen antivirals."We have found that DPUDs don't induce any resistance in the virus," notes Prabal Banerjee, another study researcher. "We compared the FDA-approved anti-influenza drug Tamiflu with DPUDs to check the induction of resistance in influenza virus. While Tamiflu became ineffective after some time, DPUDs didn't induce any resistance and remained effective even after prolonged exposure to influenza virus," he explains. AdvertisementThey work and remain this effective by barring the very entry of the pathogens, acting like big, scary bouncers stopping them from entering the tantalising party raging inside your body. This eliminates the viral life cycle at the first step itself, preventing the infection from progressing in its tracks.In addition, they don't induce any apparent toxicity either, meaning the host might have close to zero side effects. Mice trials showed remarkable body weight recovery, improved survival chances and a notable reduction in lung viral load. While half of the COVID-infected mice died, all under the DPUD treatment survived.However, some authors note that more study is necessary due to how these drugs work by changing the chloride balance inside cells."It is well worth remembering that chloride ions play an important role in controlling the function of neurons in the central nervous system. Its dysregulation leads to seizures and is associated with conditions like schizophrenia, Down's Syndrome, Autism and others," notes Jameel from the University of Oxford."That these symptoms were not observed in mice is encouraging, but mice and humans are different. This requires more study," he stresses.The findings of this study have been published in PLOS Pathogens and can be accessed here.**For weather, science, space, and COVID-19 updates on the go, download The Weather Channel App (on Android and iOS store).

Coluccia Gaia Dossi Mara Squicciarini May 24th, 2023 The 1918 flu pandemic made some people more religious, and others, more innovative. 0 comments Estimated reading time: 10 minutes What does adversity mean for people’s religious beliefs and for scientific progress? Enrico Berkes, Davide Coluccia, Gaia Dossi and Mara Squicciarini investigate whether a destructive event – such as a pandemic – leads to either an increase in religiosity or a boost in innovation efforts. They find that both reactions can occur at the same time, and that people in countries more affected by the 1918 flu pandemic become both more religious and more innovative. Adverse events such as natural disasters and pandemics have always posed challenges to societies worldwide and continue to do so today. The recent COVID-19 pandemic, for example, has claimed almost seven million lives worldwide. Understanding how individuals cope with adverse events has key social, economic, and political implications, and it is crucial in designing effective policies in their aftermath. There is evidence that shows how adverse events can make people more likely to be more religious. Separate research finds an increase in innovation efforts to mitigate the negative impact of, for example, environmental catastrophes. Can societies therefore become simultaneously more religious and more innovative? This would be surprising because religiosity and science are two phenomena that are typically in contrast with each other, both historically and today. In new research, we address this question by studying the reaction of religion and science to a catastrophic historical event: the 1918 Influenza Pandemic in the United States. The pandemic (also known as “Spanish Flu”) was one of the most lethal in modern history, killing around 0.7 percent of the US population in two years, a mortality rate more than twice as high as that of COVID-19. Historical records document that many people turned to or strengthened their religious faith in response to the 1918 pandemic. At the same time, the period that followed saw an increase in innovative activity and important medical advances. Despite being largely ineffective during the pandemic, medicine evolved enormously in subsequent years. By the 1930s, virology had become an established field in medicine and the development of the first influenza vaccines began. Using baby names to measure religiosity following the 1918 Influenza Pandemic To conduct our analysis, we developed a novel measure of religiosity based on how babies were named between 1900 and 1930 from historical full-count censuses. The key advantage of this approach is that it allows us to measure religiosity at a granular spatial level and yearly frequency. The underlying idea is that the first name given to a child conveys information on the religiosity of their parents. For example, with our approach we find that names associated with popular saints or biblical episodes such as “Esther” and “Paul” are associated with high religiosity. We then aggregate the measure at the county level. To measure scientific progress, we use the number of patents produced in a certain county, as well as the share of individuals in scientific occupations. Historical and modern accounts suggest that the pandemic hit the US in a near-random fashion. In the data we find support for this claim, and we further document that counties differentially hit by the Influenza pandemic were similar in terms of their religiosity, their production of innovation, and the share of individuals in scientific occupations before the pandemic. Our results suggest that counties hit harder by the shock experienced an increase in religiosity. We also find that these same counties experienced an increase in innovative activities, and more specifically concentrated in pharmaceutical patents. In addition, we find that employment in scientific occupations grew in counties hit harder by the pandemic. Cities display a similar pattern: those which experienced higher excess deaths due to the pandemic became both more religious and more innovative. Photo by Julia Koblitz on Unsplash The 1918 pandemic made some people more religious and others, more innovative. Did the same individuals become both more religious and more innovative after the pandemic or did different individuals react in different ways? We find evidence that the second mechanism is at play. Individuals from more religious backgrounds further embraced religion, while those from less religious backgrounds became more likely to choose a scientific occupation. These results suggest that, within counties, a group of individuals turned to religion as a coping device, while a separate group turned to science. Our findings on religiosity are in line with two possible explanations. On the one hand, religious faith can provide a coping device to deal with personal distress following a negative shock (in the psychology literature, this is known as the “religious coping hypothesis”). On the other hand, individuals may turn to religion as a source of social insurance. While we are not able to fully distinguish between the two mechanisms, we interpret our evidence as being in favour of the religious coping hypothesis for two reasons. First, this interpretation of the results is in line with the literature showing that intrinsic religiosity—rather than churchgoing—responds to unexpected negative events. Second, the increase in religiosity persists for up to a decade after the shock, suggesting a change in behavior rather than a temporary need for social insurance. What motivates people to turn to science is less obvious. Individuals may turn to science to deal with their psychological distress—similarly to religious coping—or to actively mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic. In support of this interpretation, we find that the increase in innovation is driven by individual inventors (the so-called “garage inventors”), rather than inventors within a firm or an organization. Additionally, we find that those turning to science are mostly young individuals, who experienced the pandemic in their late teens and early twenties. According to theories in psychology, these are the “impressionable years” when individuals form their preferences. Another possibility is that individuals turn to science because of increased labour demand in scientific occupations in counties more hit by the pandemic. While we cannot rule this out, our results suggest that, beyond market forces, the individual’s religious background (or, more precisely, the lack thereof) plays a key role in the decision to turn to science. Despite the differences between the present context and the Influenza pandemic, including medical advancements over the past century, our research suggests that the response of modern society to COVID-19 (an increase in religiosity and innovation) is like that observed in 1918-1919. Our findings can help explain the opposing views that have emerged since the COVID-19 pandemic on science-based responses to the shock, such as the polarized attitudes toward vaccines.

France has developed vaccines against the viral disease for ducks, which may provide respite. Two vaccines tested in France against avian flu have proven to be “very effective” in protecting mule ducks from the virus, the French health agency Anses told news agency AFP on May 25, 2023 paving the way for a national vaccination within a few months.

According to the United States’ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the influenza is a disease in birds caused by infection with avian (bird) influenza (flu) Type A viruses, also called H5N1. They can be highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) or low pathogenicity avian influenza. The French ministry of agriculture and food sovereignty started trials in May 2022 to test vaccines on mule ducks to protect against HPAI. The study was conducted in two phases, the ministry said on its website. Read more: H5 pandemic in the making?

The following results were reported from sentinel laboratories across Canada in week 20 (Figures 2 and 3): A total of 345 laboratory detections (213 influenza B and 132 influenza A) were reported. Influenza B detections (62%) are predominant. Among subtyped influenza A detections (27), all were influenza A(H1N1). Among detections for which age information was reported (255), 207(81%) of detections were in individuals under the age of 65 years. To date this season (August 28, 2022 to May 20, 2023): 71,218 influenza detections were reported, of which 93% (66,544) were influenza A and among subtyped influenza A detections (20,752), influenza A(H3N2) accounted for 91% of detections. 51,751 laboratory-confirmed influenza detections with age information were reported, of which 21,143 (41%) were in individuals aged 0-19 years old (Figure 4).

Changes in laboratory testing practices may affect the comparability of data to previous seasons. Due to different testing protocols of laboratories across Canada, some influenza A subtype detection counts may not be included in total influenza A detection counts and percent positivity calculations. Figure 4 - Text description a) Proportion of influenza A and B by age-group Age Group Proportion of Influenza A Proportion of Influenza B Total Number Influenza Detections 0 to 4 92.5% 7.5% 9215 5 to 19 91.1% 8.9% 11928 20 to 44 89.3% 10.7% 10917 45 to 64 95.8% 4.2% 6743 65+ 98.7% 1.3% 12948 b) Proportion of subtyped influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) by age-group Age Group Proportion of A(H1N1) Proportion of A(H3N2) Total Number of Subtyped Influenza Detections 0 to 4 5.8% 94.2% 2854 5 to 19 4.8% 95.2% 3580 20 to 44 9.7% 90.3% 2905 45 to 64 17.7% 82.3% 1883 65+ 10.1% 89.9% 3644 Syndromic / Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Healthcare Practitioners Sentinel Surveillance In week 20, 0.2% of visits to healthcare professionals were due to influenza-like illness (ILI) (Figure 5). The percentage of visits for ILI is below expected levels for this time of year. ILI symptoms are not specific to any one respiratory pathogen and can be due to influenza, or other respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus and SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. This makes the percentage of visits for ILI an important indicator of overall respiratory illness morbidity in the community in the presence of co-circulating viruses. This indicator should be interpreted with caution as there have been changes in healthcare seeking behavior of individuals and a smaller number of sentinels reporting compared to previous seasons. Figure 5 – Percentage of visits for ILI reported by sentinels by report week, Canada, weeks 2022-35 to 2023-20 Number of Sentinels Reporting in Week 20: 33 The shaded area represents the maximum and minimum percentage of visits for ILI reported by week from seasons 2014-2015 to 2019-2020. Data from week 11 of the 2019-2020 season onwards are excluded from the historical comparison due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The percentage of FluWatchers who have reported cough and fever is below seasonal levels. The reports of cough and fever are not specific to any one respiratory pathogen and can be due to influenza, or other respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, and SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. This makes the proportion of individuals reporting cough and fever an important indicator of overall respiratory illness activity in the community in the presence of co-circulating viruses. FluWatchers reporting is not impacted by changes in health services or health seeking behaviours. Among the 93 participants who reported cough and fever: 25% consulted a healthcare professional. 67% reported days missed from work or school, resulting in an average of 2.5 missed days from work or school among those 62 participants. The Northwest Territories had the highest participation rate this week (51 participants per 100,000 population) and the neighbourhood with postal code, K0A had the highest number of participants (120).

Genetic Characterization of Influenza A(H3N2) Five influenza A(H3N2) viruses did not grow to sufficient hemagglutination titers for antigenic characterization by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays. Therefore, NML has performed genetic characterization to determine the genetic group identity of these viruses. Sequence analysis of the HA genes of the viruses showed that they belonged to genetic group 3C.2a1b.2a2. A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3N2)-like virus is an influenza A/H3N2 component of the 2022-23 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine and belongs to genetic group 3C.2a1b.2a2. Antigenic Characterization Influenza A(H3N2) Of the 395 influenza A (H3N2) viruses characterized, 389 were characterized as antigenically similar to A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3N2)-like virus with antisera raised against cell-grown A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3N2)-like virus. Six viruses showed reduced titer with antisera raised against cell-grown A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3N2)-like virus. A/Darwin/6/2021 (H3N2)-like virus is an influenza A/H3N2 component of the 2022-23 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine. The 395 influenza A(H3N2) viruses characterized belonged to genetic group 3C.2a1b.2a2. Influenza A(H1N1) 56 influenza A (H1N1) viruses were characterized as antigenically similar to A/Wisconsin/588/2019-like with ferret antisera produced against cell-propagated A/Wisconsin/588/2019. A/Wisconsin/588/2019 is the influenza A/H1N1 component of the 2022-23 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine. Influenza B 55 viruses characterized were antigenically similar to B/Austria/1359417/2021. Influenza B viruses can be divided into two antigenically distinct lineages represented by B/Yamagata/16/88 and B/Victoria/2/87 viruses. The recommended influenza B components for the 2022-23 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine are B/Austria/1359417/2021 (Victoria lineage) and B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Yamagata lineage). Antiviral Resistance The NML also tests influenza viruses received from Canadian laboratories for antiviral resistance. Oseltamivir 476 influenza viruses (374 A(H3N2), 56 A(H1N1) and 46 influenza B) were tested for resistance to oseltamivir and it was found that: All influenza viruses were sensitive to oseltamivir. Zanamivir 476 influenza viruses (365 A(H3N2), 43 A(H1N1) and 26 influenza B) were tested for resistance to zanamivir and it was found that: All influenza viruses were sensitive to zanamivir. Influenza Vaccine Monitoring Vaccine monitoring refers to activities related to the monitoring of influenza vaccination coverage and vaccine effectiveness. Vaccination Coverage The Seasonal Influenza Immunization Vaccination Coverage Survey is an annual telephone survey conducted between January and February that collects information from Canadians on whether they received the annual seasonal influenza vaccine that season. Vaccination coverage is measured as the percentage of people who reported receiving the influenza vaccine in a specific influenza season. In the 2022-2023 influenza season, coverage was slightly higher compared to the 2021-2022 season at: 44% among all adults aged 18 years and older. 31% among adults aged 18-64 without chronic medical conditions. 43% among adults aged 18-64 with chronic medical conditions. 74% among seniors (aged 65 years and older). Table 1 – Seasonal influenza vaccination coverage, by risk group and influenza season, Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Coverage Survey, Canada, 2020-2021 to 2022-2023 Flu Season 2022-2023 2021-2022 2020-2021 Age group (years) n Vaccination coverage % (95% CI) n Vaccination coverage % (95% CI) n Vaccination coverage % (95% CI) All adults (≥18) 3535 43.5 (41.6-45.3) 3487 38.7 (36.9-40.6) 3014 40.4 (38.4-42.4) 18-64, without chronic medical condition 1715 31.0 (28.6-33.4) 1658 26.8 (24.4-29.2) 1498 29.2 (26.6-31.8) 18-64, with chronic medical condition 583 43.1 (38.6-47.6) 713 37.6 (33.6-41.7) 646 40.5 (36.2-44.8) Seniors (≥65) 1198 73.7 (71.0-76.5) 1098 71.0 (68.1-74.0) 862 70.4 (67.1-73.8) Vaccine Effectiveness The Canadian Sentinel Practitioner Surveillance Network (SPSN) provides estimates of the effectiveness of the seasonal influenza vaccine in preventing medically-attended illness due to laboratory-confirmed influenza among Canadians. Based on data collected between November 1, 2022 and January 6, 2023, vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated to be 54% against influenza A(H3N2). Due to the dominant circulation of influenza A(H3N2) this season, the VE estimate was only available for one influenza subtype. By age group, VE was 47% (95% CI 11 to 69) for individuals under the age of 19 years, 58% (95% CI 33 to 73) for adults aged 20-64 years and 59% (95% CI 15 to 80) for adults 65 years and older. The SPSN interim estimates are published and available online. Updated influenza VE estimates, if available, will be published at the end of the 2022-2023 influenza season.

Furthermore, technicians can also test the sample together, not separately.By CNBCTV18.com May 26, 2023, 4:21:34 PM IST (Updated)3 Min ReadPune-based National Institute of Virology (NIV) has developed India's first indigenous testing kit capable of detecting three infections in a single kit: COVID-19 and two versions of influenza-A and influenza-B. NIV is now looking for companies to manufacture these kits in bulk and has set a deadline of June 15 for those interested to submit their proposals. Similar to the regular COVID-19 testing kits, the NIV's "multiplex single tube real-time RT-PCR test," as the Hindustan Times reports, uses a nasal and throat swab of patients. It can detect both the flu and COVID-19. Since the symptoms of Influenza A, Influenza B and SARS-CoV-2 infection are similar, this test kit is useful, especially during flu seasons. While Influenza-A is a seasonal flu that spreads more commonly, especially among adults, Influenza B infects children mostly. The former is prevalent in animals and birds and can transfer to humans but the latter is found only in humans. Symptoms of both are similar, nasal congestion, cough, headache and body aches, chills, sore throat, fever, vomiting and diarrhoea and fatigue. Serious cases could result in chest pain, severe dizziness, loss of consciousness, etc. ALSO READ | China braces for new Covid wave with up to 65 million weekly cases Dr Varsha Potdar, speaking to HT, said that the kit will be "an easy, time-saving and efficient way of detecting three infections through a single test." Being a single-tube test, people using it will only have to provide one sample to diagnose multiple infections. Furthermore, technicians can also test the sample together, not separately. According to HT, "Multiplex testing in molecular tests refers to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests that simultaneously detect multiple pathogens in a single reaction with a single sample."

After the June 14 deadline, the NIV will choose a licensee or manufacturer to hand over the technology. Potdar said that based on the applications they receive, the organisation will evaluate its best candidate. CNBC in February 2023 reported that the US Food and Drug Administration had approved the first combination home test for the flu and COVID-19. ALSO READ | COVID or the common cold?

The facility will use innovative technology to produce seasonal and pandemic cell-based influenza vaccines, CSL Seqirus’ vaccine adjuvant technology (MF59), the world’s only approved human vaccine for Q fever and antivenoms for venomous creatures native to Australia. The site in Tullamarine, Melbourne, will have a gross floor area of 28,400m2 across three key buildings. Topping out has been marked by the completion of roof laying on these buildings, which will be used for seasonal and pandemic cell-based influenza vaccine manufacturing, antivenoms and Q-Fever vaccine manufacturing and administration and laboratories. It is on schedule to be operational in 2026 and will support Australia’s preparedness and responsiveness in a future pandemic crisis. Jonah Smith, Vice President and Program Lead for the CSL Seqirus Tullamarine Manufacturing Facility, said: “This will be the only cell-based influenza vaccine manufacturing facility in the Southern Hemisphere and will provide access to Australian-made innovative vaccines and potentially lifesaving antivenoms. “This facility will manufacture influenza vaccines for use in Australia and overseas, creating a supply chain worth more than $300 million annually to the Australian economy.” In the site CSL is incorporating on-site renewable energy generation, electrifying the plant to reduce the reliance on fossil fuels, conducting heat and water recovery. This is also one of the first local manufacturing facilities to pursue 5 star ‘Green Star’ and Gold WELL certification. Smith said: “The new site will also feature a digitally connected manufacturing environment, deploying advanced analytics that will drive innovation and optimise our manufacturing operations. “This includes a fully automated and paperless manufacturing execution system that will support our highly skilled workforce to optimise production, improve quality control and reduce downtime.” Jonathan Anderson, CSL Seqirus Executive Medical Director – International Regions, said cell-based vaccines were a significant innovation in influenza vaccine manufacturing as they address several limitations associated with traditional technologies. Anderson said: “By making vaccines in cells, we can eliminate the introduction of egg-based mutations that can impact influenza vaccines. “We’re seeing influenza return to pre-COVID levels and we’ve experienced early flu seasons in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres recently. “Reducing the burden of influenza is a key focus for public health strategies and meeting demand for vaccines is an important aspect of those strategies.” Over 200 million doses of cell-based influenza vaccines have been distributed worldwide by CSL Seqirus, with demand doubling in the Past two years. Australia will soon be a major contributor in meeting this demand. “In the event of an influenza pandemic, this facility would quickly switch to manufacturing strain-matched cell-based pandemic influenza vaccines. “Cell-based technology offers scale and production time advantages over the traditional influenza vaccine manufacturing process, an important consideration for pandemic preparedness.” Picture: CSL/Hamish Walsh/site progress Subscribe to newsletter Back to homepage Topics CSL Manufacturing News Share this Story Manufacturing News 22 May 2023 01:28 By Peter Roberts Share this story More in this section Manufacturing News 12 Nov 2024 Recycled carpet in concrete boosts strength, reduces cracking Staff Reporter Manufacturing News 12 Nov 2024 A look at climate reporting obligations for manufacturers Staff Reporter Manufacturing News 12 Nov 2024 EMVision scanner device successfully identifies stroke Staff Reporter Manufacturing News 12 Nov 2024 Nourish says Cabio partnership links “Australian innovation with China’s manufacturing might” Staff Reporter @aumanufacturing Sections Analysis and Commentary Awards Defence Manufacturing News Podcast Technology Videos Stay Informed Join the conversation at the Australian Manufacturing Forum, the nation’s largest online discussion group for manufacturers.
