It also provided the animals protection against death from flu strains not included in the vaccine, showing its potential to help prevent future flu pandemics. Influenza virus particles isolated from a patient sample and propagated in cell culture. John Gallagher and Audray Harris, NIAID Laboratory of Infectious Diseases Influenza, the virus that causes the flu, can be deadly. Twenty different types of the virus have been identified. Many of these circulate between animals and people. This, along with the seasonal virus’s frequent mutations, makes developing effective flu vaccines with broad protection difficult. Seasonal flu vaccines are reformulated each year to tailor them to the virus types predicted to be most common in the upcoming flu season. If these predictions are off, the season’s flu vaccine may not provide optimal protection. Researchers have long been working toward a universal vaccine that could protect against all known influenza types and prevent future flu pandemics. Most of these efforts have focused on trying to induce the immune system to recognize areas of the virus that are similar between types. An NIH-funded research team led by Dr. Scott Hensley from the University of Pennsylvania tested a different strategy. They designed a vaccine that included a virus protein from all 20 distinct influenza types. Such a strategy hadn’t been possible with traditional vaccine production methods. But the researchers thought it might be with mRNA technology. This technology had been used for some of the vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. In their new study, the team made a vaccine using mRNAs for a key virus protein called hemagglutinin (HA) from all 20 influenza types. The mRNA was packaged in protective fatty nanoparticles. The researchers then tested the vaccine in mice and ferrets. Results were published on November 25, 2022, in Science. Vaccinated mice produced antibodies against both similar and unique regions of all 20 different HAs, and levels of these antibodies remained unchanged for months after vaccination. This robust antibody production occurred whether or not the mice had previously been exposed to one of the flu strains. When vaccinated mice were exposed to a flu strain similar to one of those in the vaccine, they stayed relatively healthy, and all survived the viral challenge. In contrast, unvaccinated mice exposed to the same flu strain did not survive. When the team exposed vaccinated mice to a flu strain that was less similar to the ones in the vaccine, the mice got sick but recovered faster than unvaccinated mice. Most of the vaccinated mice survived, but none of the unvaccinated mice did. Even when the researchers depleted T cells, which can also help protect again infection, from the vaccinated mice, the vaccine remained effective. This result showed that most of the protection was coming from the vaccine-generated antibodies. Finally, the researchers tested a two-dose vaccination strategy, similar to that used for COVID-19, in ferrets. A month after the second dose, they challenged the ferrets with an avian flu strain that was distinct from the ones used in the vaccine. Vaccinated animals got sick, but recovered quickly and all survived. In contrast, half of the unvaccinated animals died, and those that survived took longer to clear the virus from their bodies. “For a conventional vaccine, immunizing against all these types would be a major challenge, but with mRNA technology it’s relatively easy,” Hensley says. “The idea here is to have a vaccine that will give people a baseline level of immune memory to diverse flu strains, so that there will be far less disease and death when the next flu pandemic occurs.” This vaccine hasn’t yet been tested in people. But with further development, such universal mRNA vaccines have the potential to protect against both seasonal influenza viruses and those with the potential to cause pandemics. —by Sharon ReynoldsRelated LinksNanoparticle-Based Flu VaccineNewly Identified Flu Antibodies Could Improve Vaccines and TreatmentsDrug Mimics Human Antibody Against FluStudy Suggests Way to Improve Flu VaccinesMicroneedle Patch for Flu VaccineStrategy May Improve Seasonal Flu VaccinesFinding Factors That Protect Against FluSafeguarding Our Health: Vaccines Protect Us AllInfluenzaUniversal Influenza Vaccine ResearchReferences: A multivalent nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine against all known influenza virus subtypes.

Here we report that synthesized influenza virus FPs are membrane active, generating pores in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUV), and thus potentially explain both influenza virus’ hemolytic activity and the liposome poration seen in cryo-electron tomography. Experimentally, FPs are heterogeneously distributed on the GUV at the time of poration. Consistent with this heterogeneous distribution, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of asymmetric bilayers with different numbers of FPs in one leaflet show FP aggregation. At the center of FP aggregates, a profound change in the membrane structure results in thinning, higher water permeability, and curvature. Ultimately, a hybrid bilayer nanodomain forms with one lipidic leaflet and one peptidic leaflet. Membrane elastic theory predicts a reduced barrier to water pore formation when even a dimer of FPs thins the membrane as above, and the FPs of that dimer tilt, to continue the leaflet bending initiated by the hydrophobic mismatch between the FP dimer and the surrounding lipid.

In the first electron microscopy visualizations of purified viral spike proteins from rabies, rubella, influenza, and other viruses, a striking similarity between spikes from different viruses was the assembly of these purified viral spike proteins into aggregates, termed rosettes, as their hydrophobic trans-membrane domains (TMDs) aggregated1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Most enveloped viruses enter their target cells via the endocytic pathway, where the viral envelope spike protein encounters acidic pH. For the influenza virus spike protein hemagglutinin (HA), acidic pH activation of HA is necessary and sufficient for triggering fusion of the viral envelope to a variety of target membranes, including receptor-doped phospholipid bilayers1,2,9,10,11,12,13,14,15. In the absence of their TMDs, activation of isolated soluble ectodomains of HA led anew to fresh rosettes of those trimers1,2. The N-terminal domain of HA2 is responsible for this second aggregation of HA ectodomains – it is a short amphiphilic N-terminal sequence that became known as the fusion peptide (FP). As with the first rosette of HA, this second rosette formation is considered a consequence of the hydrophobic effect: the hydrophobic surface formed by one side of the FP would avoid water via association with the hydrophobic surface of another FP. The influenza FP comprises the N-terminal 21 amino acids of HA2, located within the HA ectodomain (at neutral pH), proximal to the HA trimer surface but near the TMD. At low pH the FP is found in the target membrane, as evidenced by hydrophobic photolabeling16,17. The FP is required for infection in vivo and membrane fusion in vitro and is featured in all hypotheses on HA-mediated fusion, though there is little agreement on the structural, compositional, and mechanistic data to date on its exact role18,19. Since the FP is a highly conserved region of the influenza virus genome across many different subtypes of influenza virus20,21, and a universal feature of enveloped viral fusion proteins, determining the FP’s role for infectivity and membrane fusion is critical to finding variant-independent immunogens and pan-viral therapeutics to ameliorate morbidity and mortality.We recently studied influenza hemifusion intermediates in vitro with high-resolution cryo-electron tomography using a phase plate to enhance signal-to-noise by a factor of four22. The cryo-tomograms of influenza viral-like particles and receptor-laden liposomes showed the expected 10 nm diameter hemifusion diaphragm in high cholesterol-containing target liposomes, but at lower cholesterol, exposed membrane edges were detected on the target membrane in direct contact with one or more HA still attached at their transmembrane base to the viral envelope; this lipid-protein structure can extend the FP outward from the virus linearly for many nanometers. These surprisingly stable large ruptures in the membrane were reminiscent of some of the earliest and most consistent clinical findings in virology (hemolysis) and a) suggested that fusion under these conditions is target-leaky to even large macromolecules and b) were consistent with the loss of target liposome contents in studies of intact virus-liposome fusion23,24. The target membrane lipid dependence for poration is also recapitulated for intact virions in a single vesicle dye entry assay25. From the existing literature on vesicle-vesicle fusion, it is hard to determine if the influenza FP alone is responsible for bilayer poration since earlier studies collected data during concurrent lipid mixing and phase changes26,27,28. The purpose of this study is to determine whether, and how, the influenza FP by itself could initiate stable pores in lipid bilayers.Here, in a study of the membrane mechanisms by which the influenza virus can disrupt a target membrane, we establish that FPs underly this disruption: in target membranes, a reversible pore forms upon addition of FP in the absence of virus or even the rest of HA. In MD simulations crafted to understand the chemistry by which FPs act, a third kind of rosette emerged: the aggregation of FP via their lateral side chains (not their hydrophobic surfaces) into FP microdomains that displace lipids in the cis leaflet. This aggregated structure locally thinned the bilayer and significantly increased the probability of water entry. A new model is proposed to explain our data based on a tilting of FPs towards each other to further thin the remaining lipids immediately under even an FP dimer. For larger aggregates, this more hydrated, thinner membrane structure replaces the lipid bilayer in a small domain wherein a lipidic pore can form.ResultsExperimental results: fusion peptide is sufficient to porate GUVStable pore formation, detected as passive transport of the water-soluble, membrane-impermeable fluorescent dye Alexa 488 into (influx) or out (efflux) of GUV, was monitored by confocal microscopy. Influx: GUV are immersed in Alexa 488 containing solution. Prior to FP addition, the interiors of GUV were dark. Upon addition of fluorescently labeled FP at neutral pH, FP bound to GUV (Fig. 1A, red). In fractions of the GUV (here defined as the leakage fraction), Alexa 488 accumulated inside the GUV changing the black interior to green (Fig. 1A, Influx). In other fractions of GUV, leakage was not detected and the absence of poration was deduced despite the binding of FP: no Alexa 488 influx was detected (Fig. 1A No Influx). The fluorescence signal increased until the signals detected inside (Fin) and outside (Fout) of the GUV were equal (Fig. 1B; representative examples; n = 7 from 2 independent GUV preparations); the influx ratio R = Fin/Fout = 1 is defined as 100% influx. GUV integrity was maintained during and after poration (the intensity and distribution of DiD lipid dye, labeling the GUV membrane, remained unchanged). Efflux: Poration was observed as a loss of GUV internal fluorescence with the efflux ratio, following normalization, R = (Fin−Fout)/(Favg(t=0)−Fout) = 0 defined as 100% eflux. POPC GUV encapsulating 3000 MW Alexa 488-labeled dextran showed 100% efflux into a non-fluorescent bathing solution (n = 2 from 1 GUV preparation). FP-induced pores in POPC GUV were a) stable on time scales that allow equilibration of the probe with the external medium, and b) large enough to allow transport of both 3000 and 570.5 MW molecules. Thus, the poration of GUV seen upon acidification of attached influenza virus or viral-like particles (VLP) was recapitulated with the addition of one part of the influenza HA—the FP.Fig. 1: Influenza fusion peptide induced poration of GUV.A Representative examples of DiD labeled GUV exhibiting binding of the influenza FP and no influx (top) or influx (bottom) of Alexa 488 containing solution following FP addition. B Kinetics of influx following FP addition. The ratio of Alexa 488 average intensities in the GUV lumen and the external solution as a function of time. Examples from 6 different experiments. For clarity, differently colored data are aligned in time such that 0 time indicates the onset of intravesicular fluorescence significantly above background. Inset shows a typical example of vescle undergoing influx at 11 and 26 sec after onset of influx (0 sec). White scale bar 5 μm. C Fusion peptide-induced poration (leakage) is dependent on target membrane lipid composition. Error bars represent the SEM of three independent preparations on the range of two (30% cholesterol). Closed circles: 0, 30, and 50 mol% cholesterol in POPC. Open red circle: 24 mol% DOG in POPC. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageSince viral-induced pores were preferentially detected in target membranes containing low cholesterol (<~40 mol %)22,25, the dependence of FP-induced pores on lipid composition was tested. Target membranes comprising higher cholesterol concentrations should hinder FP-induced poration. In the presence of FP, vesicle poration (Leakage %) of POPC GUV with varying cholesterol concentrations decreased with increasing cholesterol concentration, consistent with our hypothesis (Fig. 1C, n = 3 independent GUV preparations evaluating 50 − 100 GUV per experiment); leakage decreased from ~80 to 40% for cholesterol concentrations 30 and 50 mol% corresponding to leakage decreases of 34 and 48%, respectively, relative to 0 mol% cholesterol.The ring structure of cholesterol confers rigidity to membranes and this property could explain the observed decreasing leakage with increasing cholesterol. To determine whether cholesterol-induced rigidity or if negative monolayer spontaneous curvature (MSC) of the GUV leaflet is a correlating parameter, GUV were prepared with the same MSC (~–0.258 nm–1) as those of the highest cholesterol concentration used in this study (50 mol %), by replacing cholesterol with 24 mol % dioleoyl glycerol (DOG). The MSC of cholesterol, DOG, and POPC used in the calculations of the mixture MSC are: –0.494, –0.99, and –0.022 nm–1, respectively29,30 and we use the commonly accepted approximation that the MSC of a lipid mixture is defined as a concentration weighted average of the component MSCs29. 24 mol % DOG GUV did not exhibit statistically different leakage fractions from 50% cholesterol GUV (40.3 ± 8.2% for 50 mol % cholesterol compared to 49.3 ± 4.4% for 24 mol % DOG; mean ± SEM, n = 3, respectively; p = 0.39, 2-tailed equal variance T-test; Fig. 1C). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that leakage and MSC are correlated parameters, and lipids with negative MSC, e.g. cholesterol or DOG, hinder pore formation31.According to the classical theory31, lipids can be described by their effective molecular shapes: (i) conical lipids have larger tail than headgroup cross-sectional areas, which leads to negative MSC; (ii) inverted conical lipids have smaller tail than headgroup cross-sectional areas leading to positive MSC; and (iii) cylindrical lipids have zero MSC. Lipids with positive MSC (inverted cone) tend to form structures with positive geometrical curvature like the pore edge, thus enhancing membrane poration and inhibiting fusion. Lipids with negative MSC (cone) tend to form structures with negative geometrical curvature like fusion sites, thus inhibiting membrane poration and enhancing fusion.To gain insight into the relative lifetime of the FP-induced pores with and without cholesterol, pore stability was monitored via the influx ratio, R, in the presence and absence of 50% cholesterol (Supplementary Fig. 1A). Pure POPC vesicles exhibited R close to 1 (>80%, n = 14 of 17 reported, have filling ratios > 0.95), consistent with stable pores over a time sufficient for equilibration with the outside concentration to occur (tens of seconds, Fig. 1B). In the presence of cholesterol, R ranged from ~0.1 to 0.6 (> 90%, n = 28 of 30 reported, have R < 0.6). The sub-maximal level of influx in these GUV and estimates of pore open time (Supplementary Fig. 1B) are consistent with a higher probability of pore closing in the presence of high cholesterol32. Thus, FP-induced pore lifetime is shorter in cholesterol/POPC GUV than in POPC GUV.To further confirm whether submaximal leakage indicates a pore closing event or a slowly flickering pore, a second marker (sulforhodamine B, SRB) was introduced 25 min later following the introduction of the first marker, Alexa 48833. Since SRB and Alexa 488 have similar molecular weights (559 and 643 g/mol, respectively), if a pore allows entry of Alexa 488 then the same pore should allow influx of SRB. Consistent with this hypothesis, when introduced simultaneously, Alexa 488 and SRB have comparable levels of influx (Supplementary Fig. 2A). However, if an initially open pore closes, then the influx of SRB would be restricted. Supplementary Fig. 2B shows the influx of Alexa 488 (the first soluble marker) when incubated in the presence of the FP, but, in this example, SRB was excluded when introduced later, i.e., there was no influx. Hence, over this time scale, FP-induced pores are not stable in the presence of 50% cholesterol although they are stable in membranes without cholesterol.Lastly, the question of FP aggregation was considered. Analyses of the distributions of FP in bulk solution and on the vesicle indicated that, in addition to an increase in the average amount of FP on the vesicle in time, the variability at the pixel scale (~500 nm2) also increases in time. In all experiments, the distribution of pixels for the best fit intensity surface indicated the presence of pixels with larger intensity deviations compared to solution; the differences between the peptide in solution and on the GUV is not explained by the differences in intensity but is consistent with the appearance, in time, of a nonuniform or segregated distribution of FPs. Specifically, poration occurs with a characteristic time, 101 + /− 22 sec, and normalized FP density, 2.7+/− 0.05, (mean + /− SEM; n = 9, including both Alexa 488 and dextran experiments), both log-normally distributed, where the characteristic time represents the difference between the time leakage is first detected and the time the normalized FP fluorescence on the vesicles increases above the FP fluorescence in solution (see Fig. 9 and aggregation analyses in Methods). The combined deviations from n = 9 experiments taken around the estimated poration time are shown in Fig. 2. The intensity deviations for FP on the GUV were broader with extended tails, relative to the solution distribution, indicating that many pixels have higher than expected intensities under the null hypothesis that the distribution of FP on the vesicle is the same as the solution distribution. The difference in dispersion between the two distributions is significant (n = 16,200 for both distributions, alpha = 0.00001, Ansari-Bradley test). This observation is consistent with the aggregation of FP at the optical pixel scale. The pixels with higher-than-expected peptide intensities are ~ 10 times greater than the average intensity in solution. With a nominal voxel size of 1 × 1 × 2 μm3 and all peptides in the voxel contributing to the intensity measured in a nominal 1 × 1 μm2 pixel, a rough estimate of the number of peptides present at these “hot spots” is ~ 36,000. Assuming a uniform distribution at the level of a single voxel, the number of FPs, when scaled to the MD simulation size (15 nm x 15 nm) is ~ 8; a value comparable to that used in MD simulations.Fig. 2: Peptides on vesicles at the estimated poration are not distributed randomly.The intensity deviations in solution (black) are narrower around 0 deviation (mean = −3.9e-5, variance = 0.096) while the intensity deviations for the bound peptide (red) include deviations greater than the largest deviations observed in solution (mean = 0.005, variance = 0.598). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageThe GUV experiments support the hypothesis that the FP moiety of influenza HA, when aggregated, is sufficient to porate membranes in the absence of the entire protein structure. The poration process is dependent upon GUV lipid composition. To explore the role of membrane composition, FP density, and potential FP interactions (peptide-peptide and peptide-lipid) in the poration process, molecular dynamics simulations of asymmetric membranes with varying numbers of FP were evaluated at the 1:1 chol:POPC bilayer composition that gave the maximal inhibition of poration.Molecular dynamics simulationsSimulations were performed with 1 (2.1 μs), 6 (2.1 μs), or 10 (21 μs) FP interacting with one leaflet of either POPC or chol:POPC membranes (Fig. 3). While the top-down images of 6 FP show little aggregation, there are clearly significant interactions among peptides for the 10 FP systems. These interactions are correlated with a loss of lipid tails beneath the clusters in the 10 FP systems for both POPC and chol:POPC and are a consistent feature observed for all cluster sizes detected throughout their trajectories (Fig. 3). Figure 4 shows top-down views of both 10 FP systems at 0, 11, and 21 μs as well as the cluster compositions as a function of time; Supplementary Fig. 3 presents the number and compositions of clusters for each microsecond. As these figures show, the peptides are separated at the start of the trajectory, and dimers are formed in the first several μs. In POPC, most dimers are relatively short-lived, lasting 2 μs or less, though a dimer of FP 7-9 remains stable from 5–21 μs (the end of the trajectory). There is qualitatively more clustering in chol:POPC, with 4 long-lived dimers (FP 8–10, 7-8, 1–9, and 5–7); these form shorter-lived clusters of as many as 6 FP with each other and assorted monomers. Hence, there is considerable mixing over 21 μs in both systems. Of note, the most stable dimers are antiparallel, with the two N-terminal helices interacting with one another. Interactions between FPs are primarily mediated by direct FP–FP interactions, rather than water or ion bridges. This aggregation may be surprising given the net negative charge of these FPs. However, because even a single FP leads to local membrane deformations, clustering of FPs decreases the net energy of the FP-lipid boundary of the system which stabilizes clusters (see Theory section below). Aggregation in the 6 FP systems is much more limited (Supplementary Fig. 4), as consistent with the lower peptide concentration. A detailed examination of aggregation as a function of concentration will be reported in future work using coarse-grained models.Fig. 3: Snapshots of microsecond time-scale MD simulations.Final simulation snapshots. POPC and cholesterol are shown in grey and red line representations; FPs are depicted as blue-ribbon diagrams with a translucent space-filling overlay in the top-down views. Side view of the final simulation snapshots are taken as a 40 Å section denoted by the dotted lines in the top-down views; lipids in the cis leaflet are depicted in darker shades to distinguish them. FPs are depicted in a Van der Waals sphere representation, with hydrophobic residues in grey, while polar residues are green and acidic residues are yellow.Full size imageFig. 4: Snapshots and clustering of microsecond time-scale MD simulations with 10 FP.Snapshots are shown at times 0, 11 and 21 μs of the 21 μs simulation. Plots show the cluster composition at each microsecond, with the symbol representing the number of peptides in a given cluster. The peptide colors in the plot correspond to the colors in the snapshots. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageThe effect of the FP clustering on the membrane is profound: aggregates displace lipids in the upper (cis) leaflet, curve the trans leaflet (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 5), and sit much lower in the leaflet than an isolated FP (Supplementary Fig. 6). As shown in Fig. 5A for two snapshots of FP in POPC from the 10 FP simulation, even an antiparallel dimer can displace lipids, and thereby come in direct contact with the trans leaflet. This can be understood as follows: FP monomers are cradled by adjacent lipids, as has been observed previously for extended surface-associated amphipathic helices34. In contrast, the inserted area of the dimers is too large to be covered by lipids in the same leaflet, and consequently the lipids are replaced by the peptide aggregate. The top two panels of Fig. 5B show views of the underside of the entire cis leaflet at t = 0 for both 10 FP bilayers. The hydrophobic undersides of the FP are only faintly visible indicating negligible lipid displacement. The bottom two panels of this figure show substantial displacement of lipids by 3 dimers in POPC at 17 μs, and by a hexamer in chol:POPC at 19 μs.Fig. 5: Dimers displace lipids.A Side view (top panels) and bottom view (bottom panels) of two FP in POPC when they are isolated (left, t = 1 μs) or in an antiparallel dimer (right, t = 15 μs). Peptides are shown as Van der Waals spheres with hydrophobic residues in cyan, acidic residues in red, and polar residues in green. In the side view, top leaflet lipids are depicted as dark grey lines while bottom leaflet lipids are in lighter grey. In the bottom-up view, only lipids in the top leaflet are shown, and they are depicted as grey spheres. B Same view as above, but for the entire POPC (left) and chol:POPC (right) leaflets at t = 0 when the peptides are isolated. As peptides cluster over the course of the simulations, lipid displacement becomes more pronounced. Lipid displacement was observed whenever clustering occurred. The undersides of the three dimers at 17 μs are shown for POPC (left), and for the hexamer at 19 μs in chol:POPC (right); the FP identities can be read from Fig. 4. Black scale bars are 1 nm in all cases.Full size imageThe structure of the helical hairpin also promotes dimerization and insertion. Specifically, irrespective of clustering or insertion depth, all FP in all simulations were seen as rotated from a reference state in which both N- and C- terminal helical components of the FP would be the same average distance from the bilayer midplane. This rotation was quantified by a roll angle ρ, (Supplementary Fig. 8), with the N-terminal helix of the hairpin beneath the C-terminal helix; similar rotations were reported by Brice and Lazaridis from simulations of a single FP in DMPC35. The FP roll angle was larger in the chol:POPC membranes, with <ρ> =56.0° ± 0.7 as compared to 51.6° ± 0.8 in pure POPC (mean ± SEM; p < 0.005, pooled t-test). The long axis of the peptides remained roughly parallel to the membrane surface, regardless of aggregation or membrane composition, though large (>25°) positive or negative tilt angles are occasionally sampled (Supplementary Fig. 8, tilt angle).This orientation of the FP differs from that of most amphipathic peptides, which consist of a single long alpha helix lying relatively flat on the bilayer surface. Partial vertical stacking of the two FP helices increases the peptides’ thickness projection along the bilayer normal, with the FP subtending a total thickness of ~15 Å. However, the rolled orientation of the FP does not prevent water molecules from penetrating this sparse layer, unlike the lipid leaflet that they replace. This rolling and concomitant thickening along the z-axis allow the FP assembly to replace lipids in the cis leaflet more easily than a linear amphipathic peptide would, and with less hydrophobic mismatch at the cluster boundary. Consistent with the increased leaflet thickness of chol:POPC compared to pure POPC, the larger value of ρ allows the FP to span a longer distance along the z-axis. Movies of each of the system snapshots shown in Supplementary Fig. 3, demonstrating peptide tilt and roll, are included as Supplementary Movies 1-6.Lipid displacement by the FP aggregate in turn leads to localized membrane thinning (Fig. 6 upper left). Thinning is most pronounced in the 10 FP chol:POPC system, which has the densest FP aggregates. The chol:POPC:10FP system thins by 4.5 Å in the region of the aggregate, to a bilayer hydrophobic thickness of 31.0 Å compared to 34.5 Å in the peptide-free case (Fig. 6). The POPC:10FP system thins by a more modest 2 Å (from 27.5 Å to 25.4 Å). This combination of thinning and lipid displacement leads to substantial deformation of the trans leaflet (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 5), as the leaflet bows towards the cis leaflet, so that the terminal methyl groups of the trans leaflet lipids can contact the hydrophobic underside of the FP aggregate. As anticipated, the extent of this deformation becomes more pronounced with increasing aggregate size (Supplementary Fig. 5). Because chol:POPC is a thicker bilayer than POPC and displays a greater extent of FP-generated thinning, the explicit curvature of the trans leaflet is more prominent in these systems (Supplementary Fig. 5). Also, the peptide rides higher into the aqueous media bathing the cis leaflet in chol:POPC when surrounded by lipid but inserts deeper into the membrane to abut the trans methyl groups, so the thinning itself is greater in absolute terms, and the lipid bounding the FP has a greater deformation in chol:POPC. In the theory on FP aggregation (below) this increased deformation creates a large line tension around the FP cluster and explains the slight bias towards FP dimer formation seen in chol:POPC (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 3).Fig. 6: Thickness and water properties for all systems simulated.Only atoms contained in a cylinder of radius 30 Å and centered at the origin are included (see Supplementary Fig. 7).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageThese geometric changes modulate the spontaneous curvature of each leaflet in ways not well-described by the traditional theoretical model of non-interacting FPs. The FP aggregate-dependent displacement of lipids in the cis leaflet, and the high degree of localized bilayer thinning, suggest that bilayers with FP present would be more susceptible to pore formation.While the conventional MD simulations presented above are not of sufficient length to generate pores or pre-pore configurations, they do yield information on water content. The free energies, F(z), for water in the FP-containing and FP-free POPC and chol:POPC bilayer systems are plotted in Fig. 6 (right) across the thickness of the bilayer. These profiles are obtained from the probability distributions of water (Eq. 6 in Methods) and are commonly termed potentials of mean force (PMF). All systems show low free energy in the well-hydrated headgroup region and a substantial free energy barrier in the hydrophobic hydrocarbon region. The barrier at the midplane (z = 0) for pure POPC is characteristic of most homogenous bilayers36; the metastable minimum at the midplane in chol:POPC results from chain ordering and is found in liquid-ordered phases37. Addition of a single FP only slightly lowers the free energy barrier, while the aggregates observed in the 10 FP simulations substantially alter the energy landscape. The barrier height is reduced by approximately 1.6 kBT for POPC:10FP, and the width at half-height by roughly 3 Å; the barrier height is relatively unchanged for chol:POPC:10FP but the width at half-height is reduced by 12 Å, indicating significant membrane thinning. Furthermore, the plateau region of the PMF around z = 0, which is characteristic of cholesterol-containing membranes, is absent in the 10 FP system. Aggregates of intermediate sizes from the 6 FP simulations have an analogous effect following the same trend as the extreme cases of 10 FP and FP-free – reduction of the barrier height and concomitant narrowing in the POPC membranes and narrowing with an associated shape change in chol:POPC. Since pore formation is presumed to be initiated by the formation of a water wire (see Theory section below), these reductions in the free energy for water can be taken as an indirect measure of the propensity of the aggregates to generate pores. The formation of hydrophilic pores is developed in the following section.The free energy of water in each membrane can be related to the permeability by the inhomogeneous solubility diffusion (ISD) model (Eq. 7)38. Fig. 6 (lower left) plots the inverse resistances to water permeability 1/\(\bar{R}\) evaluated from F(z) and the ISD model (Eq. 8). Since the permeability P is proportional to 1/\(\bar{R}\), it is most instructive to compare values of 1/\(\bar{R}\) between systems. The presence of FP aggregates leads to a ~7-fold increase in 1/\(\bar{R}\) for the case of 10 FP in pure POPC, while the 10 FP aggregate has a more moderate ~3-fold increase for the chol:POPC membrane. Even the presence of a single FP increases this ratio from ~5 to 10, indicating a stronger effect on the pure POPC membrane. Most notably, 1/\(\bar{R}\) for POPC:10FP is 13-fold larger than for chol:POPC:10FP, implying that the permeability to water is lower by a factor of 13 when cholesterol is present.TheoryFP clustering: The inhomogeneous distribution of FPs on the surface of GUV at the time of poration is consistent with the hypothesis that, following FP surface binding, FP aggregation is an important driver of poration. The MD simulations at varying FP concentrations show a cooperative activity of multiple FPs: aggregates thin the membrane (Fig. 6) and exclude cis leaflet lipid tails and illustrate elastic deformation of the membrane at the FP/membrane interface for even a single FP. Thus, FPs incorporated into the lipid leaflet can be considered as generators of boundary conditions that induce membrane deformations. We calculated the elastic contribution to the FP cluster boundary energy in the framework of the theory of lipid membrane elasticity39 assuming symmetric FP, as described in the Methods section.Bringing two FPs into close contact eliminates part of the peptide/membrane boundary, and consequently nullifies the deformations induced by that part of the boundary. Thus, nonzero boundary energy acts as a driving force for aggregation of FPs. Entropy-based forces lead to the lateral dispersion of the FPs at lower overall concentrations. The balance of these two forces results in some critical concentration of FPs, above which aggregation becomes possible. To ensure aggregation, the total free energy difference ΔE between the ensemble of clusters containing nclust FPs each and the system of separated FPs should be negative. We combine the elastic energy of the cluster (Ecluster), the elastic energy induced by single FP (EFP) and the free energy arising from the entropy of mixing (Eent) into ΔE = Ecluster – EFP + Eent and require ΔE to be negative as a condition for spontaneous clustering. FP aggregation is ensured when the normalized surface concentration (x) of FPs is above a critical concentration of FP (xc) where xc is the value of x satisfying the equation ΔE(x) = 0. For large clusters one can neglect the boundary energy of the cluster and entropy of the cluster ensemble (see Appendix in SI). The approximate expression \({x}_{c}^{0}\) for the critical concentration reduces to a simple Boltzmann factor of the energy induced by insertion of a single FP (for details see SI):$${x}_{c}^{0}={e}^{-\frac{{E}_{{FP}}}{{k}_{B}T}}$$ (1) For the elastic parameters specified in Methods (Calculations of the energy of elastic deformations of lipid membranes.), \({x}_{c}^{0}\approx 0.27\). The dependence of the critical concentration xc for aggregation on cluster size is weak and demonstrates that Eq. 1 is a reasonable estimate (see Supplementary Fig. 11). The optimal cluster size is calculated from the total cluster formation energy. There is a clear energy minimum at the cluster size ∼10 (Fig. 7). Note that this minimum is local, and at larger sizes the energy again decreases, predicting that larger systems should form macroscopic clusters. Thus, small FP clusters can form spontaneously, while the formation of larger clusters requires overcoming an energy barrier. Accounting for dipole-dipole attraction, one finds the formation of hydrogen bonds between contacting FPs will decrease the critical concentration xc and enhance the formation of the cluster.Fig. 7: Dependence of cluster formation energy on cluster size (per 1 FP).Dependence of the energy of cluster formation on its size for the super optimal FP concentration x = 0.3. Additional contributions to clustering are related to dipole-dipole interactions and hydrogen bonds between contacting FPs, but they are not accounted for in these calculations. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageThe pathway to pore formation: Since a cylindrical aqueous pore in a bilayer is the best pathway for lipid pore formation, the increased hydration of the FP domain bilayer (Fig. 8c, right) should lower the energy of formation of a critical intermediate state, the hydrophobic defect, without lipid reorientation40. Here, the side walls of the water filled defect are formed by hydrophobic lipid tails. The surface tension at the interface of lipid tails and water depends non-linearly (although monotonically) on cylinder radius, as water structure inside a small hydrophobic cavity differs from that in bulk water. This difference in water structure is accounted for in the framework of Marčelja theory41,42, where the energy of a homogeneous hydrophobic cylinder filled with water is:$${E}_{H}={\sigma }_{h}2\pi {Rl}\frac{{I}_{1}\left(\frac{R}{{\xi }_{h}}\right)}{{I}_{0}\left(\frac{R}{{\xi }_{h}}\right)}$$ (2) where σh is the surface tension at the macroscopic interface of lipid tails and water, ξh ∼ 1 nm is the characteristic length of hydrophobic interactions, and I1,0 are modified Bessel functions of the first and zeroth order, respectively. According to Marčelja’s theory, hydrophobic surface–water interactions are described by an order parameter that characterizes the hydrophobic surface-induced perturbation of the water structure. The associated free energy density is decomposed into a series with respect to the order parameter scalar field and its gradient. The final energy of the hydrophobic surface exposition is calculated by minimizing the total energy functional with respect to the order parameter distribution. The dependence of the cylindrical hydrophobic defect energy on its length l is linear. The length of the cylinder, l, and the cylinder radius, R, completely describe the state of a membrane pore, and with these two parameters, one can build continuous trajectories – from intact bilayer (R = 0, l = 2 h, where h is the leaflet thickness), to the hydrophilic pore (l = 0, R > 0). These trajectories have common features: 1) the transition of the hydrophobic defect to a subsequent hydrophilic pore requiring the surmounting of an energy barrier, and 2) the energy of the hydrophilic pore has a local minimum at some radius (approximately equal to the leaflet thickness h), i.e., the hydrophilic pore can be metastable40. The metastability is provided by the fact that, at a pore radius around typical lipid leaflet thicknesses, meridional positive curvature cancels equatorial negative curvature, making this region less stressed40. In POPC bilayers, the energy barrier to pore formation is high enough (∼40 kBT, kBT ≈ 4 × 10–21 J) to essentially prohibit spontaneous pore formation. This agrees with the experimental observation (Fig. 1) that the dye leakage from the GUVs occurs only after FP application. We previously found that the maximum of this energy barrier occurs at a hydrophobic defect radius of R ≈ 0.7 nm; the critical defect radius is weakly dependent on the elastic parameters of the membrane40.Fig. 8: Three possible ways to form a hydrophobic defect (orange rectangle).a purely lipid membrane; b flat FP cluster; c funnel-like structure in the FP cluster formed by tilted FPs. The hydrophobic defect length decreases from a to c.Full size imageThere are two main ways to induce membrane destabilization: (i) decreasing the energy of the hydrophobic defect by membrane thinning and (ii) making the pore edge energetically preferable by the addition of components with positive MSC, e.g. lysolipids. The membrane-disrupting amphipathic peptide piscidin 143 acts in the first way. Once embedded in the cis lipid leaflet, it can tilt to form a funnel-like structure that locally decreases bilayer hydrophobic thickness, promoting hydrophobic defects. Our MD simulations showed that FPs decrease membrane thickness (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Fig. 5) which should facilitate the formation of hydrophobic defects (compare Figs. 7a and 7b). However, the average bilayer thinning induced by FPs and the thickening induced by cholesterol are comparable: a chol:POPC:FP membrane has approximately the same thickness as a pure POPC membrane, and thus both should have comparable energy barriers to pore formation. In contradistinction, experimentally the former membrane is leaky, while the latter is almost non-leaky indicating an additional effect of FP apart from average membrane thinning occurs. This contradiction can be reconciled if FP clustering and tilting of the FPs towards each other in the cluster (Fig. 8c) leads to formation of a funnel-like structure. Now, the hydrophobic region of the cis leaflet almost vanishes, and the opening of the pore only requires a hydrophobic defect to span the trans leaflet.We calculated the energy barrier towards pore formation for each system considered in the MD simulations. The barrier is defined by the energy of the water cylinder spanning the bilayer (Ehydro) and the deformation of the membrane near the hydrophobic defect (Edef). The energy is evaluated relative to the energy of the state of distantly separated (minimally interacting), n FPs (nEFP).$${E}_{{barrier}}={E}_{{hydro}}\,+\,{E}_{{def}}\,{{{-}}}\,n{E}_{{FP}}$$ (3) To calculate the membrane deformation energy, we utilized the Hamm & Kozlov39 elastic model essentially in the same way used to calculate the deformation energy arising at the FP cluster boundary. We assume that the system is axially symmetric with respect to the axis passing through the center of the FP cluster or single FP and introduce a cylindrical coordinate system, O-r-φ. As FPs are hypothesized to tilt, specific boundary conditions were imposed onto the projections of lipid directors (time-averaged lipid tail orientations) onto the O-r axis (nr(r = R, φ)) and O-φ axis (nφ(r = R, φ)) of a cylindrical coordinate system. The boundary director depends on the FP tilt angle, FP insertion depth, and membrane thickness. Three reference points are considered for determining the dependence of the boundary director on these parameters. The first one is the single FP; the nr-projection of the boundary director (nmono) is defined from geometrical considerations44,45:$${n}_{{{{{{\rm{mono}}}}}}}=-\frac{h-{h}_{{FP}}}{\sqrt{{\left(h-{h}_{{FP}}\right)}^{2}+{h}_{{FP}}^{2}}}$$ (4) where hFP is FP hydrophobic thickness. By symmetry, the nφ−projection of the boundary director is zero. The second reference point is the membrane, squeezed at the FP boundary to match its hydrophobic thickness. Now the boundary director nh is defined from the condition of the deformational energy minimum. The last reference point is the FP cluster, where boundary peptides are tilted inwards or outwards of the cluster, and the hydrophobic and leaflet thicknesses match. In that case, the boundary lipid director equals the FPs tilt ϑ, describing the rotation of the FP’s long axis (see Supplementary Fig. 8). We interpolate these three reference points linearly:$${n}_{b}({h}_{b},\,\theta )={n}_{{mono}}+({n}_{h}-{n}_{{mono}})\frac{h-{h}_{b}}{h-{h}_{{FP}}}+\theta \frac{{h}_{{FP}}}{h}$$ (5) where hb is the thickness of the lipid leaflet at the point of contact with FP. The energy of the cylindrical hydrophobic defect is calculated in the framework of the Marčelja model41,42 according to Eq. 240. The calculation procedure was as follows. For a purely lipid membrane, we accounted for both the hydrophobic and elastic deformation energies arising in the hydrophobic defect vicinity. For FP-containing lipid membranes, we calculated the energy of membrane deformation around the FP cluster, in which FPs are tilted inwards by a 45◦ angle. The hydrophobic defect in this case spans only the trans-leaflet. The lipid boundary director was set in accordance with Eq. 5; hydrophobic defect length was set equal to the hydrophobic thickness of the trans-leaflet. The total energy was minimized with respect to the membrane deformations and the depth of the FP insertion hb (Fig. 8c). The hydrophobic defect radius, r = 0.7 nm, corresponding to the maximum of the energy barrier of pore formation, weakly depends on the elastic parameters40 and was taken equal for each system under consideration amended by the DOG-containing system. We assumed that the latter system has MSC equal to the cholesterol-containing one (as in the GUV experiments). The thickness and rigidity of this membrane are taken equal to the POPC membrane, as unsaturated DOG lipid tails should not affect lipid ordering. The results of the calculation are summarized in Table 1. There are two drivers of the poration inhibition – MSC and thickness of the membrane leaflet. A negative MSC restricts FP tilting, while increased thickness raises the energy of the hydrophobic defect. The chol:POPC system has the highest energy barrier for pore formation due to the highest bilayer hydrophobic thickness. The effect of FPs on the membrane poration is explained by the cooperative action of several FPs that can form a cluster capable of thinning the membrane during a fluctuation of mutual orientation and thus decreasing the energy barrier towards pore formation. DOG and cholesterol, due to their approximately equal negative MSC, inhibit pore formation in the presence of FPs by impeding FP mutual tilting. This suggests that it is not primarily the chemical structure of cholesterol per se that is responsible for cholesterol’s pore neutralization activity. However, cholesterol’s ability for leaflet ordering can inhibit membrane poration additionally by increasing membrane rigidity. An increase in FP concentration leads to an increased probability of cluster formation, and the larger cluster further lowers the barrier to pore formation; both factors facilitate pore formation.Table 1 Barriers to pore formation depend on lipid composition and FP cluster sizeFull size tableDiscussionFor viral pathogenesis, the essential topological event in cell entry occurs when viral and host cell membranes merge, an activity mediated by the FP. Here, synthetic HA FPs segregate on lipid bilayers to high density in occasional ‘hot spots’ at the time that pores form, replicating intact influenza virion and viral-like particles in porating POPC and cholesterol:POPC lipid bilayer membranes25. This HA FP-induced poration was inhibited, and poration lifetime reduced by including cholesterol in the target membrane. To investigate mechanisms, in silico MD simulations were implemented on lipid bilayers with increasing FP densities. Surprisingly, a novel structure emerged at higher FP densities: FP aggregated in the cis leaflet such that lipids were depleted and replaced by peptides; even the formation of a peptide dimer is sufficient to exert this lipid-displacing effect (Fig. 5). The FP/lipid domain had increased water concentration in the bilayer midplane; such a thinner and more hydrated membrane domain is hypothesized to porate more easily than a peptide-free bilayer. Membrane elastic theory was extended to accommodate a new intermediate to water pore formation where a funnel-like defect, comprised of tilting FP, thins lipid further by a) moving the hydrophilic edge of the FP towards the membrane midpoint and b) minimizing the length of the hydrophobic defect that acts as the barrier to poration. Increasing FP density increased hydration in the MD-simulated lipid tail region of the trans leaflet, in agreement with theory predictions for greater water entry under a FP aggregate due to a shorter hydrophobic defect. Thus, the synergy of these two effects on the membrane hydrophobic region under a FP aggregate (FP tilting to thin and increased lipid hydration) can explain how FP facilitate water pores in bilayers at the critical time when fluorescence evidence for FP aggregation is detected.In the presence of FP, spectroscopic measurements demonstrated release of contents from large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) composed of PC and PS/PC (1:1)27,46,47, consistent with subsequent electrophysiological recordings23, and electron and light microscopy22,25. While these findings indicated that the influenza FP and its analogs destabilize the membrane, they did not address whether these permeability changes are associated with stable pores. Here, in single FP-GUV experiments, fluorescent dye influx continued over minutes, suggesting that the FP-induced influx does not proceed via a short-lived transient flickering pore but rather via either a stable or constantly flickering pore33. The lipid dependence of FP-induced stable pore formation at neutral pH was the same as determined in the previous studies on intact virion and VLP25.Molecular dynamics simulations have demonstrated the ability of isolated FPs to distort the bilayer34. These simulation results are consistent with several studies describing the interaction between the FPs and model membranes. For example, x-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry indicate that the FPs destabilize DOPE membranes28,48. However, the effect of cholesterol on the estimated depth of penetration of FPs, based on trp fluorescence in vesicles containing singly brominated lipids is less than reported here49.MD simulations at higher density (6 and 10 FP) were motivated by the observation that hemagglutinin is densely packed on the virus surface. Specifically, the approximately 9.5 nm spacing22,50 implies that a centered hexagon of 7 HA can be contained in a square patch of 15.3 nm/side. Since there are 3 FP per HA, in principle, 21 FP could maximally fit in such a patch; our 10 FP systems, while dense, are well below this upper limit. MD simulations of spontaneously emerging aggregates of FP on a single leaflet yielded qualitatively different results from those obtained at infinite dilution. Now, the FP aggregated and displaced many lipids in the cis (top) leaflet, thereby thinning that leaflet. Whereas a single FP coexists with a large ensemble of lipid configurations featuring tails that can spread under the FP, lipid tails adjacent to the FP aggregate were only partially able to shield the hydrophobic underside of that aggregate. Furthermore, at the highest FP densities (10 FPs) the trans leaflet thins and becomes negatively curved (concave) as the terminal methyl groups interact with the remaining exposed regions of the aggregate’s hydrophobic underside (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. 3, and Supplementary Fig. 5). This curved region of the membrane is more permeable to water, as indicated by the substantial changes to the water PMF in the region of the FP aggregate and the increase in the water permeability (Fig. 6). These structural changes to the bilayer are expected to modulate the spontaneous curvatures of the individual leaflets in ways not possible for non-interacting FPs.Pores were not formed in any of the simulations, most likely due to an energy barrier incompatible with the microsecond atomistic simulation durations currently practical. Consequently, the analytic theory was developed to bridge the gap between simulation and experiments. Since the underlying ultrastructure of a FP membrane microdomain is radically different from that of a fluid mosaic FP-embedded bilayer, purely lipid leaflet elastic theory was modified to consider the work of bending the membrane into three possible intermediates of membrane poration. The tilting of FPs towards each other amid an aggregate, bringing their hydrophilic faces closer to the bilayer normal, was the most energetically favorable, with their hydrophobic faces shielding the largest fraction of the lipid tail from the full hydration of a water pore (see Fig. 8c). The use of membrane physical parameters of cholesterol or DOG-containing membranes in the calculations made pore formation less energetically favorable due to their significant negative MSC. Analytical calculations supported the experimental observation that the DOG-containing vesicles with the same negative MSC as cholesterol-containing ones exhibited a similar inhibition of poration (Fig. 1c), suggesting that it is not the chemical structure of cholesterol per se that is responsible for cholesterol’s pore neutralization activity. Compared to previous estimates for the lowest energy pathway in lipid bilayers composed of longer chain lipids, the FP/lipid hybrid bilayer has an even lower energy pathway to membrane poration40,51,52,53,54. Illya and Deserno observed qualitatively similar aggregation in their simulations of highly coarse-grained peptide/bilayer systems55; coarse-grained methods should be useful for further studying aggregation of these FPs.If an underlying evolved activity of the highly conserved FP is to aggregate, as demonstrated in this study and by the rosette formation described in the introduction, then aggregation may be due both to the hydrogen bond interactions of FP amino acid R groups seen in the MD simulations and membrane-mediated attraction shown in this work. Simulations of other amphipathic alpha helices43 do not show the aggregation described in this manuscript, potentially due to differential embedding of the two-component alpha helices unique to FP. The deep embedding of the N-terminal helix, consistent with previous measurements by the Lentz lab, is striking49. Is this aggregation of FP relevant to the membrane fusion of infection? A pore in a single bilayer (a target cell membrane) is not a fusion pore that links two bilayers (viral envelope and target cell membrane). Perhaps the work done by the FP microdomain comes later in the fusion process, after hemifusion diaphragm (HD) formation, when it would coat the merged leaflets trans to the HD. There it may induce a bone-fide fusion pore at the edge of the HD. In support of this idea, protein domain insertion at a distance (into a leaflet trans to the remodeling leaflet) lowers the activation barrier for fusion in two other membrane remodeling systems: PH domain insertion in dynamin-mediated membrane fission56,57 and cell-cell fusion where myomaker acts after myomerger to form the fusion pore58,59. In both systems, the protein domain action is thought to occur near or at a three-way lipidic junction56,58. Alternatively, FP from intact enveloped virions might rupture endosomes and enter target cell cytoplasm for subsequent envelope disruption and intracellular trafficking of the viral genome to the nucleus. Regardless, the FP condensate revealed here, displacing lipids from one leaflet, is remarkably like the recent caveolin1 structure, also proposed to displace lipids from one leaflet to form a faceted surface of a caveolae60; here alpha-helices also stack and provide sufficient thickness to match the lipid leaflet thickness at the lipid/protein boundary.Methods1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), cholesterol, and 1-2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol (DOG) were from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL) and other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), unless specified. Stock solutions of POPC (13.15 mM), DOG (3.22 mM), and cholesterol (20 mM) were made in CHCl3 (Burdick & Jackson, Mexico City, Mexico, high purity solvent) and stored in brown glass vials at –20 °C. Structures of FP analogs (synthetic amphipathic peptide with additional hydrophilic amino acids to their C-terminus) in the presence of phospholipid bilayer membranes or micelles are alpha-helical in their secondary structure with either a closed coiled-coil tertiary structure61 or an open ‘boomerang’ shaped tertiary structure62. A 23 amino acid synthetic peptide corresponding to the X-31 FP domain20 was custom synthesized by GenScript, NJ labelled with tetra-methyl rhodamine (Sequence: GLFGAIAGFIENGWEGMIDGWYG [LYS(TRITC)]). Stock solutions of FP in DMSO were stored at –20 °C. To compare the FP-induced membrane poration with intact X-31 influenza virus-induced poration25, this X-31 FP sequence was used20. To compare poration results to MD simulations, the H-serotype FP sequence was used55 (GLFGAIAGFIEGGWTGMIDGWYG). Poration results were similar for both FP sequences, irrespective of dye labelling.Experimental conditionsPreparation of giant unilamellar vesiclesGUVs were prepared by the gel swelling method as described previously63. Briefly, to prepare GUVs of a specific lipid composition the required amount of lipid drawn from individual stock solutions was diluted into 200 µl of CHCl3 to a concentration of 3.94 mM (3.35 mg/ml). The mixture was vortexed with ~10 µl of MeOH for ~2 min to avoid incomplete mixing and obtain a clear solution in CHCl3. 10 µl of DiD (Invitrogen; prepared in DMSO as a 5 µM stock solution) was added to this lipid mixture and vortexed for ~2 min. The lipid mixture (in CHCl3) was then deposited on a plasma cleaned (using a Harrick plasma cleaner, Ithaca, NY) microscope cover glass, coated with 5% (w/w in ddH2O) polyvinyl alcohol (Merck Millipore). The organic solvent was evaporated by a gentle stream of nitrogen and then stored in high vacuum for 1 h. The lipid film containing cover glass was then transferred to a 30-mm tissue culture dish. 500 µl of GUV formation buffer (1 mM EDTA, 1 mM HEDTA, 10 mM PIPES, 100 mM KCl, pH 7.4 with ~200 mM sucrose) was added covering the entire surface of the cover glass and allowed to incubate for 30 min in the dark. After 30 min, the GUVs were harvested by gently tapping the sides of the dish, then gently removing the GUV suspension using a 1 mL pipette without touching the surface and transferring to a 1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tube. The GUV suspension was stored at 4 °C until further use. The total lipid concentration of the GUV suspension was 1.35 mg/ml (1.58 mM). Typically, GUVs were made the same day of the experiment. To vary the MSC systematically, POPC GUVs of varying concentrations of cholesterol, or DOG were prepared.GUV poration assayFP was added from the stock solution to a suspension of GUVs at a peptide-to-lipid ratio of 1:200 in a microcentrifuge-tube. The total volume was diluted to 500 µl containing Alexa 488 or SRB. The mixture was then incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. While the FP-GUV mixture was incubating, 500 µl of a 5 mg/ml β-casein solution was added to a delta-TPG 0.17 mm dish (Bioptechs, Butler, PA) allowed to sit for 10 min to passivate the glass surface, and then washed 10 times with ddH2O. The FP-GUV suspension was then vortexed for 30 s and transferred to this imaging dish. For a given lipid composition, ~50 - 100 GUV were observed and scored based on whether they have undergone influx of Alexa 488. Leakage was determined ~15-18 min after FP addition to ensure equilibrium. The fluorescence intensity within GUV was monitored for an additional 30 min; no changes in the mean fluorescence intensity were detected after the additional waiting period. For kinetics measurements, the FP was directly added to the chamber contacting GUVs while mounted on the microscope objective.Confocal microscopyGUVs were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 880 microscope, controlled by the Zen Black software, using a 63× oil 1.4 NA Plan-Apochromat objective. The objective was heated (Bioptechs, Butler, PA) to maintain 37 °C inside the chamber (verified with a microprobe thermistor). Alexa 488, SRB and DiD were excited with 488, 543 and 633 nm lasers respectively and detected using PMT detectors on separate imaging tracks.Image, data, statistical and aggregation analysesMicroscopy images were analyzed using ImageJ (NIH). Data were analyzed using SigmaPlot (v12.5, Systat Software, Inc., Chicago, IL), Excel (v2016 and 2019, Microsoft, Inc., Redmond, WA), and MATLAB (v2018a – v2021a, The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA). The aggregation hypothesis predicts higher than expected concentrations of bound FP during poration. The polarization properties of a high NA objective produce a cosine-squared dependent modulation of an otherwise constant intensity64,65,66. To correct the intensity profiles recorded on GUVs, template matching alignment was employed (to minimize position jitter noise), using the ImageJ plugins (Template Matching and Oval Profile Plot). However, neither the observed profiles at a single time point, nor averaged over a subset of time points (5, for example) nor the entire time series could be described using either a single uniform orientation or two component mixtures of orientations, unlike the profiles predicted for a chromophore with identical orientations uniformly bound to the surface. Statistical evidence of FP aggregation on GUV includes pixels with larger than expected intensity, requiring consideration of both the slowly varying modulation around the circumference and the magnitude of the intensity, since variance increases with intensity. The aggregation analysis first calculated the intensity surface at the time of poration followed by an analysis of the distributional properties of the residuals. Direct calibration issues were avoided by normalizing the GUV pixel intensities into units of solution intensity calculated from the distribution of intensities along a 1-pixel wide ring matching the size of a GUV in cross-section (Fig. 9, inset). Since the distributions of FP intensity in solution, over time, often captured transient, FP-bound membrane structures, the distributions were modeled as a two component Gaussian mixture, with the lower intensity mean taken as the FP intensity in solution to be used in the normalization of membrane-bound FP. Possible changes to the chromophore properties following FP binding to the membrane were not observed because the initial normalized GUV intensity is approximately 1 (Fig. 9; solid horizontal line at ~ 1 for normalized GUV intensity values less than tcrit = 147 sec). Consequently, the intensity on the GUV surface is expressed in units of solution intensity that is directly related to the FP concentrations and designated as the normalized FP density. Note, the solution values are invariant with time, whereas the intensity of the FP bound to the GUV begins to diverge and increase with time. The extent of Alexa 488 influx (R = Fin/Fout; green trace) is also plotted and the time of poration indicated by the red arrow.Fig. 9: Kinetics of poration and FP accumulation on a POPC GUV.FP fluorescence signals were normalized by the FP mean intensity in solution (black data points). The time FP begins to accumulate on the vesicle, tcrit, was determined using piecewise linear fitting (solid black lines). The time, tpore, poration begins (red arrow) was determined using piecewise linear and exponential fitting of the Alexa 488 influx (solid green line). In this example, the characteristic time between FP accumulation and poration is 197 sec with a mean FP intensity at poration 3.5 times the solution intensity. FP mean intensity in solution was constant over time (dotted black line).

The data surface, defined by 3 parameters (radial angle, time, pixel intensity) were fit using locally weighted, smoothing quadratic regression (Lowess quadratic) with a data span of 20% to capture the complexity of the time, angle, and intensity of the peptide on the GUV. The same surface fits in solution were approximately planar. The spline-smoothed circumferential mean (over the five time points) removed any large scale (quadrant angle level) polarization-dependent intensity modulation of vesicle-bound FP. The resulting intensity deviations (residuals) were compared to the distributional behavior of FP in solution. The residuals represent both the positive and negative deviations around the circumferential mean; larger (smaller) than expected intensity deviations on the vesicle, when compared to the solution distribution are evidence for pixels with greater (lower) FP density. The spatial distribution of the FP intensities in solution represents the expected variation for orientationally random and spatially uniformly distributed data since the surface was a) approximated by a plane at a constant value of 1 (the normalized intensity) and b) the residuals were symmetric around 0.Molecular dynamics simulationsSystem preparationTwo membrane compositions were compared: pure POPC and 1:1 chol:POPC. Large systems were constructed with 10, 6, or 1 copies of the 23-residue NMR structure of the FP (sequence: GLFGAIAGFIEGGWTGMIDGWYG) determined by Lorieau et al.61 placed in the cis (top) leaflet of ~150 × 150 Å membranes. Smaller symmetric systems were also constructed with a single copy of the FP in each leaflet of ~75 × 75 Å bilayers for the estimates of spontaneous curvature listed in Supplementary Table 1. All systems were constructed using the CHARMM-GUI Membrane Builder67,68,69,70 with a water thickness of 17.5 Å and 150 mM potassium chloride in the solvent. Simulations utilized the CHARMM36 force field71,72 and TIP3P water model73,74, and were all performed in the isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble with a 2.0 fs time step.Long-time scale simulationsAll large simulations were simulated first in OpenMM version 7.4.175 using the Rickflow package version 0.7.0. OpenMM equilibration times were 1000 ns for 10 FP systems and 100 ns each for 6 and 1 FP systems. Following this, because of the large fraction of FPs in the cis leaflet, the 10 FP systems were simulated for 30 ns in CHARMM76 using P21 boundary conditions77 to allow lipids to equilibrate between leaflets. The number of lipids per leaflet was averaged over the last 7.5 ns of these P21 simulations; representative frames with lipid distributions matching this average were selected as starting coordinates for simulation on Anton 278. All large systems were then simulated on Anton 2 for production runs using Anton software version 1.56.0c7. The Anton 2 simulations times were 20 μs for 10 FP systems, and 2 μs each for 6 and 1 FP systems. The symmetric single FP systems were simulated for 500 ns in OpenMM. As controls for both system sizes, FP-free systems of comparable size (150 × 150 Å and 75 × 75 Å) were simulated for 500 ns in OpenMMAll OpenMM simulations were performed at 310 K with the Nose-Hoover chain79,80,81 velocity Verlet integrator implemented in Openmmtools82 and the Monte-Carlo membrane barostat83. Bonds with hydrogen were constrained using the SETTLE and CCMA algorithm84,85. A 12.0 Å cutoff was used, with a force-switching function from 8−12 Å. Long-range electrostatics were treated using the particle mesh Ewald method86. Coordinates and velocities were saved every 50 ps. Simulations on Anton 2 utilized the Multigrator framework87 with the Nose-Hoover thermostat (310 K) and semi-isotropic MTK barostat. An 8 Å real space cutoff distance was used, and long-range electrostatics were evaluated with the u-series method78. Coordinates were saved every 200 ps.Simulation analysisThickness maps and leaflet position maps were calculated using the MEMBPLUGIN v1.188 extension for VMD, and all system snapshots were rendering using VMD89 v1.9.4a51. Lipid density plots were calculated using LOOS90,91 v 3.3.0. FP clustering was assessed using the cluster module of the freud Python library92 v2.11.0. All FP heavy atoms were considered in the analysis, and a cutoff of 3.5 Å, consistent with a typical hydrogen bond donor-acceptor cutoff distance, was used to define points as belonging to the same cluster. Peptide tilt angles were calculated by defining a tilt vector between the alpha carbon of residue 13 (midpoint of the bend) and the geometric center of the alpha carbons of residues 3 and 22 (the helical residues furthest from the bend) and calculating the angle of this vector with respect to the xy-plane. Roll angles were calculated in a similar fashion, with the roll vector defined between the alpha carbons of residues 3 and 22 (see sketch in Supplementary Fig 8). Water, lipid, and peptide density distribution profiles were calculated using the density function in cpptraj 1893 and a 0.5 Å bin width; only atoms within a cylinder of 30 Å centered about the origin (Supplementary Fig. 7) in the xy-plane were considered for this calculation (FP-containing systems were first imaged such that the FP aggregate was centered at the origin, in the plane of the membrane.) The PMF, F(z), was calculated from the normalized water density distribution, p(z):$$F(z)=-{k}_{B}T\,{ln}(p(z))$$ (6) Permeability and partition coefficientsThe inhomogeneous solubility diffusion (ISD) model38 provides a simple relation between the free energy profile and the resistance to permeability, R. The permeability P in the ISD model is written:$$\frac{1}{P}={e}^{-\beta {F}_{{ref}}}{\int }_{-h/2}^{+h/2}\frac{{e}^{\beta F\left(z\right)}}{{D}_{\perp }(z)}{dz}$$ (7) where \({D}_{\perp }(z)\) is the position dependent diffusion coefficient, \(\beta=1/{k}_{B}T\), h is the thickness of the bilayer, and \({F}_{{ref}}\) is the reference free energy in the water phase that is set to zero. The diffusion constant is not calculated here and will be assumed to be a constant \(\left\langle D\right\rangle .\) The resistance is then defined from Eq. 7 as:$$\bar{R}={\int }_{-h/2}^{+h/2}{{{{{{\rm{e}}}}}}}^{\beta F\left(z\right)}{{{{{\rm{d}}}}}}z=\left\langle D\right\rangle /P$$ (8) Note that the preceding definition of \(\bar{R}\) differs slightly from the usual definition of R, where the diffusion constant remains in the integral.Calculations of the energy of elastic deformations of lipid membranesTo calculate the energy of membrane deformations, we utilize the Hamm and Kozlov model39 according to which the lipid monolayer is considered to be an elastic continuous 2D media. The state of the lipid leaflet in this model is defined by the field of unit vectors n corresponding to the average direction of the lipid molecules, and the shape of the monolayer-water interface. We assumed that the system has an axial symmetry with respect to the axis passing through the center of the FP cluster or single FP. The energy functional comprises four contributions: bending (that is defined by the mean curvature J), tilt (t), lateral compression/stretching (α) and Gaussian curvature (kg) energy terms:$${{{{{{\rm{E}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\rm{def}}}}}}}=\int\limits_{{{{{{\rm{bilayer}}}}}}}\left(\frac{{{{{{\rm{B}}}}}}}{2}{\left({{{{{\rm{J}}}}}}-{{{{{{\rm{J}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\rm{s}}}}}}}\right)}^{2}+\frac{{{{{{{\rm{K}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\rm{t}}}}}}}}{2}{{{{{{\bf{t}}}}}}}^{2}+\frac{{{{{{{\rm{K}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\rm{a}}}}}}}}{2}{{{{{{\rm{\alpha }}}}}}}^{2}+{{{{{{\rm{K}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\rm{G}}}}}}}{{{{{{\rm{k}}}}}}}_{{{{{{\rm{g}}}}}}}\right){{{{{\rm{dS}}}}}}$$ (9) where B, Kt, Ka, KG, are bending, tilt, compression/stretching and Gaussian elastic moduli; Js is the monolayer spontaneous curvature. The integration is performed over both monolayer surfaces. The leaflet’s effective curvature is determined by the divergence of the director field: J = −div(n). The tilt vector is defined as a deviation of the lipid director from the normal N to the leaflet’s surface: t = n – N. The Gaussian curvature in the axially symmetric system is defined using the following product: \({k}_{g}=\frac{{n}_{r}}{r}\frac{\partial {n}_{r}}{\partial r}\), where nr is the projection of the director on the Or axis. The following parameters were used to calculate the energy of membrane deformations: Hydrophobic thickness and lipid MSC (Supplementary Table 1) were obtained from MD simulations; Js,POPC = –0.043 nm–1, Js,mix = –0.173 nm–1 for pure POPC and mixed chol:POPC membrane leaflets; bending rigidity for pure POPC membrane BPOPC = 11.2 kBT94 and for mixed chol:POPC Bmix = 13.7 kBT95. The lateral area of FP was taken to be 4 nm2. We used the following values for the remaining elastic constants: Kt = 10 kBTm2, Ka = 30 kBTm2, KG = –0.3·B kBT equal for both pure POPC and mixed membranes.To calculate the elastic energy due to insertion of a single FP, EFP, fusion peptides and mini-clusters were considered as rigid objects that impose boundary conditions on the directors44,45 nr(r = r0,φ), nφ(r = r0,φ), where r0 is the radius of single FP or their cluster and nφ is the projection of the director on the Oφ axis; parameters were as above. Directors and leaflet surface were constrained to be continuous everywhere except in the regions occupied by the FPs. The membrane was required to be unperturbed far from the cluster boundary. The elastic energy was minimized with respect to the membrane deformations and FP’s insertion depth. The detailed description of the calculation procedure can be found in Kondrashov et al.45.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Saving Lives, Protecting People Search Submit Influenza (Flu) Pregnant People Hit Hard by Flu But Many Remain UnvaccinatedFlu vaccines help protect pregnant people and their developing babies from potentially serious flu complications. EspaÃ±ol | Other Languages Print Minus Related Pages December 9, 2022—Flu season came early this year with some of the highest hospitalization rates seen at this time of the year in a decade. Preliminary data from CDC indicate that so far this season, nearly 50% of reported flu-associated hospitalizations in women of childbearing age have been in women who are pregnant. Concerningly, flu vaccination coverage among pregnant people is more than 10 percentage points lower than this time last year and more than 20 percentage points lower than it was prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving many pregnant women and their babies unprotected from flu this season. Flu activity is expected to continue for weeks, so it remains very important that people get vaccinated if they have not yet this season, especially people who are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications, like pregnant people. The Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET) is a population-based surveillance system that collects data on laboratory-confirmed flu-associated hospitalizations among children and adults through a network of acute care hospitals in 14 states. According to preliminary FluSurv-NET data, 161 out of 346 (46.5%) women 15-49 years hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed flu infection in this surveillance network as of the week ending December 3, 2022, were pregnant. Pregnant women are generally at higher risk of being hospitalized with flu, but the percentage of flu-associated hospitalizations in women who are pregnant reported to FluSurv-NET this season is higher than in previous seasons. During the 2018-2019 flu season 26.1% of hospitalized women 15-44 years were pregnant and in 2020-2021 37.4% of hospitalized women 15-44 years were pregnant. It is not clear what might be contributing to the increase in the proportion of women who are pregnant among those hospitalized with flu this season, but low flu vaccination uptake and increased testing for flu could be factors. Data on the vaccination status of the pregnant persons hospitalized in this surveillance system are not available yet. Changes to the immune system, heart, and lungs during pregnancy may make people more prone to severe flu illness that results in hospitalization. Flu also may be harmful for a pregnant person’s developing baby. Flu vaccination during pregnancy helps protect pregnant people from flu during and after pregnancy, reducing the risk of getting flu by one-half on average and reducing the risk of being hospitalized with flu by 40%. Vaccination during pregnancy also helps protect the pregnant persons’ infant from flu in their first few months after birth when they are too young to get vaccinated and at highest risk of developing serious flu complications among all pediatric age groups. This week, CDC is reporting an additional seven flu-related deaths among children, bringing the total so far this season to 21. During most seasons, 80% of pediatric deaths are among children who were not vaccinated against flu. Based on data from December 3, 2022, coverage among pregnant people as of the end of October 2022 is lower among all racial and ethnic groups compared to the same time last year, with the largest declines this season seen in non-Hispanic Asian pregnant persons and non-Hispanic White pregnant persons. Disparities in flu vaccination coverage by race and ethnicity also persist among pregnant persons, with non-Hispanic Black pregnant persons having the lowest flu vaccination coverage so far this season compared to other racial/ethnic groups. By race/ethnicity, flu vaccination coverage among pregnant persons was: 15.5 percentage points lower for non-Hispanic Asian pregnant persons (51.6% compared to 67.1%) 14.2 percentage points lower for non-Hispanic White pregnant persons (36.6% compared to 50.8%) 11.2 percentage points lower for non-Hispanic Other race/ethnicity pregnant persons (36.1% compared to 47.3%). The ‘Other’ group includes pregnant persons who are American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, and Multiple or Other race/ethnicities. 10.9 percentage points lower for Hispanic/Latino pregnant persons (34.4% compared to 45.3%) 5.0 percentage points lower for non-Hispanic Black pregnant persons (20.4% compared to 25.4%) Concerns about safety are often cited by pregnant people as a reason they are reluctant to get vaccinated, yet there is substantial evidence that flu shots are safe during pregnancy. Flu shots have been given to millions of people over many years with an excellent safety record. There is a large body of scientific studies that supports the safety of flu vaccine in pregnant people and their babies, and CDC continually gathers data on this topic. While vaccination for pregnant people is very important, everyone 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine each year for the best protection against flu. With flu activity high and expected to continue, there’s still time to benefit from the protection vaccination offers. Find a flu vaccine today: https://www.vaccines.gov/find-vaccines/.

NPS Photo / T. Lewis From May to early October 2022, a mother black bear with 3 cubs of the year frequented the park headquarters in Bartlett Cove foraging for wild foods along the roadside and near buildings. In mid to late October, one of the three bear cubs began acting erratically and showed signs of deteriorating health. Park biologists and officials from NPS and the State of Alaska made the difficult decision to euthanize the animal to protect public safety and other wildlife. Lab results revealed that the bear cub tested positive for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI). The following account details the bear cub’s symptoms and agency response. On October 11 the family group spent 2-3 hours near park offices. All cubs appeared active, healthy and were feeding on ground cone (Boschniakia rossica). The next day the family was seen near park housing where a park staff member noticed one of the cubs was often at a distance from the rest and not feeding like the others. On October 14th the mother passed by park offices around 1 pm with only two cubs. At 3:30 the third cub walked by moaning and sniffing, presumably looking for the rest of the family. The cub looked healthy and eventually moved off in the direction of the other bears. Black bear family near Glacier Bay National Park offices on October 11th, 2022. NPS Photo / T. Lewis On October 15th a single black bear cub was seen along the park road near the driveway to the park’s maintenance building stumbling, moaning, and approaching and trying to get under cars. The bear appeared to have trouble placing its paws on the ground and sometimes ended up falling on its head. There were no signs of trauma or discharge from mouth or eyes and the bear looked healthy except for its movements. A park biologist was able to coax the bear to the road shoulder, but the bear remained in the area throughout the rest of the day. The next morning (October 16th) park staff observed the cub in the same area having seizures and foaming at the mouth. After the seizures ended the cub slept in the same location all morning and afternoon until nightfall. Black bear family near Glacier Bay National Park offices in August 2022. NPS Photo / T. Lewis The following morning (October 17th) the cub was gone from its previous location. Park staff found the cub later in the day ambling clumsily back and forth across the road in the same area. At this point the cub seemed to be blind and deaf with no response to sights or sounds. The bear moved constantly, often walking in circles and running into buildings and objects. Park staff herded the cub into a temporary enclosure for public safety. The bear circled the enclosure, mostly clockwise, bumping into the walls. For the next three days (Oct. 18-20) the cub alternately slept or walked in circles. Occasionally the bear investigated the enclosure but made no efforts to climb out or escape the enclosure. The bear did not respond to sight or sounds, showed no interest in water, and responded only slightly to smells of people. The park biologist consulted with federal and state biologists and veterinarians and all agreed that the cub should be euthanized to protect people and other wildlife in case the bear had rabies or Avian Influenza or another communicable disease. On October 20th a state biologist euthanized the animal with a .22 caliber rifle. A quick assessment found the cub to be a male with no broken bones or obvious signs of trauma. The enclosure had no signs of vomit, feces, or any other discharge from the bear during his 3 days there. The carcass was sent to the state veterinarian for necropsy. The approximately eight-month-old, 32-pound cub was found to be generally in good body condition but had hemorrhaging along the left side of the skull and a swollen brain. Laboratory analysis results found the bear to be negative for rabies and canine distemper but positive for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in brain tissue as well as nasal and rectal swabs. HPAI has been detected in only one other black bear, in Quebec in June 2022. In Alaska the virus has previously been detected in only two mammals, both red foxes, but has been detected in numerous wild and domestic birds throughout the summer and fall. The bear cub was likely exposed to the virus by consuming an infected bird. For more details see Black bear cub in Alaska diagnosed with Avian Influenza. Avian Influenza has not been detected in any other animals in Glacier Bay National Park, but park biologists will continue to monitor wildlife populations and send deceased animals in for laboratory testing. If you see sick birds or mammals behaving strangely, please report immediately to park staff, Alaska Department of Fish and Game, or U.S. Fish and Wildlife Hotline: 866-527-3358.

Observed December 5â9 this year, NIVW is a nationwide call to action to encourage everyone 6 months and older to get their annual flu shot, especially young children and others at higher risk. The more people vaccinated against flu, the more people are protected from flu.Vaccination is particularly important for people who are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications, including young children. Millions of children get sick with flu every year, and thousands will be hospitalized. Since flu viruses are constantly changing and protection from vaccination decreases over time, getting a flu vaccine every year is the best way to prevent flu.Â Flu vaccines are the only vaccines that protect against flu and are proven to reduce the risk of flu illness, hospitalization, and death.Vaccination in December or later is still beneficial, particularly as flu activity is high and continues to increase across the country. Vaccines are particularly important for people who are most vulnerable to developing serious flu complications, including people with HIVâespecially those with very low CD4 counts or who are not on treatmentâand other health conditions. In fact, in past flu seasons, 9 out of 10 adults hospitalized for flu had at least one underlying medical condition.Many Vaccine OptionsFor the 2022â2023 season, CDC recommends use of any licensed, age-appropriate flu vaccine. These include:Injectable flu vaccines, or flu shots. These include: Flu shots that are made with inactivated viruses.One flu shot that is made without influenza viruses.AÂ live attenuated influenza vaccine, which is given by nasal spray. (Note: People with HIV should receive the flu shot rather than the nasal spray.)There areÂ many flu vaccine options, and CDC does not recommend any one vaccine over another. Different vaccines are approved for different groups of people.Some flu shots are approved for use inÂ children as young as 6 months oldÂ and others are approved for use inÂ adults 65 years and older.Flu shots also are recommended forÂ pregnant peopleÂ and people with certain chronic health conditions.The nasal spray flu vaccine is approved for people from age 2 to 49 who are not pregnant. People who are pregnant and people with certain medical conditionsÂ should not receive the nasal spray flu vaccine.Getting a flu vaccine is the best way for everyone to protect themselves and their loved ones from flu.

Authored by by Alex Riley Wordcount December 7, 2022 | 1,900 words, about 9 minutes Share Article body copy Bernie sniffs the disembodied wing, picks it up in his jaws, and runs away. Four years after we adopted him, our dog’s recall is generally a point of pride. A sharp blast on a pea whistle helps when his mind drifts. But even that will fail when he’s found something disgusting or rotten. A bloated seal carcass to rub himself on. A catshark washed up in the surf. The remains of a seabird. After 20 seconds or so, I manage to tempt Bernie away from the wing, mostly sinew with a few cream-colored feathers, probably a gull of some kind. Kittiwakes, little gulls, herring gulls: they all frequent the shores of southwest England that my family and I call home. All told, Bernie is acting like a typical dog—an opportunistic scavenger. In my head, however, this banal scene flashes into a dire vision: another pandemic. For months, I have been following the media coverage of the devastating outbreak of avian influenza as it’s killed thousands of seabirds in Scotland. In the summer of 2022, gannets and skuas on Scotland’s remote isles started behaving oddly. They walked in circles as if intoxicated. Their heads swelled. They dragged their limp wings at their sides, feathers grazing the ground. At a time when they should have been breeding and raising new life, they were dying. Scientists and birdwatchers had a front-row seat to an ecological disaster. More than two-thirds of the world’s gannets and great skuas—birds that migrate across the Atlantic Ocean from eastern North America to western Europe—are feared to have been lost. As the influenza tore through seabird colonies near my home, it also spread over the Atlantic into eastern Canada, through the United States, and, most recently, into South America, jumping into new hosts as it went. Eagles, pelicans, and even mammals such as red foxes, seals, and bears have died after coming into contact with infected birds. The ongoing avian flu outbreak has killed thousands of birds, including two-thirds of the world’s great skuas. This bird was spray-painted orange by scientists. Photo by Danni Thompson/Alamy Stock Photo. All of this is incredibly unusual. Seabirds shouldn’t die from the flu. The type of influenza virus that infects birds—known as influenza A, or bird flu—is traditionally mild; most birds don’t show any sign of sickness. Its natural habitat is within the digestive systems of seabirds and waterfowl, such as ducks and geese. It spreads through bodily fluids and fecal matter in the water. It’s a natural part of wetland and coastal ecosystems. But this outbreak has killed thousands of seabirds. It has also survived through the summer, a season usually free from influenza in the northern hemisphere. And it jumps into mammals, an entirely new host, with aplomb. The situation has scientists wondering: is this the new norm? And if so, should we be concerned that it will adapt to, and spread through, humans next? There are four main types of influenza: A, B, C, and D. While all are capable of causing illness in humans, types A and B cause the majority of infections in flu season. One of the predominant strains we have vaccines for, known as H1N1, was responsible for the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic that killed more than 50 million people. Only influenza A viruses are known to cause pandemics. The flu currently circulating through bird populations up and down Atlantic coastlines is a type of influenza A known as H5N1. That’s the virus’s short name. The only people who use its full name—H5N1-HPAI-clade 2.3.4.4b—are typically scientists who study emerging viruses, such as Nichola Hill at the University of Massachusetts Boston. Hill wishes influenza scientists had come up with a simple nomenclature, like the Greek alphabet used to name COVID-19 strains, “but we just didn’t,” she says. A pain to say aloud, which Hill does often (“… clade two point, three point, four point, four B”), this name nonetheless explains the virus’s backstory: where it originated and why it’s so deadly. Let’s start at the end—2.3.4.4b—which is the virus’s clade. A clade is a group of organisms with a common ancestor. For example, humans are in the hominoid clade along with apes. Clade 2.3.4.4b first emerged some time around 2015 through the merger of a virus found on poultry farms and a virus that circulates in wild birds. It’s a hybrid, which is not unusual: the whole family of influenza A viruses trades and mixes its genes whenever it meets, trying out new combinations of H and N proteins (H5 with N1, or H3 with N2) just as we change our clothes. Working backward, the next part of the virus’s name, HPAI, stands for highly pathogenic avian influenza, a form of bird flu that kills more than 75 percent of chickens in a laboratory setting in less than 10 days. That kind of lethality, Hill says, “never, ever, ever, ever [evolves] in wild birds.” H5N1-HPAI-clade 2.3.4.4b started out as a milder influenza, a so-called low pathogenic avian influenza circulating in the wild. For its own survival, a virus shouldn’t kill its host, at least not quickly. If it were only spreading through waterfowl and seabirds, such virulence would be an evolutionary dead end. The virus would burn itself out. Only when the virus spread from domestic geese into industrialized chicken farms did it become such a killer. Poultry farms are constantly replenished with near-identical chickens, meaning a virus can keep spreading with ever-greater ferocity. “The virus doesn’t mean to, it doesn’t want to, but that’s the pathway that allows for the virus to replicate successfully in that population,” says Hill. Industrial poultry production has shaped the types of bird flu that surround us and increased the possibility that viruses can spill over into human populations. Most infectious diseases, author David Quammen writes in Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic, “are not simply happening to us; they represent the unintended results of things we are doing.” Viruses multiply in their hosts’ cells and spread to new hosts when an opportunity arises. Time is crucial. Unlike previous avian influenzas, H5N1-HPAI-clade 2.3.4.4b has had more time than usual to replicate. The virus has been infecting birds throughout the summer in the northern hemisphere, a period once thought to be too hot for its survival. Paul Digard, a virologist at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, wonders if the virus evolved to be more environmentally stable. “That might explain also why we’re getting so many more poultry infections, because [the virus] is just hardier,” he says. “It takes longer to die.” Digard is digging into that possibility, but the answer may be more complex. “It could also just be chance,” he says. The virus may have infected two neighboring birds at just the right time to jump into a new type of host. “Two spinning wheels have intersected at the wrong point of the virus life cycle,” Digard says. For the virus, however, it was the right point—an opportunity. The actors in this chance event are hard to pin down. Since 2018, this virus has been circulating widely through wild bird populations in the vast European melting pot. The virus may have made multiple incursions into seabirds. Great skuas are scavengers, and sometimes cannibalistic, and could have eaten an infected bird close to their breeding colonies in Scotland, Iceland, and Norway. Once there, the virus would have found the perfect environment in which to replicate. Dense populations, all pooping and jostling for space, shedding their viral loads to their neighbors. The fact that it was warm might have been an insignificant brake on the proceedings. By infecting migratory seabirds at the right time and in the right place, clade 2.3.4.4b was able to make a journey no HPAI we know of has made before: crossing the Atlantic Ocean. Historically, HPAI influenzas in North America have either emerged locally or crossed the Pacific. Yet in December 2021, the virus was found in domestic birds in St. John’s in Newfoundland and Labrador, likely caught from infected seabirds that flew over through Iceland, Greenland, and the Canadian high Arctic. The latest data from the US Department of Agriculture shows the clade has since spread across the United States up to Alaska’s western coast. With flocks moving up and down the Atlantic Flyway, the invisible highway that birds use to migrate from North America to the Caribbean, Central America, and South America, the virus has already migrated far south. Late in November 2022, roughly 14,000 seabirds, including pelicans and blue-footed boobies, died along the coast of Peru. Each body was disposed of in a black bin bag. In short, this outbreak of bird flu is unprecedented. What happens next is anyone’s guess. “It might mean that the virus is just going to become endemic [in wild birds] for a while,” says Digard. The birds that have already survived infection might harbor some innate resistance, and in time that immunity may spread. In the meantime, this highly lethal flu will be a constant threat to avifauna around the world. The virus’s persistence and geographic spread also raise the risk of it spilling over into humans. “It’s hard to predict, but there’s no reason why it can’t happen,” Digard says. Since April 2022, H5N1-HPAI-clade 2.3.4.4b has infected two people, one in the United Kingdom, one in the United States. Both caught the virus from domestic birds, and both were asymptomatic. But it’s a sign that this virus is at least somewhat familiar with our biology. The virus has also evolved to evade the immune systems of mammals, animals that are much more closely related to us than birds. Though rare, each such case is a step closer to spreading between humans. “They’re all low probability events, but potentially high consequence, so you have to worry about them,” Digard says. The current strain of avian flu, H5N1-HPAI-clade 2.3.4.4b, has shown itself capable of jumping to mammals. The spread has led to the death of seals in the Gulf of Maine. Photo by Michael Doolittle/Alamy Stock Photo As ominous as this bird flu appears, there are also signs that this virus is evolving away from human transmissibility. Samantha Lycett, a molecular epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh who studies the genetic evolution of influenza, has yet to see the sort of mutations that allow the virus to threaten our bodies. To Lycett, H5N1-HPAI-clade 2.3.4.4b appears content in wild birds. “It’s doing quite well for itself,” she says. “You are getting these spillovers [into mammals], but is that basically because there’s just a lot of [the virus] about? I think that probably is the case.” Short of the virus increasing its ability to leap into humans, Digard says, “I also worry that if you have lots of dead birds in the environment, then domestic cats are going to be interested, dogs are going to be interested.” Dogs like Bernie. “I really wouldn’t want to see cases of infection of pets,” he adds. While some infectious diseases emerge from our forays into a cave or a patch of forest, avian influenza has unfurled around coastlines, easily accessible conduits to human communities. Even if this particular variant doesn’t spread through our species, our collective conscience should be heavy. Indirectly, we gave birth to this highly pathogenic menace.

Image Image Photo by WDFW Caption WDFW biologist collecting dead snow geese suspected of avian influenza on Camano Island near Skagit Bay in Dec. 2022. WDFW staff wear gloves and fully decontaminate their clothing and equipment after these collection efforts. WDFW continues to ask members of the public who find sick or dead birds to report them immediately and not touch them. WDFW statement Dec. 8, 2022 Media contact: communications@dfw.wa.gov Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) biologists recently responded to reports of sick or dead waterfowl in western Skagit County on and around Skagit Bay, as well as in northwestern Snohomish County and on Camano Island and Port Susan in Island County. WDFW has retrieved more than 700 deceased birds of several species—primarily juvenile snow geese—from this area. Samples have been taken from these birds for testing for avian influenza (also known as bird flu), with H5N1 strain Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) suspected. WDFW continues to ask members of the public who find sick or dead birds to report them immediately using this online form and not touch them. As resources are available, biologists may respond to remove bird carcasses and, if in an area or species where avian influenza has not been confirmed, test for the virus. Due to the magnitude of this outbreak, WDFW staff will not be able to respond to all reported cases. Infected birds may appear lethargic, unable to fly, and exhibit wheezing, vomiting, or have diarrhea or secretions from their mouth or nostrils. More detailed information about avian influenza is available on this WDFW webpage and in this blog post. Avoid all contact with sick and dead birds. DO NOT attempt to move sick birds to a veterinarian or rehabilitation center, or to your home, as this can spread the disease. If a dead bird must be moved, it is best to wear disposable gloves while handling it and to double bag and dispose of the carcass in the garbage where pets and scavengers can’t reach it. Reports of suspected avian influenza in domestic flocks should be sent to the Washington State Department of Agriculture. Call 1-800-606-3056 or visit their webpage for more information about how to protect poultry and other domestic birds. From fall through spring, western Skagit County, Island County, and northwestern Snohomish County are major feeding and roosting areas for snow geese and other migratory waterfowl. The recent avian influenza hotspot around Skagit Bay follows a similar outbreak in November around Wiser Lake in Whatcom County. More than 450 dead birds have been removed from that area. HPAI is very contagious among birds but the risk to people is low. This current strain of bird flu does not appear to easily infect humans. As a precautionary measure, people with known extended contact with infected birds should contact their local health department if they develop flu-like symptoms. For hunters, waterfowl and other birds that appear healthy or are actively flying likely present minimal risk but should be cooked thoroughly before consumption. Dead geese and ducks found in western Skagit and Whatcom counties and northwestern Snohomish County are likely the result of avian influenza. Goose hunting has been closed in this area (Goose Management Area 1) since Nov. 27 and will reopen Dec. 10 through Jan. 29. Dogs and other animals can become sick with avian influenza, and care should be taken to avoid contact between pets and either sick birds or carcasses of diseased birds. Wherever possible, maintain control of and discourage your dog from touching birds that were not shot immediately beforehand. To reduce the risk of disease transmission, hunters are asked to not clean and dispose of bird carcasses in the field, but to do so at home and to double bag and dispose of bird carcasses in the garbage. Additional safety tips include: Wear disposable gloves when cleaning harvested birds or cleaning bird feeders. Do not dispose of processed carcasses in the field where they could be eaten by raptors. Bag them and place in the garbage, bury, or incinerate them. Take special precautions to ensure that all equipment (boots, clothes, vehicles, firearms) are cleaned and disinfected to prevent the spread of diseases. Do not harvest or handle wild birds that are obviously sick or found dead. Do not eat, drink, or smoke while cleaning game. Wash hands with soap and water or alcohol wipes immediately after handling game or cleaning bird feeders. Wash tools and work surfaces used to clean game birds with soap and water, then disinfect with a 10 percent solution of chlorine bleach. Separate raw meat, and anything it touches, from cooked or ready-to-eat foods to avoid contamination. Cook game birds thoroughly. Meat should reach an internal temperature of 155 to 165 degrees Fahrenheit to kill disease organisms and parasites.

Felix (Drew) Bigby, interim director of Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, gives the thumbs up upon receiving his flu vaccination in October at WRNMMC. News | Dec. 5, 2022 National Influenza Vaccination Week Highlights the Importance of Immunization By Bernard Little, WRNMMC Command Communications WRNMMC, Bethesda, MD – This year’s National Influenza Vaccination Week, observed Dec. 5-9, serves as a reminder as it does each year, for people 6 months and older to get the flu vaccine. Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC) has administered approximately 9,800 flu vaccinations as of Dec. 2 since this year’s flu vaccination campaign began in October, according to Army Staff Sgt. William Tarver, senior enlisted leader (SEL), Pulmonary Services. Tarver also serves as SEL for WRNMMC’s COVAX Site in Building 9 (Arrowhead), where staff and beneficiaries can receive both the flu vaccination and COVID booster by showing their Common Access Card (CAC) or military/family member identification. “The current projected end date for the flu vaccination campaign is Dec. 15,” Tarver stated. Also, the flu vaccine and COVID booster can be given at the same time. TRICARE also covers the flu vaccine at most local pharmacies if beneficiaries are unable to get to WRNMMC to receive their vaccination. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), influenza vaccination is particularly important for people who are at higher risk of developing serious flu complications. These individuals include: Infants and children ages 5 and younger Adults ages 65 and older Pregnant women (and women up to two weeks postpartum) People with certain chronic health conditions (heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, compromised immune system, and obesity) Children younger than age 5 – especially those younger than age 2 – are at higher risk of developing serious flu-related complications because their immune systems are still developing, according to the CDC. Flu can be dangerous for children because complications can include dehydration, ear infections, pneumonia, hospitalization, and death. This year, health care providers are particularly emphasizing the importance of vaccination because of the risk for increased illnesses due to COVID-19, as well as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which has especially affected children. Adults ages 65 and older are at greater risk of flu-related complications, in part because of decreasing immune function with increasing age. Flu is more likely to cause severe illness in pregnant women because during pregnancy, it is harder for a woman's immune system to fight infections, according to the CDC. National Influenza Vaccination Week also occurs as the holiday season gets underway to highlight the importance of immunization because of increased travel and exposure to others and crowds during this time of year, which heightens the chances for exposure to germs. Since flu viruses are constantly changing, and protection from vaccination decreases over time, getting a flu vaccine every year is the best way to prevent flu, explained Navy Capt. (Dr.) Rachel Lee, chief, Allergy Immunology, and Immunizations at WRNMMC. Flu vaccines are the only vaccines that protect against the flu and are proven to reduce the risk of flu illness, hospitalization, and death, Lee continued. She explained although flu activity usually peaks between December and February following the holidays, flu activity sometimes occurs as late as May. “The best time to get your flu vaccine is before the flu spreads in your community, so get the vaccine now,” Lee shared. “The COVID-19 pandemic has helped more people recognize the importance of prevention because of the significant health and social impacts of these vaccine-preventable infections. We’re all in this together, so do your part and get your flu vaccine,” she added. Lee explained while there may be mild side effects in getting the flu vaccine for some people, there are far greater benefits to being vaccinated than not. “All vaccines may have some side effects, which is balanced against the benefits of preventing illness and death. Common side effects include injection site pain and/or swelling, fatigue, body aches, fever, and headache,” she stated. According to the CDC, the flu shot does not contain the live flu virus and cannot make you sick. Vaccine side effects usually go away within a few days, health care providers add.

Many centres, like the Baldersgade Vaccination Centre in Copenhagen, are offering 2 or 3 vaccines to eligible people at the same time – influenza, COVID-19 and pneumococcal vaccines – this autumn and winter. An mpox (monkeypox) vaccine is also available at the Centre for people who need it. Nearly 3000 people get vaccinated in Copenhagen every day. These testimonies and photos from the Centre show some of the city’s health workers getting ready for a busy winter season amid concerns of a surge in COVID-19 and influenza.

The Baldersgade Vaccination Centre offers vaccines against influenza, COVID-19 and, to select groups, pneumococcal disease and mpox.Whether against influenza or COVID-19, vaccines save lives, and they remain the best way to fight these diseases. WHO also encourages people to take other personal protective measures, such as cleaning hands regularly and staying away from other people when unwell with respiratory illnesses.

And even if I didn't have that opportunity, I would probably consider it because I have a lung disease,” he adds. “I've never considered a flu vaccine before because flu for me has always been kind of not dramatic, but COVID-19 has really made it apparent to me that the flu isn't that risk-free after all, and it made me reconsider [this],” concludes Michael, who contracted COVID-19 about a year ago.

Overall, she sees greater confidence in vaccination since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.“It is a bit worrying because when we had the big COVID-19 wave, we didn't have very much flu. So it’s a concern now. If both COVID-19 and flu infections increase, then it's a very bad combination, especially for the vulnerable groups,” she explains.Tina adds that the Centre’s employees have become very seasoned in administering vaccinations, and that the Centre offers in-home vaccination for vulnerable people who can’t come in person.

Video Ad Feedback Triple threat emerging: flu, Covid, RSV 02:52 - Source: CNN CNN — The United States is facing a triple threat, with a confluence of viral infections due to respiratory syncytial virus, influenza and Covid-19. Many children’s hospitals are overwhelmed after surges of RSV, while the level of influenza is the highest it has been at this point in the year for more than a decade. And after a lull in cases, new coronavirus infections are on the rise across the country as well. Young woman suffering from cold sebra/Adobe Stock Scientists finally know why people get more colds and flu in winter All of this is happening as holiday season begins, with more people traveling and gathering indoors, likely with fewer precautions than in the previous two years. How much should people be concerned? Which individuals should be the most cautious? Can people get all three viruses at the same time? What steps can be taken to reduce risk and stay safe? And should mandates such as masking and social distancing return? To guide us through these questions, I spoke with CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician, public health expert and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of “Lifelines: A Doctor’s Journey in the Fight for Public Health.” Video Ad Feedback Seasonal flu: What you need to know 01:46 - Source: CNN CNN: Why should people be concerned about the convergence of RSV, influenza and Covid-19? Dr. Leana Wen: There are several reasons to be concerned about this so-called tripledemic. One is the impact at the societal level. Already, children’s hospitals across the United States are filled with kids infected with viruses, including RSV and influenza. Some experts speculate this is due to an immunity gap as a result of mitigation measures taken over the last two years. The situation is so bad that children’s health leaders have requested a formal declaration of emergency from the Biden administration to better assist these hospitals. (The administration has not declared an emergency, but the US Department of Health and Human Services sent a letter to governors last week saying it “stands ready to continue assisting you with resources, supplies, and personnel.”) Shutterstock Hospitals are the fullest they've been throughout the pandemic — but it's not just Covid When hospitals exceed capacity, care for patients suffers. People who come to the emergency department end up waiting much longer because there isn’t enough staff to care for them. Patients who need to be hospitalized may wait for days for a bed to open up. Some patients, especially in rural areas, may need to be transferred hours away for the care they need. These delays could be harmful, even deadly. And this doesn’t just affect patients with respiratory ailments; it leads to delays in care for broken bones, asthma attacks and appendicitis, too, among other medical emergencies. Another is the consequence for particularly vulnerable individuals. While most people who contract RSV, influenza, Covid-19 and other respiratory illnesses will have mild symptoms, those most vulnerable could become severely ill, require intensive care and even die. The higher the rates of infection in their community, the more dangerous it becomes for vulnerable people. Of course, no one wants to be sick. Even a minor viral illness can cause inconvenience, such as missed work and school. And even if someone does not need to be hospitalized, they could still feel unwell and be contagious to others. So a high level of infection of these viruses is something that concerns all of us. There are two major symptoms that should prompt concern in respiratory infections — difficulty breathing and dehydration, says Dr. Leana Wen. kornnphoto/Adobe Stock Can your child's respiratory infection can be treated at home? CNN: Which people should be the most cautious during this period? Wen: Individuals who should be most cautious are those are at the highest risk for severe illness. That includes older people, newborns and people with multiple chronic medical conditions. These are people most susceptible to viruses, and what is a mild infection to someone who is a healthy young adult could result in hospitalization for them. Another group that should consider being cautious are those in direct contact with people at high risk. A spouse of someone who is immunocompromised, family members who live with elderly individuals, parents or caregivers to a newborn — these are all individuals who should reduce the risk of infection to themselves to prevent transmission to someone vulnerable in their immediate household. CNN: Can people contract all three viruses? Wen: In theory, yes. Someone can certainly, over the course of a year, contract all three viruses. Generally, though, they don’t get them all at the same time. The “tripledemic” phrase refers to all three viruses surging in the population at once, not necessarily (and not usually) in the same person simultaneously. The flu vaccine reduces your chance of severe illness — that is, of being hospitalized or dying — and can reduce your likelihood of contracting the flu at all, says Dr. Leana Wen SDI Productions/Getty Images What you should know about getting a flu vaccine this year CNN: What steps can be taken to reduce risk and stay safe? Wen: Vaccines exist for Covid-19 and for the flu to prevent severe disease and death. People should follow guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about staying up to date with their coronavirus and flu vaccine. The coronavirus is airborne. Good ventilation helps to reduce spread, so gathering with others outdoors will be safer than indoors. Indoor settings can be lower risk if there is improved ventilation, for example, through open doors and windows and the use of HEPA filters. Testing for the coronavirus remains an important tool in combating the pandemic. Lindsey Wasson/Reuters Influenza and RSV are spread primarily through droplets. People should stay away from those who are coughing and sneezing (and individuals with symptoms should avoid public settings). Everyone should wash their hands frequently — and well. That is especially important for young children who often put their hands in their mouths. There are other important tools, too, including testing and masking. Taking a Covid-19 test before gathering can reduce risk, as can wearing a high-quality N95 or equivalent mask (KN95 or KF94). CNN: Is a cloth mask or regular medical mask enough? Wen: No. The virus that causes Covid-19 is spread through microscopic droplets that can pass through cloth and regular medical masks. The N95 mask is the gold standard and will offer the best protection against respiratory viruses. There will be some people who cannot tolerate an N95. Those individuals can wear two medical masks or a cloth mask on top of a medical mask. But these options are still not as protective as a well-fitting N95 or equivalent. CNN: Should mandates like masking and social distancing return? Per new CDC guidance, everyone ages 5 and older can receive the new bivalent Covid-19 booster, as long as they have completed their primary vaccine series. Scott Olson/Getty Images Should your child receive the updated Covid-19 booster? An expert weighs in Wen: I think it will be very difficult to ask everyone to return to masking, distancing and avoiding indoor gatherings with loved ones — especially over the holidays. My view is that top-down mandates from the any level of government should be reserved for truly dire situations for which there are no other options — for example, if a new highly transmissible variant emerges that is far more dangerous and resistant to existing vaccines. That’s not the situation at the moment. That said, just because mandates across the board aren’t likely doesn’t mean that people shouldn’t take care themselves. Individuals — especially those vulnerable to severe illness and their household contacts — should choose to wear well-fitting N95s or equivalent while in crowded indoor spaces. They can choose additional protective measures, including staying outdoors or in well-ventilated spaces when possible. And everyone should make sure, again, that they are vaccinated with the vaccines that currently are available against Covid-19 and influenza.

But all indications are that this winter in the Northern Hemisphere will be different. The number of flu infections is going up, and according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the current hospitalization rate for the disease in the US is higher than it has been at this time of the year in the past decade. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections are currently also on the rise.These trends, together with the continued COVID-19 pandemic, have triggered predictions of a “tripledemic” this winter in which communities are buffeted by outbreaks of multiple respiratory viruses simultaneously. What happens if, in this pathogenic soup, more than one virus infects an individual at the same time?“People thought about this way back in the 1950s and 60s,” says Yale School of Medicine immunologist Ellen Foxman, as they observed that an initial viral infection sometimes protected against a second simultaneous infection in cell cultures. Back then, though, this couldn’t be analyzed in human populations, “because we didn’t have good tests for these viruses until about the past 10 to 15 years, when PCR became a way of testing for viruses.” All we knew is that everyone gets sick in the winter, says Foxman.See “Is COVID-19 Seasonal?”Thus, “most of what we know about virus infection, virus pathogenesis, [and] virus epidemiology is based on the one virus-one disease approach, and that’s not real,” says Pablo Murcia, a virologist at the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research. Multiple viruses cocirculate in the environment and illnesses caused by coinfections may occur—we know little about how individuals respond to them, he says. Studies on viral interactions have been rather rare, but they are slowly becoming more common.Evidence of what happens when viruses interact is gradually accumulating based on population, individual, and cellular data. In some cases, infections can compound and cause worse symptoms than each on its own. But viruses frequently negatively interact, a phenomenon known as viral interference.It is “quite important” to improve our understanding of these interactions, says Murcia, as this will help us grasp how viruses are transmitted in real life. Moreover, by unraveling the mechanisms that viruses use to interfere with other pathogens, we may find new approaches to treating patients.From populations to hosts to cellsIn the second half of the 20th century, not only did evidence of how one virus can block another begin to emerge in the lab, but certain epidemiological patterns of respiratory virus outbreaks suggested the existence of viral interference. For example, data from Norway from 1974 to 1981 showed that RSV and flu infections did not reach their epidemic peaks at the same time, and an analysis of studies conducted in the 1970s in India and Nepal found that a single adenovirus type tends to predominate in a given village, often excluding others. More recently, researchers reported that the usual seasonal epidemic of common respiratory viruses was delayed during the flu epidemic in 2009­­–2010 in Beijing and France.Most of what we know about virus infection, virus pathogenesis, [and] virus epidemiology is based on the one virus-one disease approach, and that’s not real.—Pablo Murcia, MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus ResearchWith the possibilities opened up by the use of new PCR technologies, Murcia and his colleagues analyzed 44,230 cases of respiratory illnesses in Scotland between 2005 and 2013. The analysis was based on data of patients simultaneously tested for 11 viruses—including rhinovirus, influenzas A and B, RSV, and seasonal coronaviruses. Of all the patients who tested positive for at least one virus, 11 percent of them had a coinfection—most commonly of two viruses, but some patients harbored up to five viruses at the time of sample collection.See “Plenty of Evidence for Recombination in SARS-CoV-2”The results offer a glimpse at the frequency of coinfections at the host level and add evidence of positive and negative interactions between these viruses. Specifically, statistical analyses of the prevalence of each pair of viruses at the population level revealed strong signs of positive interactions between different parainfluenza viruses, which cause respiratory infections in infants and young children, and between metapneumovirus and RSV—both also quite common in young children. In contrast, negative interactions cropped up between influenza B and adenoviruses and between rhinoviruses and influenza A virus.Infections with rhinoviruses, which are the most common culprit behind the common cold, have also been found to block flu infections in other studies, including one led by Foxman. Renee Chan, a cell biologist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and her colleagues studied this interaction at the population, individual, and cellular levels, confirming a negative interaction between the two viruses at all of them. The phenomenon needs to be studied at all these three levels in order to confirm it actually occurs, she says.One of the key mechanisms of the observed interference is a nonspecific immune response to the first virus, which puts an individual into an antiviral state that offers protection against some other would-be invaders.The innate immune system takes up armsIn recent years, the development of organoid models has shed additional light on how viral interference works. In lab experiments with respiratory viruses, “you want the tissue that’s getting infected to be as close as possible to what we have in our airway,” says Foxman. To achieve this, her team uses organoids made of stem cells induced to form human airway epithelium. “They differentiate into a tissue that looks a lot like the tissue that lines our airway,” she explains.In studies published in 2020 and 2021, Foxman and her colleagues reported that an initial infection of rhinovirus induced a strong and rapid innate immune response that prevented a subsequent infection with influenza or SARS-CoV-2 in an organoid model.See “How Some Vaccines Protect Against More than Their Targets”“The body has these specialized sensors that just sense structures that a lot of viruses have in common, and it doesn’t matter the details of which virus it is,” explains Foxman. For example, detection of viral RNA causes infected cells to secrete interferons, molecules that alert neighbors that there is a virus around. As a result, this release upregulates what are collectively known as interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) that encode antiviral proteins, she says, some of which “block the virus from entering the cells, some block viruses from leaving the cell, others will just shut off all the cellular machinery that the virus needs to reproduce.”See “Lots of Rapid Evolution in Interferon-Stimulated Genes: Study”“Many different viruses can turn on this response, and many different viruses are also prevented from growing once this response is on,” notes Foxman, who is a coinventor on patent applications for biomarkers to study the interferon response in the airway.Based on lab experiments and mathematical models, researchers have also hypothesized that direct competition may play a role, with viruses contending with one another for cells to infect, cell surface receptors, or cellular resources. Yet, within hosts, this competition may be tied up with the immune response, notes Stacey Schultz-Cherry, a virologist at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. That’s because, by replicating faster, a virus that gains an edge in the competition could extend its lead by causing the host to enter into an antiviral state that “can really limit that second virus or third virus from coming in and actually infecting in that environment.”When viral interference failsWhether a virus interferes with a second infection depends, however, on many factors—several of them related to the immune response itself: how the viruses involved trigger the interferon response and also how they respond to it, the timing of infection, and the host’s ability to produce this innate response.For instance, “vulnerable populations, whether it be pregnant women, the elderly, or people with high body mass index” often show weakened innate immune responses, says Schultz-Cherry. Thus, the question is whether these populations are more susceptible to coinfections.Any time you have expansion of the paradigm of how you understand disease pathogenesis, [this] opens up the door to interventions that you’ve never even thought of.—Ellen Foxman, Yale School of Medicine The timing of the infections also matters, most sources tell The Scientist. “Let’s say somebody had flu and it got in their lungs and they had some tissue damage” from it, says Foxman. That person may still be recovering from this damage when they get a second virus once “all the interferon effect is gone.” This would be a plausible scenario where a second infection may actually make things worse, “because the tissue isn’t in its normal healthy, resilient state.”But even within infections occurring simultaneously, “my best guess,” Foxman adds in a follow-up email, “is that interference rather than potentiation is more likely if the first infection is mild and rapidly induces a robust host innate immune response.”Given that it’s only been around for a few years, even less is known about coinfections involving SARS-CoV-2. Yet the immune hallmarks of the disease give some clues about how these play out. Deficient interferon production has been linked to an increased vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2, so researchers wonder whether patients with less interferon response are more prone to getting coinfections, or to suffering more severe disease if they do. There’s some epidemiological data and animal research pointing toward potential interactions between flu and SARS-CoV-2 that could worsen clinical outcomes. For instance, even as researchers observed that influenza-positive patients had a lower risk for acquiring SARS-CoV-2, the clinical outcome was more severe in cases where coinfection did occur than in those in which only one of the two viruses was detected. Golden Syrian hamsters coinfected with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza also had more lung damage after a coinfection compared to animals infected by either of the two viruses.However, Murcia emphasizes that so far, we don’t know much about how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with other viruses in real life. This will be the first winter in the Northern Hemisphere in which many coinfections of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses could occur, and yet, it may take “multiple seasons” of people mixing normally to actually observe clear patterns of interaction, he notes.Learning from viral interferenceWith so many open questions remaining, all sources agree on the importance of improving our understanding of viral interactions. Doctors and public health professionals need to track coinfections far more often, because the evidence indicates that they do impact how “viruses behave within the human body . . . and how severe disease you might get,” says Hana Dobrovolny, a computational biophysicist who studies viral infections at Texas Christian University. Once researchers understand better how frequent coinfections are, as well as their associated clinical outcomes, we can use that information to improve how patients infected by these viruses are treated, she says.“Any time you have expansion of the paradigm of how you understand disease pathogenesis, [this] opens up the door to interventions that you’ve never even thought of,” Foxman concurs.For instance, vaccines and antiviral drugs are important for public health, yet we have both for COVID-19 and flu and “they’re still both huge public health problems,” Foxman notes. We need additional complementary strategies that come at the problem from a different angle, she says.Based on the accumulating evidence that rhinoviruses—which sometimes do not induce any symptoms—interfere with other respiratory viruses, Chan posits that viruses causing asymptomatic infections may be key players in viral interference, adding that more efforts should be made to monitor and understand how these viruses may provide natural protection from other pathogens and what pathways they induce.Yet Foxman says it’s unlikely that viral interference will prevent us from seeing high respiratory virus circulation this winter. If anything, the phenomenon might mean that “we won’t get the peak wave of each one all at the same time,” she says, but rather “they could be staggered.”In any case, it is important to continue to take precautionary measures, including vaccination, she adds, since “you don’t need two viruses to get sick.” While the insights gleaned about viral interference are “not yet actionable,” she notes, “there are established technologies that we know can actually benefit you right now.”See “After Decades of Delays, RSV Vaccines Show Promise in Early Data”Other Interactions in the DishSome lab experiments have revealed interactions of viruses within cells with unclear relevance to the real world. For instance, a coinfection with influenza A and a human parainfluenza type favors the growth of the flu virus in vitro, an effect attributed to the cell fusion abilities of the parainfluenza virus.Early this year, Murcia also showed that human lung cells coinfected with influenza A and RSV churn out hybrid viral particles that harbor components of both parental viruses and are better at evading antibodies against flu. “Whether that happens in real life, we don’t know,” says Murcia, nor do we know whether these particles “make disease more severe or less severe.”ShareKeywordsCOVID-19fluhostimmune systemimmunologyinfectious diseaseinfluenzainnate immune systeminterferonmicrobiologyNewsnews featurepandemicrhinovirusRSVSARS-CoV-2viral surveillancevirologyvirusvirusesMeet the AuthorAlejandra Manjarrez, PhDAlejandra Manjarrez is a freelance science journalist who contributes to The Scientist.

To what extent these two etiologies differ in ICU patients remains uncertain. We, therefore, aimed at comparing the severity and outcomes of influenza and SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS in mechanically ventilated patients. Methods: This retrospective, analytic, single-center study was conducted in the medical ICU of Nancy University Hospital in France. Adult patients hospitalized with confirmed influenza (from 2009 to 2019) or SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS (between March 2020 and May 2021) and those under mechanical ventilation were included. Each patient with influenza was matched with two patients with COVID-19, with the same severity of ARDS. The primary endpoint was death in ICU on day 28. The secondary endpoints were the duration of vasopressors, the use of renal replacement therapy, the duration of mechanical ventilation, and the ICU length of stay. Results: A total of 42 patients with influenza were matched with 84 patients with COVID-19. They had similar sex distribution, age, Charlson comorbidity index, and ARDS severity. On day 28, 11 (26.2%) patients in the influenza group and nine (10.7%) patients in the COVID-19 group had died (p = 0.0084, HR = 3.31, CI 95% [1.36–8.06]). In the univariate Cox model, being infected with SARS-CoV-2, SOFA and SAPS II scores, initial arterial pH, PaCO2, PaO2/FiO2, serum lactate level, platelet count, and use of renal replacement therapy were significantly associated with mortality. In the multivariate Cox model, the SOFA score at admission (p < 0.01, HR = 1.284, CI 95% [1.081; 1.525]) and the initial pH (p < 0.01, HR = 0.618, CI 95% [0.461; 0.828]) were the only predictors of mortality. The type of virus had no influence on mortality, though patients with COVID-19 underwent longer mechanical ventilation and received more neuromuscular blockers and prone positioning. Conclusion: In mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS, 28-day mortality was higher among patients with influenza as compared to patients with COVID-19 because of a higher initial extra-pulmonary severity. However, the type of virus was not, by itself, correlated with mortality. Introduction The seasonal influenza virus is well known for causing winter epidemics and even unpredictable pandemics. By invading the lower respiratory tract, it can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and is responsible each year for admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU) with prolonged hospitalization (1, 2). The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic overwhelmed hospitals with a great number of patients presenting acute respiratory failure, with many developing ARDS (3). Nowadays, influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are the most frequent viruses causing ARDS (4). Their modes of transmission and clinical presentation are similar. They can cause acute respiratory disease, as well as extra-pulmonary disorders such as cardiac and kidney failure, and endotheliopathy (1, 5, 6). To understand the particularities of COVID-19 in critically ill patients, patients with influenza and COVID-19 have been compared in the literature. However, studies often compared COVID-19 with other multiple causes of ARDS, including viral and bacterial infections (7, 8). Other studies did not focus on critically ill patients (4, 9), and in those that did, not all the patients were under mechanical ventilation (10, 11). Indeed, studies dealing only with mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS are very scarce (12, 13). This study aimed to compare the characteristics and outcomes of mechanically ventilated ICU patients suffering from influenza or SARS-CoV-2 ARDS of similar pulmonary severity to untangle the influence of the virus type by itself. Methods Study design and setting We conducted a retrospective, single-center, and analytical matched cohort study in the ICU, Réanimation Médicale, Hôpital Central of the Nancy Regional and University Hospital Center in France. The study was registered on www.clinicaltrials.gov under the number NCT04941092 and was approved by the Ethics Committee of our University Hospital. Participants The electronic medical database of the hospital was searched for patients hospitalized in our ICU between 2009 and 2019 with the main diagnosis containing “influenza,” and between March 2020 and May 2021 with the main diagnosis containing “COVID-19” or “SARS-CoV-2.” Inclusion criteria were participants older than 18 years, a diagnosis of ARDS according to the Berlin definition criteria (14), influenza or SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and the use of invasive mechanical ventilation. Exclusion criteria were pregnancy, the use of invasive mechanical ventilation for more than 48 h before admission into the ICU, or a secondary transfer to another ICU. Each patient with influenza was matched with two patients with COVID-19, based on the severity of ARDS: severe ARDS or mild to moderate ARDS. Endpoints The primary endpoint was mortality in the ICU within 28 days. The secondary endpoints were the duration of vasopressors, the use of renal replacement therapy, the duration of mechanical ventilation, the length of stay in the ICU, and the duration and amount of sedation. Data collection Data were collected from the patient's medical records and anonymized. Data included baseline demographic characteristics, such as age, sex, height, and weight, patient's past medical history, laboratory findings, and clinico-biological parameters: simplified acute physiology score (SAPS II) and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, the worst ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2), highest positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) level within the first 24 h of mechanical ventilation, complete blood cells count, blood chemistry, serum lactate concentration, duration of mechanical ventilation, number of prone positioning sessions, use and duration of catecholamines, renal replacement therapy, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), antibiotics, corticosteroids, neuromuscular blockers, and duration and quantity of midazolam, sufentanil, propofol, dexmedetomidine, and chlorpromazine. Statistical methods Descriptive and comparative analyses Baseline characteristics were described as counts and percentages for categorical variables and as median and interquartile ranges for continuous variables. The distribution of the baseline parameters was compared between the two groups of infected patients using an exact chi-square test, exact Fisher test, or Wilcoxon test, according to the type of variable and statistical conditions appliance. The Fisher and chi-square tests were used for qualitative variables. The Fisher test was used in default of the chi-square test when the statistical conditions were not verified. The Wilcoxon test was used for continuous variables as they did not follow a Gaussian distribution. Survival analysis Patients discharged from the ICU before day 28 were censored at the time of discharge. Associations between each parameter of interest and overall survival measured during the 28 days after ICU admission were assessed by univariate Cox models on paired series. Then, correlations between variables with a p-value of <0.05 were estimated by a Pearson coefficient or a Phi coefficient, according to the type of variable. In case of high correlation (r or Phi > 0.75) between variables, a choice was made based on the clinical relevance of the variables of interest. A multivariate Cox model on paired series was then built to assess the association between virus type and mortality within 28 days of ICU admission adjusted for the selected factors. If several models were built, the selection of the final model was made based on the Akaike criterion [the best model being the one with the lowest AIC (Akaike information criterion)]. These analyses were completed by Kaplan–Meier overall survival curves compared using a log-rank test. We estimated the hazard ratios with a confidence interval of 95% and fixed the alpha's risk threshold to 5%. The analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Results Characteristics of the patients Among 43 patients with influenza and 113 patients with COVID-19 who met the inclusion criteria, 42 patients with influenza were matched with 84 patients with COVID-19 (Figure 1). A total of 30 influenza patients with severe ARDS were matched with 60 COVID-19 patients with severe ARDS. Notably, 12 influenza patients with mild to moderate ARDS were matched with 24 COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate ARDS (three patients with influenza having mild ARDS were matched with one patient with COVID-19 having mild ARDS and one patient with COVID-19 having moderate ARDS, respectively, as there were not enough mild COVID-19 ARDS). No significant differences were observed for sex, age, and Charlson comorbidity index (Table 1). There were more hematologic malignancies in the influenza group (5 vs. 1). Compared to the patients with COVID-19, patients with influenza had significantly higher median SOFA and SAPS II scores, a lower initial median arterial pH, a higher initial median PaCO2, a higher median serum lactate level, a lower median platelet count, and a higher median serum creatinine level at admission (Table 1). All patients underwent mechanical ventilation. FIGURE 1 Figure 1. Flow chart. TABLE 1 Table 1. Baseline characteristics. ICU therapies As shown in Table 2, patients with COVID-19 underwent significantly longer median mechanical ventilation with higher initial PEEP levels, received neuromuscular blockers more often, and underwent prone positioning more often during their ICU stay than patients with influenza. There was no statistical difference between the proportion of patients in each group receiving vasopressors, although patients with COVID-19 received vasopressors for a longer time than patients with influenza. Patients with influenza had a trend of receiving more renal replacement therapy than patients with COVID-19, without statistical significance (28.6 vs. 14.3%, p = 0.07). When comparing sedative agents, patients with COVID-19 received midazolam and sufentanil much longer, with higher doses of midazolam. Two patients with influenza were placed under ECMO, but none were in the COVID-19 group. TABLE 2 Table 2. ICU therapies and outcome. Association between the type of virus and survival On day 28, 11 (26.2%) patients in the influenza group and nine (10.7%) patients in the COVID-19 group had died (HR = 3.31, CI 95% [1.36–8.06], p = 0.0084). Figure 2 shows the Kaplan–Meier curve of the probability of survival from ICU admission to day 28, with a significantly higher probability of survival in the COVID-19 group (p = 0.005). Overall, death in ICU was 31% in the influenza group vs. 19% in the COVID-19 group (p = 0.09). FIGURE 2 Figure 2. Probability of survival (Kaplan-Meyer curves). The results of univariate Cox models are shown in Table 3. Being infected with influenza, the SOFA and SAPS II scores, initial arterial pH, PaO2/FiO2, PaCO2, serum lactate concentration, platelet count, and use of renal replacement therapy were significantly associated with mortality. TABLE 3 Table 3. Predictive factors of mortality (univariate Cox models results). The analysis of correlation matrices between the variables of interest with a p-value of <0.05 in the univariate model and clinical reasoning led to the construction of two multivariate Cox models. Model 1 (Table 4) includes the type of virus, arterial pH, and SOFA score (AIC = 157.7); and model 2 (Table 5) includes the type of virus, arterial pH, and SAPS II score (AIC = 163.9). The first model including SOFA score and pH value showed to be the most parsimonious. The type of virus had no independent effect on mortality. TABLE 4 Table 4. Predictive factors of mortality (multivariate Cox model) – SOFA score considered. TABLE 5 Table 5. Predictive factors of mortality (multivariate Cox model) – SAPS II score considered. Discussion This analytic retrospective study comparing 42 influenza and 84 COVID-19 mechanically ventilated patients, matched by the severity of ARDS, found that influenza patients had higher 28-day mortality (26.2 vs. 10.7%) (p < 0.05). However, multivariate Cox analysis revealed that the type of virus by itself did not affect mortality: SOFA score and initial arterial pH were the only independent predictors of outcome. When not considering the early studies reporting very high mortality rates that were not confirmed afterward, the mortality of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 in ICU varies between 24 and 43% (3, 15–18), with an important heterogeneity between cohorts (19, 20). The mortality of our patients with COVID-19 is lower despite similar demographics and severity than in other studies. In contrast, the 26.2% mortality rate of our patients with influenza is more consistent with the literature, as reported mortality rates in mechanically ventilated influenza patients with ARDS range between 26 and 45% (21–24). There are no arguments in the literature for a difference in the outcome, length of hospitalization, or mechanical ventilation among the different strains of influenza (25). Studies comparing influenza and SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS are scarce. Gjurašin et al. (12) described 42 influenza and 30 COVID-19 intubated patients in a Croatian center with mortality rates of 55 and 63%, respectively. For comparison, the overall ICU mortality in our study was 31% in patients with influenza and 19% in patients with COVID-19. Cobb et al. (10) described 74 patients with influenza and 65 patients with COVID-19 in the medical ICUs of two Washington hospitals, but less than 60% of them were intubated. Furthermore, there were more ARDS cases in their COVID-19 group than in their influenza group, which makes it difficult to compare those patients with ours. Hospital mortality in their ARDS patients was 37% in the influenza group and 46% in the COVID-19 group. Tang et al. (11) described 75 H1N1-induced ARDS from Wuhan and 73 COVID-19-induced ARDS from Beijing. In-hospital mortality was 34.7% among patients with influenza and 28.8% among patients with COVID-19. Here again, the groups had different respiratory severity (PaO2/FiO2 of 107 and 85.8% of mechanically ventilated patients in the influenza group, and 199 and 19.2% in the COVID-19 group). Cárdenas et al. (13), in a single-center study from Mexico, compared 94 influenza and 147 COVID-19 intubated patients with ARDS. Although their patients with influenza had more shock at admission, were more hypoxemic, and had a higher SOFA score, their crude ICU mortality was lower than that of the patients with COVID-19 (22 vs. 39%), which contrasted with our results. Piroth et al. (4) described the characteristics of more than 100000 hospitalized inflluenza and COVID-19 patients, using a large nationwide french database. Among them, 14% were admitted to the ICU. Their in-hospital mortality among mechanically ventilated patients was 26% in the influenza group, and 31.8% in the COVID-19 group. Finally, Ludwig et al. (9) described a German database of 6,762 patients with influenza and 2,343 patients with COVID-19, with 15% admitted to the ICU. Their mortality rate in mechanically ventilated patients was 36% in patients with influenza and 47% in patients with COVID-19. However, only 54% of ventilated patients with COVID-19 and 14% of ventilated patients with influenza had ARDS. It is, therefore, difficult to discuss and compare the mortality of these studies with ours, as they were not all focusing on critically ill patients and described patients with different respiratory severity. Of note, all these studies included patients with COVID-19 at the beginning of the pandemic, with only one study extending to October 2020 (13). The difference in mortality between patients with influenza and COVID-19 observed in our study seems to be explained by the increased initial severity of patients with influenza, as witnessed by significantly higher SOFA and SAPS II scores at admission. As the patients were matched by the severity of ARDS, the difference in these scores is mainly due to a difference in extra-pulmonary severity. However, patients with influenza had an initial higher PaCO2 level, with lower pH, which could reflect impaired pulmonary compliance. Unfortunately, compliance could not be calculated in our study. Furthermore, significantly lower pH in the first 24 h could be explained by metabolic acidosis due to initial hemodynamic and renal failure. Botta et al. (18) showed a significant association between initial pH and 28-day mortality in their patients with COVID-19. In our study, patients with influenza had more acute kidney injury (AKI) with a higher serum creatinine level at admission, and a trend toward a more frequent use of renal replacement therapy (RRT) (28 vs. 14%) during the ICU stay, though without statistically significant difference. AKI is a well-described complication of COVID-19 (26) and influenza (27), especially in critically ill patients, and is a major risk factor for mortality. In the previously cited studies, AKI in patients with COVID-19 varies between 18 and 58%, with a need for RRT between 11 and 28% (3, 9–12, 16, 18, 19), and is associated with the highest mortality if occurring within the first 15 days (3). AKI in patients with influenza varies between 11 and 59% (9, 12, 22, 25). In our study, patients with influenza had significantly higher lactate levels on admission and a lower platelet count, which could reflect the initial severity of the shock. By contrast, patients with COVID-19 received vasopressors significantly longer, but this was probably the consequence of a need for longer mechanical ventilation and an increased amount of sedative agents, due to secondary respiratory worsening, rather than primary hemodynamic failure. Thus, it could be hypothesized that for an equal severity of ARDS, a greater proportion of patients with influenza has multi-organ failure at admission into the ICU. Indeed, our multivariate model shows that initial arterial pH and SOFA score are independent predictors of mortality in our patients. For example, each decrease of 0.1 points in the initial arterial pH increases the risk of mortality by 61%. In this model, there was no statistical association between the type of virus and mortality, meaning that having influenza or SARS-CoV-2 is not, by itself, a risk factor for mortality. In other words, there would be no difference in terms of mortality between patients with influenza and COVID-19, if their initial severity was similar. Finally, patients with COVID-19 underwent longer mechanical ventilation, with higher initial PEEP levels, and received more neuromuscular blockers and prone position, which is consistent with the literature (8–10, 12). Regarding the use of sedative agents, patients with COVID-19 received midazolam longer and at a higher dose, as previously reported (28, 29). Possible explanations are that COVID-19 had a high respiratory drive and tachyphylaxis due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, challenges in entering patients' rooms due to isolation precautions and fear of self-extubation could lead to higher sedation (29). Our work has several limitations. First, it is a retrospective, single-center study possibly dampening its external validity. Second, the data of patients with influenza were recorded for a period of 10 years, whereas those of patients with COVID-19 were recorded over 1 year, leading to a comparison of different periods with possible different medical practices. Third, sample sizes were small, leading to a possible misinterpretation of the results. However, to our knowledge, our study is the first to compare critically ill patients with influenza and COVID-19 matched by the severity of respiratory failure. All our patients had ARDS and underwent mechanical ventilation in the same center, making their outcomes comparable, and the results of our study pertinent. Conclusion This study compared mechanically ventilated patients with influenza and COVID-19 admitted to the ICU and matched by the severity of ARDS and found that the mortality was higher among patients with influenza, due to higher extra-pulmonary severity. However, the virus type, by itself, influenza or SARS-CoV-2, was not predictive of mortality.

Keren is trained as a physician, researcher, and epidemiologist and has served as a disease detective at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.This flu season’s ferocious start has given way to record-shattering levels of transmission — and massive strains on the American health system.In the week ending November 26, more than 34,000 positive flu tests were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from labs around the US, as shown in the orange line on the chart below. That’s more positive flu tests than have been reported in any single week during any flu season on record, going back as far as 1997. The trajectory dwarfs the past six flu seasons, including the relatively bad 2019-2020 one that immediately preceded the start of the Covid-19 pandemic (shown in the black line).Keren Landman and Rani MollaSome portion of this steep rise in cases is related to the fact that more people are being tested for the flu than in previous years. Over the month of November, about twice as many flu tests were done at clinical labs nationwide as during the same period last year (about 540,000 versus 265,000). More testing means more cases will get picked up.However, there are corroborating warning signs that this is truly a bad season. Flu hospitalizations have been off the charts and are rising quickly. In a press conference Monday, CDC director Rochelle Walensky said there have already been 78,000 flu hospitalizations this season, or nearly 17 out of every 100,000 Americans. That’s “the highest we’ve seen at this time of year in a decade,” she said. In keeping with past trends, the highest hospitalization rates are among adults 65 and older. Keren Landman and Rani MollaWhat’s making these high hospitalization rates particularly concerning is their overlap with surges in other viruses causing many people to get sick enough to require admission. One of those is RSV, which has been packing pediatric hospitals for more than six weeks. And while Walensky noted there were signals RSV transmission was slowing in parts of the country, Covid-19 hospitalizations recently began to tick upward. An important reason for the convergence of these viral waves: low population-wide levels of antibodies against many common colds and the flu. Pandemic-era preventive measures delayed first-time infections among many children — which, while good for individual children’s health, meant a higher number than usual were susceptible to severe infection when those preventive measures were lifted. (More on the concept of “immunity debt” and how it can be dangerously misinterpreted here.)We can still flatten the flu season curveAmericans are also not doing everything they can to protect themselves from respiratory viruses: only a quarter of adults and 40 percent of children have received a flu shot this season, and 15 percent of adults eligible for an updated Covid-19 booster dose have received one. That represents important lost opportunities for prevention: This year’s flu shot is expected to be a particularly effective one, noted Walensky, as it is a good match to the circulating strains of the flu, which vary year to year. However, it only works if people get it.Additionally, many of the preventive measures proven effective during the Covid-19 pandemic are going broadly unused, even though they would also be helpful in preventing the spread of other respiratory illnesses. There has been no great push to implement a high standard of ventilation and filtration inside US buildings. Only one-quarter of Americans have changed their behavior to reduce viral exposure. And a minority of Americans frequently wear masks outside their homes.Amid the flu surge, medication shortages are complicating efforts to prevent severe disease and treat bacterial infections that can follow in the wake of some flu infections. Additionally, staffing shortages that intensified as a consequence of the pandemic have put pediatric hospitals in the position of caring for a massive wave of sick children with even fewer resources than they had before. Although pediatric health care organizations called for a national emergency declaration to support their response to this surge, none has been forthcoming.In the US, flu infections normally peak between December and February. It remains to be seen whether the current early flu surge will translate to an early flu peak — or instead foretells a protracted period of extraordinarily high viral transmission, with increasingly crushing burdens on health care workers as more people get severely ill. After a punishing few years, it’s not clear how much more strain the American health care system can absorb.You’ve read 1 article in the last monthHere at Vox, we're unwavering in our commitment to covering the issues that matter most to you — threats to democracy, immigration, reproductive rights, the environment, and the rising polarization across this country.Our mission is to provide clear, accessible journalism that empowers you to stay informed and engaged in shaping our world.

Photo by Tim Graham via Getty Images As Americans navigate the worst flu season in more than a decade, dogs across the country are facing flu outbreaks and symptoms like cough, fever and runny nose as well. Known as “canine influenza,” or dog flu, the highly contagious virus is airborne and can spread through direct contact, nasal discharge through barking or coughing and contaminated surfaces like kennels and leashes, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. Though the virus, which doesn't infect humans, can spread year-round, a surge in cases has occured recently—specifically with a strain of the flu known as H3N2. Veterinarians suggest the nationwide uptick is due to changes in people’s behaviors with Covid-19 restrictions being relaxed, reports the New York Times’ Emily Anthes. Dog shelters that were previously vacant during the pandemic are now full. As more people travel and return to in-person work, dogs are spending more time together in kennels and daycare centers, which allows the canine influenza to spread easier. Increased holiday travel may also increase the surge in cases among pets, reports Maia Belay for Fox 8. “One dog walks into a kennel and all the dogs walk out of the kennel with [dog flu],” Earle Rogoff, a veterinarian and owner of Orange Village Animal Hospital in Ohio, tells Fox 8. “If you’ve had your dog in a kennel or dog park or grooming with other dogs and three to five days later they start coughing, they get lethargic, show respiratory signs, then you definitely want to have them checked by a veterinarian.” As a result of the spike in cases, veterinarians have taken to social media to warn people about the virus. Daycare centers for dogs have closed and some shelters have paused adoptions, per The New York Times. Operation Kindness, a dog shelter in Texas, halted adoptions after it saw 86 percent of the dogs at the center get infected mid-last month, according to the publication. Lisa Lippman, director of virtual medicine at New York City's Bond Vet, tells USA TODAY’s Anna Kaufman that the main symptoms of canine influenza are coughing and sneezing, but other symptoms include fever, lethargy, eye secretions and lack of appetite. Though the canine influenza doesn’t progress to severe illness in most dogs, some cases can be fatal and the virus can develop into pneumonia, reports WCNC Charlotte’s Chloe Leshner. Jill Pascarella, an emergency doctor at CARE animal hospital in North Carolina, tells WCNC Charlotte that the hospital is seeing multiple cases of the virus with some dogs being hospitalized and having to rely on oxygen to breathe. “Typically, the respiratory viruses that we’d see would be a pretty self-limiting cough, more like a cold, and would just get better on its own and now we’re seeing it progress to pretty severe pneumonia in dogs,” Pascarella tells the publication. “The ones that need to come to the ER are the dogs who are not eating, are very lethargic, any respiratory distress.” Most dogs that contract the virus typically recover in two to three weeks through care from their owners as well as antimicrobial treatments prescribed by veterinarians, reports USA TODAY. Dogs infected with canine influenza are most contagious throughout the two-to-four-day virus incubation period, and almost all dogs exposed will get sick, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. To reduce the spread of the virus, dogs showing cold or flu-like symptoms, as well as dogs exposed to known infected dogs, should be isolated. Vaccines are available for the canine influenza, and experts are encouraging owners with dogs that have increased contact with other dogs to consider vaccination. Though the vaccine isn’t 100 percent effective, it can prevent dogs from contracting the virus and has the capacity to make the illness less severe, Lippman tells USA TODAY. “If you have questions, call your veterinarian,” Rogoff tells Fox 8. “Dr. Google isn’t always accurate, and your veterinarian would be able to give you the best advice because they know you and they know your pet.” Get the latest stories in your inbox every weekday.

The identification and characterization of human broadly neutralizing antibodies can facilitate the development of antibody drugs and the design of universal influenza vaccines. Here, we present structural information for the human antibody PN-SIA28’s heterosubtypic binding of hemagglutinin (HA) from circulating and emerging potential influenza A viruses (IAVs). Aside from group 1 and 2 conventional IAV HAs, PN-SIA28 also inhibits membrane fusion mediated by bat-origin H17 and H18 HAs. Crystallographic analyses of Fab alone or in complex with H1, H14, and H18 HA proteins reveal that PN-SIA28 binds to a highly conserved epitope in the fusion domain of different HAs, with the same CDRHs but different CDRLs for different HAs tested, distinguishing it from other structurally characterized anti-stem antibodies. The binding characteristics of PN-SIA28 provides information to support the design of increasingly potent engineered antibodies, antiviral drugs, and/or universal influenza vaccines.

Annual epidemics cause substantial morbidity and mortality, with 3–5 million cases of severe illness and 0.25–0.5 million deaths globally, and periodic influenza pandemics have the potential to kill millions1,2,3. Five influenza pandemics (1918 Spanish, 1957 Asian, 1968 Hong Kong, 1977 Russian, and 2009 swine flu) killed more than 40 million people since the beginning of the last century4. Furthermore, because of substantial influenza reservoirs in swine and avian populations5, the danger of a pandemic strain developing is always a concern. Several avian IAVs, including H7N96, H7N47, H5N18, H5N69, H5N810,11, and H10N312 have recently caused sporadic human infections.In addition, the host species of IAVs have expanded to bats since the identification of H17N10 and H18N11 from bat samples13,14. Despite having similar genomes and being near to IAVs, both H17N10 and H18N11 viruses differ from known H1–H16 IAVs in a number of ways, including virus cultivation and replication, the cellular receptors exploited, and neuraminidase (NA) functions13,14,15. Their zoonotic potential remains unknown because they can use human MHC II molecules as an entry mediator16,17.The current strategy to prevent influenza virus infection mainly relies on vaccination. However, due to the rapid evolution of influenza viruses, strain-specific vaccines that elicit antibodies (Abs) that neutralize vaccine strains and other homologous strains must be updated almost annually based on World Health Organization (WHO) surveillance and prediction of the strains likely to circulate in the coming year18,19. Thus, the inappropriate prediction of circulating strains can render the vaccine less effective. Antiviral drugs are another alternative for the treatment of influenza, especially in the very early stages of infection. Most notable are NA inhibitors that prevent the release of nascent virions20,21. Unfortunately, the widespread use of these drugs has resulted in the emergence of resistant viral strains without loss of transmissibility22. Given the emergence of the lack of cross-protective vaccines and anti-viral drug tolerance, there is an urgent need for the development of more effective antiviral drugs and therapeutic monoclonal Abs (mAbs) that can provide broad protective activities to prevent and treat influenza23.Most Abs induced by vaccination or infection mainly target the hemagglutinin (HA) protein. The globular HA head domain recognizes host proteins bearing sialic acid on their surface, while the HA stem triggers the fusion of viral and host membranes following endocytosis, allowing release of viral contents into the cell24. Compared to the head domain, the stem region is less prone to mutations and relatively conserved across divergent influenza subtypes25. Anti-stem antibodies exhibit much broader cross-subtype neutralizing activity in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting the low pH-induced HA conformational rearrangement, hence blocking membrane fusion24. The majority of the known heterosubtypic stem binding antibodies neutralize IAV group 1 (H1, H2, H5, H6, H8, H9, H11, H12, H13, H16, H17, and H18)26,27,28,29 or group 2 (H3, H4, H7, H10, H14, and H15)30,31,32,33,34 subtypes. In general, anti-stem antibodies capable of recognizing both group 1 and 2 IAVs are extremely rare35,36,37,38,39. Such broadly neutralizing Abs hold great promise as potential broad-spectrum prophylactic or therapeutic agents and for the design of a universal influenza vaccine.We previously reported a VH3-30-encoded mAb isolated from a patient exposed to circulating influenza A strains, with a detectable serum neutralizing activity against a 1934 influenza A isolate40. The mAb, named PN-SIA28, targets the HA stem region and neutralizes influenza A H1N1, H2N2, H5N1, and H9N2, as well as all H3N2 viruses from 1968 to 1975, in vitro41. In addition, PN-SIA28 can protect mice against A/WSN/33 (H1N1), A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2), or A/Quebec/144147/09 (H1N1) pdm09-like viruses in vivo42.In this work, we demonstrate that PN-SIA28 exhibits broader neutralizing activity in vitro and protects mice against H5N6 viruses in vivo. Besides group 1 and 2 conventional IAV HAs, PN-SIA28 can also inhibit bat H17 and H18 HA-mediated membrane fusion induced by low pH. Crystallographic analysis of Fab alone or in complex with H1, H14, and H18 HA proteins reveal that PN-SIA28 binds a highly conserved epitope in different HA stem regions with a unique binding modality. Our structural and biological data suggest the value of PN-SIA28 in treatment and vaccine development against IAVs.ResultsPN-SIA28 neutralizes divergent HA subtypesWe previously identified a human mAb named PN-SIA28 from memory B cells isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of a 55-year-old patient exposed to pre-2009 H1N1-pandemic influenza A strains, with a detectable serum-neutralizing activity against a 1934 influenza A isolate40. This mAb targets the conserved stem region of HA and has a broad neutralizing activity against several subtypes of IAVs40. PN-SIA28 had a large number of somatic mutations in both VH3-30*01 and VK1-12*01 genes compared to the unmutated common ancestor, and has a long heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (CDRH3) (16 amino acids) (Supplementary Fig. 1). Preliminary neutralization assays show that PN-SIA28 neutralizes influenza A H1N1, H2N2, H5N1, and H9N2, as well as all H3N2 viruses from 1968 to 1975, in vitro41. However, we hypothesized that PN-SIA28 might have neutralizing activity against other IAV strains. To verify the cross-reactive breadth of PN-SIA28, we measured the binding of PN-SIA28 to a panel of recombinant HAs from both group 1 and group 2 IAVs by gel filtration chromatography. We found that PN-SIA28 bound 12 IAV subtypes (H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, H8, H9, H11, H14, H17, and H18) out of the 18 HAs tested (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 2). Bio-layer interferometry (BLI) was then used to measure PN-SIA28’s affinity for all HA subtypes (H1-H18), and the results were generally consistent with gel filtration results (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 3). PN-SIA28 cross-reacted with all 18 subtype HAs, with high affinities (KD < 1 μM) to 12 HA subtypes. To further confirm the neutralization capability of PN-SIA28, divergent IAV strains were evaluated using an in vitro microneutralization assay. Consistent with the binding assays, PN-SIA28 neutralized H4N6, H6N1, and H14N6 strains with IC50s of 0.5-3 μg/ml. Additionally, PN-SIA28 also effectively neutralized two highly pathogenic avian influenza strains, H5N1 and H5N6, with IC50s of 1.0-1.5 μg/ml (Fig. 1a). These results suggest that PN-SIA28 has broad neutralizing activity against divergent group 1 and group 2 IAV strains.Fig. 1: Broad reactivity and potent protective effect of PN-SIA28.a Binding and neutralizing activity of PN-SIA28.

In this work, we chose A/Shenzhen/TH002/2016 (H5N6) IAV for prophylactic and therapeutic assays in the BALB/c mouse challenge model. A/Shenzhen/TH002/2016 (H5N6) is a highly pathogenic strain that caused sporadic human infections in China43. In the prophylaxis assay, the mice were first given different doses of PN-SIA28 (30, 10, 5, or 1 mg/kg) and then challenged with a lethal dose of H5N6 virus 24 h later. Mice (100%) receiving PN-SIA28 at a high dose (≥5 mg/kg) survived challenge with A/Shenzhen/TH002/2016 (H5N6), and all displayed increases in body weight over 2 weeks (Fig. 1b). Only 80% of mice that received PN-SIA28 at a low dose (1 mg/kg) survived (Fig. 1b). In the therapeutic assay, the mice were first challenged with a lethal dose of the H5N6 virus and then treated with a fixed dose of PN-SIA28 (15 mg/kg) on different days (0, 1, 2, or 3 days). Surprisingly, 100% of the mice treated with 15 mg/kg of PN-SIA28, even up to 3 days after infection, were protected (Fig. 1c). Altogether, the results of prophylactic and therapeutic experiments indicate that PN-SIA28 effectively protected mice against the H5N6 virus.PN-SIA28 mechanisms of antiviral activityThe cross-subtype neutralizing antibodies reported to date that target the stem region of HA function mainly function by inhibiting HA-mediated membrane fusion activity in vitro31,35,39,44,45. The cleavage of the precursor of HA (HA0), and exposure of the cleaved HA to the low pH of endosomes initiate membrane fusion. Upon exposure to low pH, the structure of HA2 undergoes extensive conformational rearrangements, transforming from the pre-fusion state to the post-fusion state and bringing the viral membrane and the target endosomal membrane into close proximity to trigger membrane fusion24,46,47,48. Thus, PN-SIA28 is poised to inhibit these processes, which is illustrated by blocking HA0 maturation to HA and by decreased protease sensitivity of HA at low pH in the presence of PN-SIA28. In assays for these processes, we demonstrated that PN-SIA28 inhibits the host cell protease cleavage of both group 1 HA (H1 and H5) and group 2 HA (H3 and H14) HA0 molecules, which would prevent membrane fusion (Fig. 2a). Further, binding of PN-SIA28 to the cleaved HA (H1, H5, H3, or H14) also prevented its low pH-induced conformational change from the pre-fusion state to the post-fusion state (Fig. 2b). Notably, binding of PN-SIA28 to bat H17 and H18 HAs also prevented their low pH-induced conformational change, indicating the potential neutralizing activity of this mAb against bat H17N10 and H18N11 viruses. Like PN-SIA28, CR9114 and FI6v3 also prevented the low pH-induced conformational change of H17 and H18 HAs, but 39.29 and MEDI8852 did not have the same inhibitory effect on bat HAs, implying the distinct efficiencies for different antibodies (Fig. 2b).Fig. 2: PN-SIA28 blocks proteolytic activation and inhibits low pH-induced conformational change in HA.a SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis results of uncleaved (HA0), recombinant-soluble H1, H5, H3, or H14 HA after digestion with trypsin at pH 8.0 for 0, 10, 20, 40, 60, 90, or 120 min. Digest reactions of HA with or without PN-SIA28 were stopped at several time points by adding a loading buffer containing SDS and dithiothreitol. H10 and trypsin-treated PN-SIA28 served as the experimental control and negative control, respectively. Data represent a representative experiment from two independent experiments. b, SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis results of the protease-susceptibility assay for HAs. Exposure of HA to low pH converts the HA to the protease-susceptible, post-fusion state (lane 3). Treatment of HA with PN-SIA28 before low-pH treatment blocks the pH-induced conformational change, retaining HAs (H1, H5, H3, H14, H17, and H18) in the protease-resistant, prefusion state (lane 7). Treatment of HA with CR9114 and FI6v3 before low-pH treatment blocks the pH-induced conformational change, retaining HAs (H17 and H18) in the protease-resistant, prefusion state (lane 7). In contrast, the pH-induced conformational change of H17 and H18 could not be blocked by treatment of HA with 39.29 or MEDI8852 prior to low-pH treatment. Data represent a representative experiment from two independent experiments.

We determined the structures of the PN-SIA28 Fab fragment alone at 2.5 Å and of its Fab variable fragment complexes with H1, H14, or H18 HA at 3.2, 3.4, and 2.6 Å resolution, respectively (Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 4). In our structures, we found that each Fab variable fragment interacts with just one protomer of the HA trimer, and PN-SIA28 recognized conserved residues in the stem region of HA by binding in a very similar orientation to the HAs. Overall, PN-SIA28 uses both its heavy and light chains to contact HA and bury approximately 1750, 1680, and 1646 Å2 from solvent for the H1, H14, and H18 complexes, respectively. The heavy chain of PN-SIA28 binds to the fusion subdomain of HA largely through an extended hydrophobic CDRH3 loop that inserts into a shallow hydrophobic groove between helix A of HA2 and the fusion domain component of HA1, whereas the light chain mainly interacts with the N-terminal region of helix A of HA2 (Figs. 3, 4). The epitope residues contacted by the PN-SIA28 heavy chain and light chain are quite similar between these three subtypes (Fig. 3b, e, h and Fig. 4). The heavy-chain paratopes or antigen-binding sites of PN-SIA28 in the HA complexes are remarkably similar, whereas the light-chain paratopes or antigen-binding site responsible for HA binding are obviously different (Fig. 3c, f, i). The heavy chain paratopes of PN-SIA28 in the PN-SIA28/H1, PN-SIA28/H14, and PN-SIA28/H18 complexes are composed of large portions of CDRH2 and CDRH3, whereas the light chain paratope of PN-SIA28 in the PN-SIA28/H1 complex is composed of large portions of CDRL1. The light chain paratope of PN-SIA28 in the PN-SIA28/H14 complex is composed of large portions of CDRL1 and CDRL2, while the light chain paratope of PN-SIA28 in the PN-SIA28/H18 complex is composed of large portions of CDRL1 and CDRL3 (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 2a–c).Fig. 3: Structures of the PN-SIA28/H1, PN-SIA28/H14, and PN-SIA28/H18 complexes.The overall structures of the PN-SIA28/H1 (a), PN-SIA28/H14 (d), and PN-SIA28/H18 (g) complexes are displayed in cartoon representation. The PN-SIA28 Ab binds the conserved stem regions of the H1, H14, and H18 HAs. The epitope residues of PN-SIA28 in HA1 and HA2 of H1 (b), H14 (e), and H18 (h) are denoted in black and white characters, respectively. Residues of HA that are in contact with the heavy chain of PN-SIA28 are colored magenta, residues that are in contact with the light chain of PN-SIA28 are colored yellow, and residues that are in contact with both chains of PN-SIA28 are colored blue (b, e, h). The residues of PN-SIA28 responsible for the HA binding in the PN-SIA28/HA complexes (c, f, i) are marked in white characters. The heavy chain is colored magenta, and the light chain is colored yellow. The residues contacting the HA are colored orange for the heavy chain and colored pink for the light chain (c, f, i).Full size imageFig. 4: PN-SIA28 binds to different HA proteins with a unique binding modality.a-b PN-SIA28 interactions with HA1 of H1, H14, and H18. (a) Overlay of PN-SIA28 bound to group 1 (H1) and group 2 (H14) HA proteins. HA1 and HA2 of H1 are colored green and cyan, and HA1 and HA2 of H14 are colored split pea and pale cyan, respectively. The CDRH3 of PN-SIA28 binding to H1 is colored magenta, and the CDRH3 of PN-SIA28 binding to H14 is colored hot pink. (b) Overlay of PN-SIA28 bound to group 1 (H1) and group 2 (H18) HA proteins.

The CDRH3 of PN-SIA28 binding to H18 is colored light pink. The key amino acids that are in contact with the CDRH3 of PN-SIA28 are shown in stick representation. c–e, PN-SIA28 interactions with HA2 of H1 (c), H14 (d), and H18 (e). The main CDR loops of PN-SIA28 that are in contact with HA are shown in cartoon representation, and the heavy chain and light chain of PN-SIA28 are colored magenta and yellow. HAs are shown in surface and cartoon representation. Only the HA residues that form hydrogen bonds with PN-SIA28 are labeled and shown in stick representation. Polar contacts are drawn as dashed lines.Full size imageFor the interaction between the heavy chain of PN-SIA28 and H1, CDRH3 makes extensive contacts with the bottom of a hydrophobic groove that is formed by residues H18, N20, H38, V40, K280, and T315 (all residues are in H3 numbering) from the fusion domain component of HA1, G16, I18, D19, G20, and W21 of the fusion peptide, and Q38, Q42, I45, D48, and R49 of helix A (Fig. 2b, c and Supplementary Table 2a).Among these resides, F99 (CDRH3) (Kabat numbering) binds in a upper position, and I100A (CDRH3) binds in a lower position, in the nonpolar groove. Y52A (CDRH2) also makes hydrophobic contacts with residues I18 and D19 of the fusion peptide. Additionally, Y56 (CDRH2) interacts with residues Y34 and A35 located at the bottom of helix A, as well as with residue E150 of helix G (Fig. 3b, c and Supplementary Table 2a). In particular, Y52A (CDRH2) makes a hydrogen bond with G16 of the fusion peptide, and Y56 (CDRH2) makes a hydrogen bond with K153 (Fig. 4c).For the interaction between the light chain of PN-SIA28 and H1, CDRL2 and CDRL3 form minor interactions with H1, and the CDRL2 loop contacts residues from helix A of HA2 on the fusion subdomain. S31 (CDRL1) interacts with residue D46 of helix A, and W32 (CDRL1) makes hydrophobic contacts with residues Q42, I45, and R49 of helix A (Fig. 3b, c and Supplementary Table 2a). Other than hydrophobic interactions, W32 (CDRL1) forms hydrogen bonds with D46 of helix A (Fig. 4c).Consistent with the antibody’s broad activity against group 1 and group 2 influenza viruses, the epitope of PN-SIA28 is highly conserved among H1, H14, and H18 HAs (Fig. 3b, e, h and Supplementary Fig. 5). However, the substitution of Ser (H14 and H18) for His (H1) at HA1 amino acid 38 could potentially weaken the binding of PN-SIA28 (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 2a–c). Aside from the amino acid differences at position 38, the different orientations of His at HA1 amino acid 18 could also affect the overall energetics of binding between HA1 and the CDRH3 loop (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 2a-c). Both the imidazoles of H18 from H1 and H18 HA1, which form hydrogen bonds with N20 of HA1, interact with the CDRH3 of PN-SIA28. In contrast, the imidazole of H18 from H14 HA1 shears off, which does not make a hydrogen bond with V20 of HA1 and has no contact with the CDRH3 of PN-SIA28. This seems to be a common trait shared by group 2 HAs (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 2a-c). Additionally, only V40 of H1 HA1, but not H40 of H18 HA1 and K40 of H14 HA1, can form hydrophobic interactions with the CDRH3 of PN-SIA28. All of the above-mentioned interactions involving the amino acids of HA1 contribute to H1 being the HA with the highest affinity for PN-SIA28 (Fig. 1a).Aside from the interaction between residues at HA1 and CDRH3 of PN-SIA28 in the F subdomain, the most striking difference among the three PN-SIA28/HA complexes involves the interaction between the light chain and helix A of HA2. In the H14 complex with PN-SIA28, the light chain uses its extra CDRL2 to contact helix A. Notably, S52 (CDRL2) and S53 (CDRL2) are positioned within the hydrogen bonding distance of helix A N53 (Fig. 4d). In the H18 complex with PN-SIA28, the light chain uses its extra CDRL3 to contact helix A. Additionally, S30 (CDRL1) and S31 (CDRL1) are in the hydrogen bonding distance of helix A D46, and A91 (CDRL3) and A92 (CDRL3) are in hydrogen bonding distance of helix A Q42 (Fig. 4e). Moreover, the major epitope amino acids of the PN-SIA28 light chain on H1 (Q42, I45, and D46), H14 (Q42, I45, D46, and N53) and H18 (Q42, V45, and D46) are fairly conserved among the different HA subtypes (Supplementary Fig. 5).Comparison of PN-SIA28 with other broadly neutralizing antibodiesComparison of the PN-SIA28, CR9114, FI6v3, MEDI8852, and 39.29 structures in complex with HA revealed that these five antibodies all recognize helix A of HA2 and the adjacent hydrophobic groove35,36,37,39. Although the epitopes of these antibodies on HA overlap extensively, the features of the interactions are markedly different. CR9114 only uses its heavy chain to bind HA, but the light chains of the FI6v3, MEDI8852, PN-SIA28, and 39.29 Abs account for 20, 30, 35, and 60% of the total buried surface area, respectively (Fig. 5a). This indicates that the light chain can play an important role in neutralization by broad-spectrum influenza antibodies, as we proposed earlier34. Compared to other broad-spectrum influenza antibodies targeting the stem region of HA, the most distinctive feature of PN-SIA28 is that it mainly uses the same CDRHs and different CDRLs to bind different HAs (including HAs of group 1 and 2) (Fig. 4c–e). However, other broadly neutralizing Ab (bnAb), such as FI6v3 and MEDI8852 mainly use the same CDRHs and the same CDRLs to bind different HAs of different groups (Supplementary Fig. 6).Fig. 5: Binding specificities of PN-SIA28 compared to other stem-bound antibodies.a Epitopes of different broadly neutralizing antibodies on the HA surface. Residues of HA contacted by the heavy chain are colored magenta, residues of HA contacted by the light chain are colored yellow, and residues of HA contacted by both chains are colored orange. b PN-SIA28 interactions with H14 and comparison to the 39.29 interaction with H3. Overlay of PN-SIA28 bound to H14 and 39.29 bound to H3. HA2 of H14 and H3 are colored cyan and pale cyan. The heavy chains of PN-SIA28 and 39.29 are colored magenta and pink (left), and the light chains of PN-SIA28 and 39.29 are colored yellow and lemon (right), respectively.

The conserved residues are in red. c Detailed views of PN-SIA28 interactions with H1, H14, and H18. The key interacting residues are shown as sticks, and polar contacts are drawn as dashed lines.Full size imageIn addition, PN-SIA28 and 39.29 both use the IGHV3-30*01 germline that has a long heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (CDRH3) (16 amino acids). The comparison of the PN-SIA28 and 39.29 HA crystal structures shows that the heavy chains of PN-SIA28 and 39.29 adopt nearly the same topographical position on HA, and the light chains of PN-SIA28 and 39.29 display the same binding orientation (Fig. 5b). Another general feature of the PN-SIA28 complex with HA is the hydrogen bond between Y56 (CDRH2) and HA2 K153 (Fig. 5c and Fig. 4c, d, e). Sequence alignment of PN-SIA28 and 39.29 suggests that the substitution of Y56 (CDRH2) for N56 may be useful for 39.29 optimization (Fig. 5b, c).Conformational adaptation of PN-SIA28 upon complex formationThe high-resolution structures of the PN-SIA28 Fab alone and PN-SIA28 Fab variable fragment in complex with H18 HA allow us to analyze conformational changes of PN-SIA28 upon HA binding in detail (Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 4). The structural alignment of PN-SIA28 and PN-SIA28/H18 reveal that their CDR conformations are almost identical, except for CDRH3 (Fig. 6a). The CDRH3 loop formed by residues 97-100 G undergoes a largely rigid-body rotation, pivoted around S96 (CDRH3) and L100H (CDRH3) (Fig. 6b) to facilitate interactions with HA. Additionally, the side chain of F103 (CDRH3) moves by 4.5 Å to fit into the hydrophobic groove of the epitope.Fig. 6: PN-SIA28 binds to a conserved stem region of HA through CDRH3 conformational rearrangements upon complex formation.a Overlay of PN-SIA28 bound to H1, H14, or H18 (magenta) and the PN-SIA28 Fab alone (grey). The CDRs of PN-SIA28 are labeled. b Conformational rearrangements in PN-SIA28 upon complex formation. Conformational change of the CDRH3 loops upon HA engagement. The CDRH3 of the apo and bound structures is colored gray and magenta, respectively. The beginning and end of the moving regions are indicated with black ovals. The HA is shown in surface representation. The apo structure does not make interactions with HA and does not fit into its surface features; the conformational change is necessary for productive HA engagement. c Comparison of the structures of the CDRH3 in the complexes between PN-SIA28/H14 (left panel), MEDI8852/H7 (middle panel), and 39.29/H3 HA (right panel). In all cases, the key amino acids are shown in stick representation with other loops of the antibody shown as coils, colored according to (b). The HAs are shown as gray surfaces.Full size imageAs previously reported, 39.29 and MEDI8852 antibodies interact with residues in the hydrophobic groove and adjacent helix A in the fusion domain through the CDRH3 loop, which contains four similar amino acids (V-F-G-V/I)37,39. The corresponding amino acid sequence in the CDRH3 loop of PN-SIA28 is I-F-G-I (98-100 A). These tetrapeptides interact with the groove of their cognate HAs in a similar way (Fig. 6b). In addition, the amino acid at position 100B in the CDRH3 of PN-SIA28 is Tyr, which forms a hydrogen bond with I18 in the fusion peptide of different HAs (H1, H14, and H18) (Fig. 4c–e).DiscussionThere is an urgent medical need for the isolation and identification of broadly neutralizing human mAbs against multiple influenza virus subtypes and novel subtypes of zoonotic influenza viruses from domestic animals in the treatment of severe influenza49,50. The potential of broadly infectivity-neutralizing antibodies targeting the conserved stem region of HA has provided insights into antibody-based therapy for severe and late-stage influenza, particularly for infants, the elderly, and immuno-compromised people. In addition, the characteristics of the epitopes and paratopes obtained by the analysis of antibody-HA complexes can be employed to guide the rational design of more effective therapeutic molecules and universal vaccines against harmful and potentially harmful influenza viruses49.In this study, we performed structural and functional studies of a fully human mAb named PN-SIA28 that reacted with 12 HAs out of 18 influenza A antigenic subtypes and exhibited neutralizing activity against group 1 and 2 IAVs. Specifically, PN-SIA28 protects mice challenged with the H1N1 and H3N2 viruses42 and blocked infection and lethality of mice caused by the highly pathogenic H5N6 virus when administered up to 3 days after infection in vivo (Fig. 1a, b).The discovery of bat influenza viruses has altered and broadened our understanding of IAVs. On a phylogenetic level, the bat IAV H17 and H18 HA proteins belong to group 1 HA subtypes rather than group 2 and share a notable degree of structural similarity with conventional IAV HA glycoproteins15,51. Furthermore, both H17 and H18 HAs exhibit typical HA characteristics, including harboring a monobasic proteolytic cleavage site and triggering syncytia formation at low pH (pH 5.4 and pH 5.6, which is within the normal pH range of most common HAs)52. The HA of bat H17N10 and H18N11 influenza viruses does not bind sialic acids because of the distorted putative sialic acid binding site51. The MHC class II DR protein, on the other hand, has been demonstrated to mediate cellular entry16,17. Furthermore, the H18N11 virus can enter 293 T cells when co-transfected with plasmids containing MHC II from bats, pigs, mice, or chickens17, implying its potential threat to humans. Two canine cell lines (MDCK II and RIE 1495) can support the replication of the bat influenza virus, suggesting that dogs may serve as intermediate hosts on the path to humans53,54.Like other broad-spectrum Abs, the mechanisms of PN-SIA28-mediated neutralization of infection involve two processes of the infection cycle. Binding of PN-SIA28 to the stem of HAs on the infecting virus inhibits HA-mediated membrane fusion, which is critical for the initiation of infection. Additionally, PN-SIA28 prevented the formation and spread of newly made infectious virus through binding to precursor HA0 and blocking its cleavage at the end of infection (Fig. 2). Notably, in addition to conventional IAV HAs, PN-SIA28 could also inhibit H17- and H18-mediated membrane fusion, indicating its encouraging translational applications for both endemic and emerging potential IAVs.The epitope recognized by PN-SIA28, confirmed by crystal structures of the PN-SIA28/HA complexes solved here, has previously been described for influenza group-specific antibodies and for more broadly reactive antibodies35,37,39. Comprehensive comparison of the structures of cross-group bnAb complexed with both group 1 and group 2 HAs helps to explain their broadly activities. The cross-group binding of FI6v3 (for H1 and H3) and MEDI8852 (for H5 and H7) is attributable to their identical flexible CDRs (CDRHs and CDRLs) recognizing highly conservative epitopes35,39. In stark contrast with these two bnAb, the binding of PN-SIA28 to different HAs involves the same CDRHs and different CDRLs. Given that the CDRL conformations in PN-SIA28 bound and unbound structures are almost the same and CDRLs in PN-SIA28/HA complexes only interact with Helix A of different HAs, the different Helix A orientations in different HAs cause them bind to different CDRLs (Supplementary Fig. 7). Like H14, the imidazole of H18 of HA1 from the group 2 HAs cannot form hydrogen bonds with V20 of HA1, thus preventing interaction with CDRH3s. This could be part of the structural basis for PN-SIA28 as a group 1-preferential neutralizing Ab. Furthermore, the carbohydrate side chain at N38 of HA1 may weaken the interaction between HA and PN-SIA28, which may explain why PN-SIA28 cannot efficiently bind to H7, H10, or H15. Altogether, the orientations of H18 of HA1 and Helix A of HA2 may help explain the cross-reactivity of distinct IAVs, including bat H17 and H18, despite the amino acid differences in the epitopes of HA.Both PN-SIA28 and 39.29 use the IGHV3-30*01 germline37, but the substitution of Y56 for N56 in CDRH2 of PN-SIA28 increases the binding between the antibody and HA. Notably, PN-SIA28 neutralizes the H9N2 influenza A viruses, whereas 39.29 does not39,41. Additionally, the 39.29 light chain accounts for 60% of the total buried surface area compared to only 35% for PN-SIA28, which may explain why neutralization of 39.29 against the prevalent H3N2 virus in recent years is better than PN-SIA2837,41. The difference of neutralizing activity between PN-SIA28 and 39.29 may be mainly attributed to the light chain. The light chain of 39.29 interacts with more exposed regions of Helix A of HA2 than that of PN-SIA28. Therefore, the epitope amino acids of the 39.29 light chain are less conserved than those of PN-SIA28, contributing to the difference in the neutralization spectrum between 39.29 and PN-SIA28. Moreover, the PN-SIA28 heavy chain may bind to H3 HA by changing the orientation of the bulky carbohydrate chain attached to HA1 Asn38 like 39.2937. Altogether, this structural information helps to further optimize antibodies using the IGHV3-30*01 germline to produce more effective antibodies and underscores the necessity of developing proper heavy- and light-chain pairing. More importantly, this may represent a new mode of binding of cross-group neutralizing antibodies to different HAs.The structural characterization of PN-SIA28 bound and unbound structures highlights its long and flexible CDRH3, which can accommodate the differences in conformation and environment in the hydrophobic grove of the HA. The comparison of the structures of the complexes formed by the Abs and HAs indicates that the three antibodies had the amino acid sequences, V-F-G-V-MEDI8852 (100-100 C), V-F-G-I- 39.29 (98-100 A), and I-F-G-I-PN-SIA28 (98-100 A) in their CDRH3 loops that occupied equivalent positions in the complexes37,39. Moreover, the Y100B in CDRH3 of PN-SIA28 forms a hydrogen bond with H1, H14 or H18 HA, and this may imply that the hydrogen bond may be a common interaction between PN-SIA28 and different HA subtypes. Conceivably, the structure of this pentapeptide (I-F-G-I-Y) of PN-SIA28 might be used to select candidate molecules on the basis of their affinity for the tetra-peptides or pentapeptides like P755,56.In conclusion, we show that PN-SIA28 is a bnAb for both endemic IAVs like H1, H3, and H5, as well as emerging potential IAVs, including bat H17 and H18. The structures shown here help us better understand cross-group heterosubtypic binding activity, which is significant in terms of the development of therapeutic countermeasures against IAV.MethodsViruses and cellsViruses used in this study comprised wild-type isolates and reassortants, containing internal genes from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934, which were developed as candidate vaccine viruses for vaccine manufacturing (Fig. 1a). Viruses were propagated in Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells or in embryonated eggs. For passive protection studies in mice, wild-type A/Shenzhen/TH002/2016 (H5N6) was amplified in embryonated eggs43. Virus titers were determined by end point dilution in MDCK cells (TCID50). MDCK cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Gibco, cat. no. 11965) with or without 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). HEK293F cells were grown in suspension in SMM 293-TII medium (Sino Biological, Cat# M293TII) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator rotating at 130 rpm. Sf9 and Hi5 insect cell line from Invitrogen were cultured at 27 °C. All cell lines were tested negative for mycoplasma contamination.Recombinant HA and Ab proteinsThe gene fragments encoding the ectodomains of the HA proteins were individually cloned into the baculovirus shuttle vector pFastBac1(Invitrogen) by incorporating a GP67 signal peptide for HA secretion at the N-terminus and a thrombin cleavage site, a trimerization foldon sequence57, and a 6 × His tag at the extreme C-terminus for purification. The transfection and virus amplification were performed according to the user manual of the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System (Invitrogen). Sf9 cells (Invitrogen) were used for virus amplification, and HA proteins were produced by infecting suspension cultures of Hi5 cells (Invitrogen) for 2 days and recovered from the culture supernatants by metal affinity chromatography using a 5-mL HisTrap column (GE Healthcare). The purified HA was subjected to thrombin digestion (Thermo, a maximum of 50 U/mg of HA0) at 4 °C for 12 h to remove the C-terminal trimerization foldon sequence and 6 × His tag. The HA0 was further purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 10/300 column, and then the collected protein fractions were concentrated to approximately 20 mg/mL in storage buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and 150 mM NaCl) for use in structural and functional studies.The gene fragments encoding the variable domains of the heavy chain and light chain of human mAb PN-SIA28 were cloned into the IgG1 heavy and light expression vectors, PCAGGS-H-hIgG1 and PCAGGS-L-hIgG1, respectively. HEK-293 F cells were transfected with the IgG1 expression plasmids, and the expressed antibody was purified from the culture supernatants using a Protein A column (GE Healthcare). PN-SIA28 Fab was obtained by digesting PN-SIA28 mAb with papain (30:1 mAb: papain ratio) for 8-10 h at 37 °C and purified by affinity chromatography using a Protein A column (GE Healthcare), followed by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 10/300 column (GE Healthcare). The purified PN-SIA28 Fab was concentrated to approximately 20 mg/mL in storage buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and 150 mM NaCl) for use in structural studies.The gene fragments encoding the variable domains of the heavy chain and light chain of human mAb PN-SIA28 were also cloned into the pET-21a expression plasmid. BL21 competent cells were transformed with the pET-21a expression plasmids, and the expressed scFV PN-SIA28 antibody was purified by inclusion body refolding58. The purified scFV PN-SIA28 was concentrated to approximately 10 mg/mL in storage buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and 150 mM NaCl) for use in structural studies.Gel filtration survival detectionRecombinant HA proteins were mixed with purified Fab fragments at a molar ratio of 1:1.5 (HA: mAb) and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h in 20 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl buffer. The samples from individual HA reactions with or without Fab were then loaded onto a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare). The recorded chromatographs were overlaid, and the pooled proteins from each peak fraction were analyzed on 12% SDS-PAGE gels stained with Coomassie blue.Microneutralization assayThe microneutralization assays were performed as previously described59. Briefly, serial two-fold dilutions of mAb (1 mg/mL stock solution) in 50 mL were prepared and then mixed with the appropriate viruses (100 TCID50 in 50 mL per well). The mixture was placed in 96-well tissue culture plates and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Indicator MDCK cells (1.5 × 104 cells/well) were added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. To establish the endpoint, cell monolayers were then washed with PBS and fixed in acetone, and viral antigen was detected with an ELISA using a mAb anti-influenza A 7307 SPTN-5 against influenza A NP (Medix Biochemica) at a dilution of 1:5,000, and a HRP goat-anti-mouse IgG (H + L) secondary antibody (Invitrogen, 31430) at a dilution of 1:5,000. The virus neutralization titer was defined as the median of reciprocal values of the highest dilutions of antibody yielding ODs below the cutoff value. This cutoff is represented by a 50% specific signal calculated as (virus control OD + cell control OD)/2. The antibody concentration of the end point dilution (titer) represents the median neutralization of the virus analyzed.HA cleavage assayThe recombinant trimeric HAs from the H1N1, H5N6, H3N2, H14N6, H17N10, and H18N11 viruses were digested to HA1 and HA2 with TPCK-treated trypsin at a final concentration of 5 μg/mL for 2 h at 37 °C. The protease inhibitor Aprotinin (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to stop the reaction and then excluded by buffer exchange using a desalting column. Next, the protein was incubated with or without antibody (1:2 molar ratio) for 2 h at 37 °C. Then, the pH was lowered to 5.0 by replacing the buffer with 100 mM sodium acetate in all samples except for the controls. Being thoroughly mixed, the samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After incubation, the samples were equilibrated at room temperature, and the pH was neutralized by addition of 200 mM Tris (pH 8.5). TPCK-treated trypsin was then added to each sample to a final concentration of 10 μg/mL, and all samples were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The reaction was terminated by adding a loading buffer containing SDS. Samples were then loaded on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel after boiling at 95 °C for 5 min. H10 HA, which has low binding affinity for PN-SIA28, and trypsin-treated PN-SIA28 were acted as controls. To assess the ability of the Ab to block the cleavage of HA0 protein, baculovirus-expressed recombinant HA from A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) or A/Hong Kong/8/68 (H3N2) was incubated with or without PN-SIA28 at a molar ratio of 4:1 (mAb: HA) for 2 h. The HA with or without PN-SIA28 was then exposed to 2.5 µg/mL of TPCK-treated trypsin and further incubated for 10, 20, 40, 60, 90, and 120 min at 37 °C before being stopped by adding a loading buffer containing SDS and dithiothreitol. Samples were then loaded on 12% SDS-PAGE gels after boiling at 95 °C for 5 min.Binding affinity (KD) assayThe KD of the HAs from different virus strains for the PN-SIA28 mAb was determined by BLI at 25 °C using an Octet Red96 instrument (ForteBio, Inc.). HAs were biotinylated and immobilized on SA-coated biosensor surfaces and then exposed to the PN-SIA28 fab in solution. HAs were loaded onto SA-coated biosensors in kinetics buffer (1x PBS, pH 7.4) for 300 s. To measure the binding affinities, the association and dissociation of HAs were measured by exposing the sensors to gradient concentrations of the PN-SIA28 fab in kinetics buffer. The kinetic data sets were fitted using a 1:1 binding model (Octet RED96 analysis software 7.0) to yield the KD.Protection effects of mAbs on influenza virusesAll animal studies for the evaluation of the protection effects of PN-SIA28 on influenza viruses were conducted in accordance with the protocol approved by the Laboratory Animal Welfare and Ethics Committee in Institute of Microbiology Chinese Academy of Sciences. Prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy studies in mice used 6- to 8-week-old female SPF BALB/c mice (Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd.). All mice were allowed free access to water and standard chow diet and provided with a 12 h light and dark cycle (temperature: 20-25 °C, humidity: 40%-70%). All mice used in this study are in good health and are not involved in other experimental procedure. In the prophylactic studies, groups of five mice each received a dose of 1, 5, 10, or 30 mg/kg of PN-SIA28 or PBS buffer in a volume of 200 µL one day prior to intranasal challenge with 10 MLD50 of A/Shenzhen/TH002/2016 (H5N6) virus. In the therapeutic studies, groups of five mice each received 15 mg/kg of PN-SIA28 right after or 1, 2, or 3 days after challenge with 10 MLD50 of the A/Shenzhen/TH002/2016 (H5N6) virus. PBS buffer was administered at day 1 post-challenge. The survival rates and weight-loss statuses of the mice were monitored until 14 days after infection.Formation and purification of Fab or Fab/HA complexesPN-SIA28 Fab was mixed with purified, His tag-depleted, recombinant H1, H14, and H18 HA trimers at a molar ratio of five parts Fab to one part HA to ensure saturation with Fab. The resulting PN-SIA28 Fab variable fragment-H1 HA (PN-SIA28/H1), PN-SIA28 Fab variable fragment-H14 HA (PN-SIA28/H14), and PN-SIA28 Fab variable fragment-H18 HA (PN-SIA28/H18) complexes were purified from unbound substrates by size-exclusion gel filtration chromatography (Superdex 200 10/300 column; GE Healthcare) in a buffer comprising 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 150 mM NaCl or 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 150 mM NaCl, respectively. PN-SIA28/H1, PN-SIA28/H14, and PN-SIA28/H18 complexes were eluted as single peaks between the 158 and 670 kDa molecular weight markers, and were concentrated to 10 mg/mL for subsequent crystallization studies.Structure determination of the PN-SIA28/HA complexCrystallization was performed using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 18 °C by mixing an equal volume (0.1 mL) of the protein solution (10 mg/mL) and the reservoir solution. Preliminary crystallization conditions for the PN-SIA28/H1 complex were obtained after 7 days in several conditions, and diffraction quality crystals were obtained in 0.1 M magnesium acetate, 0.1 M sodium acetate, and 8% w/v PEG 8000 (pH 4.5). The PN-SIA28/H1 complex data set was collected from a single crystal at 3.2 Å resolution at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamline 19U. The diffraction quality crystals for the PN-SIA28/H14 complex were obtained at 18 °C using the sitting drop method with 2.0-µL drops containing 10 mg/mL PN-SIA28/H14 in the no.29 condition of the Molecular Dimension Screening Kit (MD1-50, Box 2) consisting of 0.1 M Tris, 5 % w/v PGA-LM, and 20 % w/v PEG 3350. The PN-SIA28/H14 complex data set was collected from a single crystal at 3.4 Å resolution at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamline 17U. The PN-SIA28/H18 complex was obtained at 2.6 Å in the no.39 condition of the Molecular Dimension Screening Kit (MD1-37, Box 2) consisting of 0.1 M Bis Tris and 25 % w/v PEG 3350 (pH 5.5) at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamline 17U. The diffraction quality crystals of PN-SIA28 fab were obtained in 0.1 M HEPES (pH 7.0) and 12% PEG 3350. The data set was collected at 2.5 Å resolution at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamline 17U.Data collection and refinement statistics are presented in Supplementary Table 1. Data were processed and scaled using HKL200060. The structures were solved by molecular replacement using Phaser61 from the CCP4 program suite62. Initial rigid body refinement was performed using REFMAC563, and extensive model building was performed using COOT (version 0.8.9)64. Further rounds of refinement were performed using the phenix.refine program implemented in the PHENIX package (version 1.13-2998)65 with energy minimization, isotropic ADP refinement, and bulk solvent modelling. The structures were then adjusted using COOT and were refined with PHENIX. The stereochemistry and quality of the structural models was analyzed using Molprobity66, the PISA server67, and programs in the CCP4 suite and were validated using the wwPDB validation server (http://wwpdb-validation.wwpdb.org/validservice). All structures were generated using PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org).Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

(Andrea Gantz)Two more South American countries have reported infections of highly pathogenic avian influenza to the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH).While neither case is in a large-scale commercial poultry flock, these are the first reported instances of HPAI in Peru and Venezuela. Elsewhere in South America, earlier cases were reported in Colombia and Ecuador.Avian influenza in PeruThe presence of HPAI was first suspected in Peru on November 18, during epidemiological surveillance activities in areas of Lambayeque, where seabirds were dying. Near that area at one farm, an increase in mortality in poultry was noticed. Twenty-one birds were also exhibiting signs such as lethargy, greenish diarrhea and cyanosis of the chin. Tissue samples and swabs were collected from a rooster and a duck, and sent to the national Animal Health Diagnostic Center. The owner stated that 15 days ago he vaccinated his birds against Newcastle disease and fowl cholera, and seven days after vaccination he observed a mortality of 200 ducks. On November 30, all birds on the farm were culled, followed by sanitary burial in the same place. A total of 241 birds were lost. Cleaning and disinfection of the farm is taking place. Within the 5 kilometers of the outbreak, there are five commercial poultry farms with a total population of 105,600 birds. The type identified is avian influenza type A subtype H5. Neuraminidase typing is pending, WOAH reported.Avian influenza in VenezuelaOn 25 November, the National Institute of Integral Agricultural Health (INSAI) received a report of mortality observed in pelicans in mangroves in Puerto Píritu lagoon, in the area of the Luis Cabeza Martínez ecological recreational park, north of the Anzoátegui state. Four birds were necropsied and tissue samples were taken and sent to the National Institute of Hygiene Rafael Rangel (INHRR), where the first laboratory diagnosis was obtained on November 27, and the H5 subtype was identified. Subsequently, the Venezuelan Institute for Scientific Research (IVIC) confirmed the diagnosis and completed the characterization of the virus as H5N1 on November 29, 2022. There are no commercial poultry farms in the area, but active epidemiological surveillance is being maintained in backyard poultry in the area, as well as passive surveillance in wild birds.RecommendedLatest NewsNational Turkey Federation offering 'Thanksgiving 101' tips and recipesLatest NewsHormel Foods honoredRelated StoriesEggAvian flu cases continue in South Dakota, British ColumbiaEggBritish Columbia becomes province with most HPAI casesEgg ProductionTraceability software provides poultry logistic transparencyEggHPAI impact on Jennie-O in fall less severe than in springMore in EggIndustry OrganizationsVirginia Egg Council’s Cecelia Glembocki to retireBrand InsightsThink strategically in developing IBDV vaccination programsZoetisDeveloping vaccination programs for IBDV requires strategic use of several vaccine types.Animal WelfareNoble Foods, actor Kelvin Fletcher partner on hen welfareStructures for climbing and tires filled with dust are just a couple of the enrichment materials the egg producer provides its birds.Business and MarketsVital Farms reports over 30% net revenue boost in 2024New offerings, retail distribution gains are given as some of the reasons sales grew in the most recent quarter.Egg ProcessingWhy the egg sector should look more to pet careThere are numerous reasons why egg producers ought to more fully embrace pet nutrition and care.EggUK egg producer Farmlay invests in new grading capacityState-of-the-art egg grader, to be installed in January 2025, responds to growing consumer demand for eggs and more favorable investment climate.EggMichael Foods boosts efficiency at new Minnesota feed millLeading egg producer replaced two aging feed mills with a single, fully automated one, ushering in a new era for Gaylord feed operation.Hen Housing SystemsHow Burnbrae Farms aims to overcome activist challengesBurnbrae Farms CEO Margaret Hudson explains how the company is dealing with an active campaign from an animal activist group.Latest NewsKathy Brodhagen is new CEO at Echo Lake FoodsShe brings to the company years of experience in the egg products industry.EggHappy Egg completes merger with Egg InnovationsThe merger brings together two of the largest U.S. based free-range and pasture-raised egg companies.EuropeMoldovan farm authorized to export eggs to EUGeorge Standard has invested in improvements to production methods and raised product standards to meet the EU standards.EggBurcon launches Puratein for egg replacement applicationsEgg ProductionCooper Farms increases liquid egg productionNew silos will increase storage capacity by 50%.Page 1 of 484Next PageNews and analysis for the global poultry industryFollow WATTPoultry.comFacebook iconLinkedIn iconYouTube iconDelete My DataTopicsPoultry MeatEggPoultry HealthSustainabilityPoultry FutureMoreWebinarsBrand InsightsPodcastsWhite PapersWATT Poultry ChatTop Companies Data DownloadsMagazinesSubscribeAdvertiseAbout UsContact UsMedia RequestPrivacy PolicySite Map© 2024 All rights reserved.Transcriptome signatures preceding the induction of anti-stalk antibodies elicited after universal influenza vaccination | npj Vaccines Skip to main content Thank you for visiting nature.com.

Vaccination with adjuvanted-inactivated vaccines induced high anti-stalk antibody titers. We sought to identify gene expression signatures that correlate with such induction. Messenger-RNA sequencing in whole blood was performed on the peripheral blood of 53 vaccinees. We generated longitudinal data on the peripheral blood of 53 volunteers, at early (days 3 and 7) and late (28 days) time points after priming and boosting with cHAs. Differentially expressed gene analysis showed no differences between placebo and live-attenuated vaccine groups. However, an upregulation of genes involved in innate immune responses and type I interferon signaling was found at day 3 after vaccination with inactivated adjuvanted formulations. Cell type deconvolution analysis revealed a significant enrichment for monocyte markers and different subsets of dendritic cells as mediators for optimal B cell responses and significant increase of anti-stalk antibodies in sera. A significant upregulation of immunoglobulin-related genes was only observed after administration of adjuvanted vaccines (either as primer or booster) with specific induction of anti-stalk IGVH1-69. This approach informed of specific immune signatures that correlate with robust anti-stalk antibody responses, while also helping to understand the regulation of gene expression induced by cHA proteins under different vaccine regimens.

Most commonly used influenza virus vaccines contain four different vaccine strains: two influenza A virus components belonging to the H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes; and two influenza B virus components derived from the B/Victoria/2/87-like and B/Yamagata/16/88-like lineages. The vaccine strains are selected based on worldwide surveillance and prediction methods to determine the most likely circulating antigenic variants of the upcoming influenza season. However, circulating influenza virus strains are continuously evolving and surveillance efforts are not equally effective around the world and may result in mismatches between circulating strains and vaccine strains leading to reduced efficacy2. Influenza virus vaccines are updated annually due to the rapid accumulation of mutations in the haemagglutinin (HA)—and to a lesser extent—in the neuraminidase (NA) genes of the viruses. This phenomenon, known as antigenic drift, originates from the ability of influenza viruses to escape pre-existing immunity in humans. A second mechanism to evade immune recognition is known as antigenic shift based on the acquisition of genes coding for novel surface proteins. Antigenic shift is responsible for the emergence of pandemic influenza virus strains. While the current licensed seasonal influenza virus vaccines are still the best preventive measure against influenza virus infection3,4, they are strain-specific and have a narrow coverage. We need improved strategies that can provide broad and long-lasting protection against multiple influenza virus strains, including pandemic influenza viruses. In addition, the development of improved next-generation universal influenza virus vaccines would also prevent seasonal vaccine failure due to mismatches between the predicted strains and the circulating influenza viruses.We have developed chimeric HA (cHA) vaccination strategies targeting conserved regions of the HA surface protein, particularly the stalk domain5,6,7. In contrast to the head of the HA, the stalk domain is relatively conserved8,9. However, immune responses are largely targeted against the head, which is immunodominant and rather permissive to mutations2,10. To overcome this, the cHAs strategy exposes the immune system sequentially to constructs that share the same stalk domain (group 1, group 2 or influenza B HA stalks) but in combination with different head domains from exotic avian influenza virus subtypes6,7,11. This leads to preferential induction of responses against the stalk through reactivation of memory B cells, while the de novo response against the novel head domains, which the immune system has never encountered before is relatively weak. We used this approach to perform an observer-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase I trial (NCT03300050) to assess the safety and immunogenicity of chimeric hemagglutinin-based vaccines in adults. Results are published5,6 and showed that our cHA-based universal influenza virus vaccine approach is safe and elicited a strong response of broadly cross-reactive antibodies against the HA stalk. In addition, the antibody response was durable, and anti-stalk antibodies lasted during the 1.5-year follow-up. These data are encouraging since antibodies directed against the stalk of the group 1 HA have demonstrated not only to provide protection against pandemic H1N1 virus infection12, but also disease severity and development of lower respiratory infections13. In addition, stalk antibodies have shown antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) and phagocytosis (ADCP) activity, which can help to clear the virus after the infection has been established in epithelial cells14,15. Indeed, the induced antibody response by our cHA group 1 vaccines also showed strong activity in both ADCC and ADCP reporter bioassays6.Here we expand on the safety and immunogenicity studies of our group 1 cHA-based universal influenza virus vaccine candidate6 by performing RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of whole blood from vaccinees to identify gene expression signatures that correlate with the induction of group 1 stalk antibodies. We generated longitudinal unblinded RNA-seq data of 53 volunteers, at early (days 3 and 7) and late (28 days) time points after priming and boosting with the cHA vaccines and found that an early upregulation of genes involved in innate immune response and type I interferon (IFN) signaling was followed by upregulation of genes involved in B cell activation and proliferation in subjects with higher anti-stalk antibody induction. Moreover, cell type deconvolution analysis revealed a significant enrichment for monocytes and different subsets of dendritic cells (DC) that mediated an optimal B cell response. The current study provides a better understanding of the mechanism of regulation of gene expression and the transcriptional pathways that must be activated to induce optimal vaccine responses after vaccination with cHA proteins, which are likely to also be involved in the induction of immunity by other vaccines.ResultsSignificant changes in gene expression precede the robust induction of anti-stalk antibodiesThis clinical trial was designed under the assumption that adult humans possess pre-existing immunity to the H1 HA, including low levels of antibodies and memory B cells with specificity against the HA stalk domain. The objective was to redirect the immune response to the immunosubdominant stalk through sequential vaccination with cHA constructs that feature head domains from avian influenza virus subtypes but share the same H1 stalk domain (Fig. 1A). Fifty-three volunteers were randomized into three different vaccine groups and two placebo control groups in a regimen of prime-booster vaccination: Group 1 (G1) received cH8/1N1 live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) on day 1 followed by AS03A-adjuvanted cH5/1N1 inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) on day 85 (LAIV8-IIV5/AS03). Group 2 (G2) received the same vaccination regimen but with nonadjuvanted booster vaccination (LAIV8-IIV5). Group 4 (G4) received adjuvanted cH8/1N1 IIV followed by adjuvanted cH5/1N1 IIV (IIV8/AS03-IIV5/AS03). Group 5 (G5) served as an outpatient placebo group and received PBS intramuscularly twice (PBS-PBS). The sequential vaccination strategy, as well as the scheme of vaccination groups and blood collection timeline is shown in Fig. 1A–C. A detailed description of the trial design, immunogenicity and safety of the experimental vaccines can be found in Nachbagauer et al.6. Of note, an additional saline intranasally placebo group was enrolled (G3) but was not included for the present RNAseq analysis because it was considered equivalent to G5.Fig. 1: Overview of design and experimental approach (CVIA057; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03300050).A Sequential cHA vaccination strategy and the different vaccination groups. B Study design including vaccination and blood collection timeline. Three different vaccination regimens as well as placebo group were included. Group 1 received cH8/1N1 LAIV on day 1 followed by AS03-adjuvanted cH5/1N1 IIV on day 85 (LAIV8-IIV5/AS03). Group 2 received the same vaccination regimen but with the booster vaccination nonadjuvanted (LAIV8-IIV5). Group 4 received adjuvanted cH8/1N1 IIV followed by adjuvanted cH5/1N1 IIV (IIV8/ AS03-IIV5/AS03). Group 5 served as placebo control group and received PBS intramuscularly twice (PBS-PBS). C Blood for transcriptomic profiling was collected (indicated in red) at baseline (day 1), days 3, 7, and 29 post prime; and on day 85 (pre-boost), day 93 (day 7 post-boost), and day 113 (day 29 post- boost). Paired samples for antibody quantification (light blue) were collected only on days 1, 29, 85, and 113. D Serum anti-H1 stalk titers. IgG titers in the LAIV8-IIV5/AS03, LAIV8-IIV5, IIV8/AS03-IIV5/AS03, and the placebo groups against recombinant cH6/1 HA substrate are shown in Berstein et al.5 and Nachbaguauer et al.6. The geometric mean titer (GMT, big dots) and confidence interval (CI 95%) are shown. E Fold induction during the longitudinal follow up is also shown. Geometric mean fold rise (GMFR, big dots) and confidence interval (CI 95%) are shown.Full size imageSerum samples for antibody quantification were collected at baseline (day 1), and day 29 post-prime; day 85 (pre-boost) and day 113 (day 29 post-boost) (Fig. 1C). We used data from Nachbagauer et al. 6 to represent the anti-stalk antibody induction shown in Fig. 1D, E. The group receiving the IIV8/AS03 priming (G4) had the higher increase in stalk antibodies while priming with LAIV8 did not induce specific antibodies against the stalk of the HA. Comparable results between the groups were found after the boost, with higher induction in subjects from G1 receiving IIV5/AS03 as a booster, followed by volunteers from Group 2 (IIV5 booster). To investigate early molecular changes after receiving the experimental vaccines, whole blood was subjected to RNA sequencing for transcriptional profiling and the correlation of these changes with the anti-stalk antibody responses found in Nachbagauer et al. 6 investigated. For this, blood was collected at baseline (day 1), day 3, day 7, and day 29 post prime; and day 85 (pre-boost), day 92 (day 7 post-boost), and day 113 (day 29 post-boost).We first performed differential gene expression analysis to assess the dynamic changes in gene expression between each of the vaccination groups compared to placebo. A total of 227 genes were differentially expressed between the vaccination groups and placebo for all the timepoints, with no significant differences at baseline. A heatmap of average gene expression changes for each comparison indicated that most changes occurred at day 3 and day 7 in the G4 group (IIV8/AS03 – IIV5/AS03), while significant differences were absent for the other vaccination groups after the prime (Fig. 2A). Although the global transcriptional profile for G1 resembled that of G4, only two genes reached the threshold of significance, CERK (Ceramide Kinase), and PRDM8 (PR Domain Zinc Finger Protein 8). These two genes were downregulated and are associated with cell migration metabolism during inflammation and negative regulation transcription activity respectively. The initially induced responses decreased by day 28 and pre-boost, at day 85. In addition, we found significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for G1 seven days after receiving the booster dose on day 92. The top G4-induced genes at day 3 included genes related to innate immunity activation and IFN signaling while DGEs at day 7 were related to B cell proliferation signatures. Interestingly, the transcriptional profile was similar between these two groups after receiving the IIV/AS03 vaccine for the first time, marked by expression of IGHG1, IGLV1-44, and B cell-related genes at day 7 post-prime for G4, and day 7 post-boost in G1. Interestingly, induction of IGHG1, IGLV1-44 was only present after the use of AS03 adjuvanted formulation, while no induction was found for the non-adjuvanted G2 at day 92 when compared to PBS. Overall, our data could indicate a link between the use of the adjuvant and a specific induction of these genes.Fig. 2: Global transcriptional profile in the CVIA 057 clinical trial.A Heatmap of differential expressed genes (DEG) in the groups receiving the experimental vaccine compared to placebo (G5: PBS/PBS): group 1 (G1: LAIV8-IIV5/AS03), group 2 (G2: LAIV8-IIV5) and group 4 (G4: IIV8/ AS03-IIV5/AS03).

Asterisk indicates time points with Bayes adjusted p value ≤ 0.05, corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method. The error bars and whiskers indicate mean ± standard error (SE).Full size imageNext, we performed within-group longitudinal comparisons relative to baseline (day 1) levels. This approach allows not only to characterize the transcriptional programs that are being regulated for each vaccination group, but it also controls for interindividual differences in pre-existing transcript levels. When compared to baseline levels within each group, G4 vaccinees showed significant induction or downregulation of at day 3 (2321 genes) and 7 after priming (81 genes), while no changes were detected after the prime dose with LAIV or placebo (G1, G2, and G5, respectively). The longitudinal comparisons also confirmed that after the booster dose, only the subjects who received the IIV5-AS03 (G1) showed significant induction of gene expression (80 genes). Altogether significant transcriptional responses as early as day 3 after vaccination anticipated significant changes in stalk antibody levels measured 29 days later (Table S1).Transcriptional changes upon immunization with the trivalent LAIV vaccine has previously been reported [PMID: 21743478], given the lack of significant induction in the LAIV8 primed groups we examined the expression changes of inflammation-related genes (gene ontology categories GO:0006954 inflammatory responses, GO:0009615 response to virus, GO:0034097 response to cytokines, and GO:0045087 innate immune response) relative to baseline and regardless of significance for each group (Fig. 2B, C). In agreement with the across-groups comparisons, the longitudinal analysis showed that one of the LAIV8 recipient groups (G1) had a similar trend in temporal gene expression changes as G4 during the priming. We then performed Gen Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for the same longitudinal comparisons for which both, innate and adaptive immune pathways were enriched after the priming LAIV8 dose in G1 and to a lesser extent in G2 (Figure S1).IIV8/AS03 – IIV5/AS03 administration induced early activation of cell signaling and innate immune pathways associated with B cell proliferation and induction of anti-stalk antibodiesTo better understand the relationship between anti-stalk antibody induction and the dynamic regulation of gene expression longitudinally, we expanded our previous analysis and investigated the functional pathways perturbed after prime-boost in G4 (IIV8/AS03 – IIV5/AS03) vaccinees. We first analyzed changes early after priming (day 3 and day 7). As shown in Fig. 3A, significant differences were mostly found on day 3, with 1317 upregulated genes versus 1004 genes downregulated. The number of upregulated genes decreased on day 7 (80 genes) and only two genes were found to be downregulated. By day 29, no significant differences were found relative to the vaccine regimens suggesting that gene expression changes were back to baseline. We next used this analysis to perform gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis (Fig. 3B) and to build volcano plots (Fig. 3C, D). The gene expression changes were associated with 59 (up-) and 33 (down-) biological processes (BP) categories on day 3 (Source Data 1), which included innate immune responses and responses to virus infection. Particularly, the top-10 enriched GO categories of induced genes included cytokine signaling and immune cell activation (Fig. 3B). Genes included in these pathways were classical genes induced in response to virus exposure, such as ISG15, IFIT3, OAS1, DDX58 (RIG-I) or SERPING1, among others (Fig. 3C and Table S1). In contrast, downregulated BP included chromatin organization and regulation of transcription and histone acetylation, suggesting cell remodeling changes triggered by immune signaling. On day 7, the top-10 GO categories of upregulated genes transitioned from innate immunity to activation of adaptive immune cells (Fig. 3B), including leukocyte migration, phagocytosis and recognition, and regulation of B cell activation. In total there was enrichment of 17 GO categories on day 7 post-prime (Table S1), aligned with a high upregulation of immunoglobulin transcripts and the CD38 cell activation marker (Fig. 3D and Table S1). When looking at the top upregulated immunoglobulin transcripts, we found that the response was dominated by a variety of clonotypes, with an overrepresentation of IGKV1-39 followed by IGHG1 > IGLV1-44 > IGKV1D-39 > IGHG3 (Fig. 3D). As expected, by day 29 gene expression reverted to pre-vaccination levels and no significant differences were found when the peak of the antibody response was detected by serological methods. Similarly, no significant changes of the transcriptional profile were detected on day 85, before the booster dose, or on day 93 (post-boost), consistent with a minimal increase of anti-stalk antibodies in this group (Fig. 1C).Fig. 3: Longitudinal transcriptional profile of IIV8/AS03-IIV5/AS03 vaccination group (G4).A Heatmap of DEG changes on day 3, 7, and 29 of subjects of G4.

Source data referring to A-B are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageThe immune response is a complex biological process that requires multiple interactions among immune cells with heterogenous differentiation states and signaling pathways. We next decided to interrogate the changes in function and cell-type composition of the cells circulating in blood after vaccination with the cHA influenza vaccine. For this we used transcriptional signatures obtained from healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) profiled by bimodal protein-RNA measurements with Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-Seq) at the single-cell level16. These cell type-specific gene expression signatures consisted of 58 cell types and subtypes, including subsets of the T, B, and myeloid cell compartments. To simplify cell type groups, subclusters were collapsed into 37 major cell types. We applied a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 (adjusted p value, Fisher’s exact test) to deconvolute the bulk DEG data and determine cell type-specific specific signatures enriched or depleted in the peripheral blood of G4 after priming with IIV8/AS03 on day 3 and 7 (Fig. 4A). Fold-change gene signatures revealed a significant enrichment for monocyte markers, both classical-CD14+ and non-classical-CD16+, and different markers of dendritic cell (DC) subset on day 3 post-prime. To note, from our bulk RNAseq data, we are not able to distinguish between enrichments due to changes in the relative composition of blood cell types versus enrichments due to functional activation of immunological cell states and signaling pathways in such cell types. Regardless of this limitation, the results were consistent with the biological processes found to be enriched in the GO analysis. The enriched signatures are associated with populations that are main mediators of cell signaling processes, innate immune responses, and antigen presentation. Enrichments on day 7 suggested that relative cell type-specific signatures and/or composition changed to an enrichment of B cells with different maturity state: memory > intermediate > naive of the kappa and lambda chain expressing cells. At this timepoint a significant enrichment was also found for antibody-secreting cells: plasma cells > plasmablast suggesting the presence of affinity matured long- and short-life antibody-producing cells induced by the universal vaccine prototype. In addition, plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) specific signatures were also induced at days 3 (p value = 1.04 × 10−13, Fisher’s exact test) and 7 (p value = 4.09 × 10−9), with the earlier enrichment of conventional DC (cDCs), on day 3 post-prime. Figure 4B shows the fold-change enrichment for 29 cell types, including subsets from the main cell type lineages: CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, DCs, monocytes, and natural killers (NK) on day 3 and 7 post-prime. An additional analysis with a different enrichment method (xCell [PMID: 29141660]) and cell-type reference showed that most of the results from our original cell type enrichment analysis were consistent, with a few differences. In particular, pDCs were only enriched at day 3 and not at day 7, and plasma cells were not enriched at day 3 but only at day 7 (Fig. S2). Finally, we quantified the diversity of immunoglobulin (Ig) transcripts that were differentially expressed, as a proxy for the induction of antibodies in response to vaccination. The relative composition of enriched isotypes and subclasses, and the heavy, kappa light, and lambda light chain (IGH, IGK and IGL) loci usage for the variable (V) regions on day 7 after priming with IIV8/AS03 are shown in Fig. 4C and D. Enriched transcripts included members of all loci (Fig. 4C). Much of the response of the constant (C) region was dominated by IGHG and IGHM isotypes, while the most abundant subtypes were, as expected, IGHG1 > IGHG3 > IGHG4 (Fig. 4C). For the V regions, the majority of IGH genes were from the IGHV3 (35%) and IGHV4 (32%) subgroups followed by IGHV1 > IGHV5. For the IGK locus, enriched transcripts were dominated by those from the IGKV1 (51%) and IGKV3 (24%) and IGKV4 (23%) subgroups, while the IGL locus was dominated by IGLV1 (36%) followed by IGLV2 (33%) and V3 (24%), and included transcripts from at least 6 different loci17 (Fig. 4D).Fig. 4: Cell type deconvolution and induction of immunoglobulin genes in G4.A Main cell types enriched or depleted in the peripheral blood of patients after priming with IIV8/AS03 compared to baseline (day 1) on day 3 and 7.

First, we looked at individual cH6/1 IgG antibody responses before (pre-) and 29 days (post-) after prime. All vaccinees showed similar antibody titers post-prime (Fig. 5A). We next calculated the fold rise on cH6/1 antibodies as the ratio between post- antibody value to pre-levels for each vaccinee. We then computed the geometric mean rise (GMR) by taking the exponent (log10) of the mean fold rise of all individuals. As shown in Fig. 5B, GMR (95% CI) was 12.1 (6.9–21.2). We then set a GMR value of 10 as a threshold of higher (>GMR, above the geometric mean) versus lower (≤GMR, below the geometric mean) vaccine responders. A comparison of both low (n = 6) and high (n = 9) responders at baseline showed no pre-existing differences that could explain the variability in the magnitude of the antibody response after vaccination. We next investigated differences on gene expression on day 3 and 7 post-vaccination by comparing each group to their respective baselines (day 0). A total of 469 (390 up and 79 down) and 942 (620 up and 322 down) genes were differentially expressed for the low and high responders, respectively, on day 3. Among these genes, 310 were upregulated in both groups, all of them related to canonical immune response processes (Fig. 5C, D). Gene ontology analysis of genes that were exclusively up (n = 80) in the low responders returned no significant GO annotated processes, whereas those that were exclusively up in the high responders included additional genes mainly related to innate immune response and cytokine-mediated signaling (Fig. 5D, top 10 categories). In addition, processes exclusively upregulated in high responders included mitochondrial organization, respiratory chain and upregulation of transcription factor activity (Source Data 2). For the downregulated genes, those that were common or exclusive to either group did not return relevant GO categories implicated in immune activation (Source Data 2). We then compared levels of the top-10 expressed genes between individuals with low and high antibody titers. Results showed that, while non-significant, expression across the top DEGs was lower in individuals with fold induction of anti-stalk antibodies below the geometric mean (Fig. 5E). While differences in group size (low, n = 6 vs high n = 9) could affect the power to detect DEGs, the differences in absolute expression levels in each group suggest that the overall differences between low and high responders were due to the magnitude of the induction rather than the expression of specific gene programs. On day 7, the transcriptional response for both low- and higher-responders converged in the expression of an adaptive immune response signature, including complement activation, leukocyte migration and B cell activation (Fig. 5D). Notably, the levels of expression for Ig genes on day 7 were similar regardless of the magnitude of the measured antibody response (Fig. 5F).Fig. 5: Transcriptional changes in subjects with high induction of anti-stalk antibodies in G4 after priming with IIV8/AS03.A IgG titers against cH6/1 in group one subjects after prime.

However, LAIV-primed individuals showed a significant increase of antibody titers after boosting with IIV5/AS03, or IIV5 only, in the G1 and G2 groups, respectively. We aimed to characterize the functional pathways perturbed by the booster regimen. We interrogated G1 first since antibody responses on day 113 (29 post-boost) were higher compared to the other vaccination groups after the booster dose. Longitudinal changes of gene expression were determined after normalization by baseline or day 85 (pre-boost) as indicated in Fig. 6A: day 85, 92, and 113 using baseline as a reference; or day 92 and 113 using day 85 as a reference. No significant differences were found between baseline before priming (day 1) and pre-boost (day 85), and DEGs at day 92 showed comparable transcriptomic profiles independent of the reference used. However, a higher number of significant DEG’s compared to baseline than to day 85 was found. Enrichment of 72 genes related to B cell activation and immunoglobulin transcription were identified: IGHG1 > IGLV1-44 > IGKV2D-29 > IGHV1-69 > IGKV2-28. Remarkably, similarly than G4 after prime, induction of IGHG1, IGLV1-44 was high, and only present after the use of AS03 adjuvanted formulation. Furthermore, we found preferential usage of IGHV1-69 among the top-10 DEGs. In addition, IGHV1-69-2, and IGVH1-18 were also found among the top-25 genes induced after the boost. Since anti-HA stalk antibodies are preferentially encoded by immunoglobulin heavy chain V region gene VH1-69 and VH1-1818, usage of these clonotypes indicated that the vaccine used in this trial induced specific and not generic immune responses against the stalk of group 1 HA protein. The intersection of the top-10 most significant biological processes, and top-10 significant genes at day 92 are shown in Fig. 6B, C. Finally, gene expression levels at day 113 (day 29 post-boost) were restored to baseline levels before vaccination, similar to those on day 29 after prime.Fig. 6: Transcriptomic profile of LAIV8-IIV5/AS03 vaccination group (G1) on day 92 (7 days after the booster dose).A Heatmap of longitudinal DEG changes at day 92 (day 7 after boost) and day 113 (day 29 after the boost) of subjects in G1 compared to day 1 before priming with LAIV87 and after priming on day 85.

GMR Geometric mean rise.Full size imageBefore we showed that G1 (LAIV8-IIV5/AS03) and G4 (IIV8-IIV5/AS03) induced similar antibody levels and functional patterns after receiving the inactivated adjuvanted cHA vaccine for the first time, either after boosting or priming, respectively (Fig. 2A). Since G1 vaccinees were primed with LAIV8, we asked whether relative cell type composition and relative Ig repertoire would also be the same. Cell type deconvolution (shown in Fig. 6D) indicated similar enrichment of cell types enriched in G1 after boost compared to G4 after prime (Fig. 4A). However, some differences were found when comparing the Ig transcripts encoding for the C region of immunoglobulin heavy chains. Ig alpha (IgA) is the major immunoglobulin class in body secretions and can be found on linings of the respiratory tract, digestive system, and saliva19. It was expected that the administration of LAIV8 would induce mucosal antibodies at the mucosal surfaces. However, saliva and serum samples analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for anti-stalk IgA and secretory IgA (sIgA) showed no such antibodies in G1 or G2 after LAIV administration6. Contrary to this, when we look at the relative abundance of the Ig repertoire transcripts (Fig. 6E, F), we found that it was still dominated by IGHG, but vaccinees from the G1 also showed an enrichment of the IGHA subclass (19%). This contrasted with G4, in which the response was dominated by IGHG followed by IGHM and no IGHA transcripts were detected (Fig. 4C). Except for the presence of IGHA1 transcripts, the composition of transcripts from the C region in G1 (Fig. 6F) was similar to G4 (Fig. 4D). However, the diversity and the relative proportion of Ig transcripts at the V chains from the IGH, IGK, and IGL loci was also different from those elicited by the G4. Subgroups of encoded transcripts for G1 included IGHV3 (46% each), IGHV1 (35%), and IGHV4 (19%) only, whereas the IGK responses were dominated by the IGKV3 subgroup (IGKV3 and IGKV3D accounted for 45% of IGKV detected transcripts) followed by the IGKV3 (29%) and IGKV2 (6%). Lastly, the induced IGL transcripts were less diverse compared to G4, with only IGLV1 (57%), IGLV3 (23%), and IGLV2 (20%) subgroups being expressed. The immunoglobulin repertoire on day 7 after boost with IIV5/AS03 across the differentiation spectrum is shown in Fig. 6E. The observed differences in the repertoire of Ig transcripts and detection of IgA expression show that the intramuscular adjuvanted vaccine effectively boosted previously undetectable mucosal immunity induced by the LAIV8 prime. This in contrast with G2 for which the only difference in the vaccine regime was the presence of adjuvant in the booster dose. To understand the possible contribution of the adjuvant on the induction of IGHA1 and IGHA2, we also investigated levels of IGHA1 or IGHA2 in G4 subjects who received IIV8/AS03-IIV5/AS03. After comparison with baseline levels (Day 1) or 7 days post-boost (Day 92), no enrichment of IGHA1 or IGHA2 was found when only inactivated-adjuvanted formulation was used. This indicates that while adjuvant can be related to the increase of IGHA1 or IGHA2 when priming with LAIV8, no effect on IGHA1 or IGHA2 is observed when only inactivated-adjuvanted formulation was used.Finally, similar to G4, we looked at expression levels across individuals that developed low (≤GMR) or high (>GMR) cH6/1 antibody titters, as measured by ELISA. Both groups showed similar levels of gene expression on day 7 post-boost, regardless of measured antibody titers at the late timepoint post-boost, on day 113 (Fig. 6G). This was independent of pre-existing immunity as Ig transcript levels before priming or boosting showed no correlation with induction of antibody levels.Differences of vaccine-induced antibody responses attributed to the adjuvantBecause we observed that higher IgG responses in serum were associated with the use of the AS03 adjuvant after boosting with the inactivated formulation, we interrogated the specific contribution of the adjuvant to the gene expression signatures detected. For this, we compared DEGs between G1 (IIV5/AS03) versus G2 (IIV5) on day 7 post-boost in parallel to DEGs between G1 (IIV5/AS03) and G5 (PBS) at the same time point. Analysis showed 92 (up-) and 28 (down-) genes for the G1 vs. G2 comparison; and 29 (up-) and 10 (down-) for the G1 vs. placebo (Fig. 7A, B). When we compared the GO categories enriched, we determined that both comparisons shared categories such as complement activation (classical pathway), leukocyte migration, and regulation of B cell activation. In contrast, some categories were unique for the G1 vs. G2 including phagocytosis (recognition and engulfment), immune-activating cell surface receptor signaling pathway or protein folding (Fig. 7C). Finally, we considered that the comparison of G1 versus G2 assessed the contribution of the adjuvant independently (although in the context) of IIV5, while the comparison of G1 versus G5—placebo—assessed the contribution of both IIV5 and AS03. If we then intersect the datasets obtained, the induction or depletion of those genes in common should be driven by the use of the AS03 adjuvant independently. As shown in the Venn-diagram (in Fig. 7D), 27 of the induced genes were shared between both datasets. While 12 of them were directly related to transcription of Ig: IGHG1, IGHG3, IGKV1D-39, or JCHAIN among others; 15 referred to other processes such as regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses, including complement activation, response to stress, and B cell development: IRF4, XBP1, ITM2C, MZB1, PDIA4, POU2AF1, STT3A, TNFRSF17 (Supplemental Table 1).Fig. 7: Contribution of AS03 adjuvant to gene expression changes.A Volcano plots of upregulated (red) and downregulated (blue) genes in adjuvanted G1 (IIV5/AS03 booster) vs non-adjuvanted G2 (IIV5) post boost.

We have carried out a phase 1 clinical trial to test the immunogenicity of a chimeric HA-based (cHA) group 1 universal influenza virus vaccine and showed that the cHA vaccine was safe and induced high anti-stalk antibody titers with broad activity against group 1 HAs (as reported in Nachbagauer et al.6. In particular, subjects vaccinated with adjuvanted, inactivated cHA vaccines at either prime or boost -IIV8/AS03 or IIV5/AS03, respectively- induced high anti-stalk antibody titers6. To further our understanding, we used a systems biology approach and performed longitudinal transcriptomics analyses after both prime and boost with the universal influenza virus vaccine prototype.While the transcriptional changes that occur during influenza vaccination and infection have been previously described20,21 some of the early studies were performed with microarrays (using predefined sets of immune-related transcripts), in the context of conventional subtype/strain-specific vaccines, or enriched for specific cell types22,23,24. For this study we generated global transcription profiles from whole-blood bulk RNAseq data and show that gene expression changes associated with two universal vaccine regimes G1 and G4 (IIV8/AS03-IIV5/AS03 and LAIV8-IIV5/AS03) results in induction of cell composition changes and gene programs that correlate with robust antibody responses, in this case to anti-stalk epitopes. In a previous study with conventional TIV and LAIV influenza vaccines, Nakaya et al. [PMID: 21743478] reported that TIV-induced transcriptional signatures were better correlated with antibody titers compared to LAIV, where in contrast to our study LAIV priming resulted in significant changes in gene expression. In our study priming with LAIV8 showed a modest induction (below the level of significance) for G1 and G2, with significant enrichment of inflammatory pathways by GSEA analysis. The reasons for the lack of statistical support in our study could be due to smaller group sizes, differences in vaccine dose and composition, or differences in immunogenicity of the antigens used.This study complements and adds on our previous profiling of serological and mucosal anti-stalk vaccine responses25 by dissecting the cellular composition of the immune response induced by the different vaccination schemes. As shown by Nachbagauer et al., immunogenicity for G1 and G4 (IIV8/AS03-IIV5/AS03 and LAIV8-IIV5/AS03) was similar at the protein level, however, differences in diversity observed for the Ig transcripts between these groups suggest that these two groups may have developed different Ig repertoires with yet unknown roles in response to infection.Our study also provides the transcriptional context of immune responses that lead to the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies specific to the HA stalk in the same individuals25. When we compared transcriptional responses according to vaccination groups, our data demonstrated that subjects with optimal stalk antibody responses showed an early upregulation of genes involved in innate immune response and type I IFN signaling. As expected, triggering the innate immune compartment corresponded to a robust upregulation of genes involved in B cell activation and proliferation in subjects from G4. In addition, we found a number of consistently enriched blood cell type-specific signatures associated with these processes. An early enrichment of monocytes, and different subsets of dendritic cell (DC) cells was especially marked on day 3 reflecting innate immune activation, while cell type composition transitioned to B cell responses on day 7. Importantly, our analyses suggest the transient enrichment of long-lived plasma cells in peripheral blood post vaccination, which is a desirable quality for any vaccine26,27. However, the accurate identification of cell type-signatures in our RNAseq data is subject to the accuracy of the reference data set used to deconvolute this data, and the presence of the different cell subtypes should be confirmed by alternative methods. While not surprising, these results support the inclusion of immunomodulatory components as a means to improve vaccine performance and even in to reinforce mucosal immunity28,29,30. Adjuvanted-vaccine recipient groups were not only the ones that show significant changes in gene expression in response to vaccine administration, but we also found that differences of transcriptional programs were highly dependent on the use of the adjuvant. In particular, vaccinees boosted with IIV5/AS03 (G1) showed a unique and distinct upregulation of biological processes directly related to activation and developmental programs of the immune system when compared to IIV5 only (G2). For example, XBP1 and IRF4 were correlated with the use of the adjuvanted vaccine. These two transcription factors are essential in the differentiation of activated B cells into plasma cells31,32,33,34. XBP1, in particular, is part of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, the unfolded protein response (UPR), and well known for its role not only on B-cell expansion, maturation, and class switching of antibodies for an optimal immunoglobulin production, but also almost every immune cell type35,36,37,38. In contrast, IRF4 is essential for plasma cell survival39. The apparent differences found in the induction of such factors in the adjuvanted vaccine group compared to IIV5 only, reflects the direct activation of immune compartments at multiple cell levels by the AS03-formulated vaccines, which is likely to be related to the molecular mechanisms associated with AS03 adjuvanticity. To note, no samples were collected at day 3 post-boost, therefore some limitations have to be acknowledged on the use of adjuvant after booster.In addition, we also investigated the gene signatures associated with the magnitude of the antibody responses. This hasn’t been previously shown for universal influenza vaccines, and it is important since a stalk antibody titer of 103 and 104 can suffice to prevent and reduce the severity of influenza virus infection, respectively12,13. Importantly, the anti-stalk antibody titer after vaccination with the cHA in this trial exceeded those levels. After comparison of high (>GMR) versus low (≤GMR) responders in G4, we found that individuals with greater induction did not have an independent transcriptomic profile, but rather higher levels of early-induced signatures of inter-related biological pathways on day 3, which promoted an optimal immune response. On the other hand, levels of expression for immunoglobulin genes were similar regardless of the magnitude of the measured antibody response. Since this study was not designed to address within vaccine-group differences, differences found in the high versus low responders have to be cautiously interpreted. Nonetheless, this trend suggests that more granular analyses and fine-tuning of early responses (day 1 to 3 post-vaccination and post-booster) might be crucial to define and understand vaccine-correlates of protection. Nonetheless, both high and low responders showed specific and not generic usage of immunoglobulin transcripts such as IGHV1-69 or IGKV1-39 frequently used by stalk-binding heterosubtypic antibodies18,40,41,42. Finally, our study also allowed for the simultaneous detection of the overall transcriptional responses of immunoglobulins within the transcriptome of the vaccinated volunteers. Profiling of the Ig repertoire in G4 after vaccination showed primary and secondary responses with induction of both IgG and IgM isotypes. More importantly, different subtypes could be distinguished, with high frequency of IGHG1 and IGHG3, classically related to the higher potency of antibody-mediated functions, such as ADCC or complement activation. In contrast, IGHG2, typically related to response to bacterial infections, was not induced. Another key observation was the detection and observed enrichment of IGHA transcripts, particularly IGHA1, after boosting with IIV5/AS03 (G1) in subjects primed with LAIV. This is relevant since IgA responses were not detectable in serum or on mucosal surfaces after any of the vaccine doses and demonstrate that system biology approaches, such as transcriptomics, can provide a comprehensive picture of how the immune system responds to vaccination. Nonetheless, it is still possible that some IgA was induced, but levels were under the limit of detection of the ELISA used for quantification in this trial. On the other hand, no nasal washes samples were collected to measure IgA after LAIV8 administration. The subtle effect of priming with the LAIV is also supported by the longitudinal DEG changes at day 92 post-boost in G1 (LAIV8/IIV5-AS03). A higher number of significant DEG’s compared to baseline than to day 85 was found, indicating a concealed effect of the prime dose. Further studies will help to understand the necessary pathways that need to be triggered to induce anti-stalk antibodies after vaccination with cHA influenza vaccines in combination with different vaccine regimes. Such insight can be exploited to develop effective universal influenza virus vaccines.MethodsStudy designA randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, phase I clinical study was conducted at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (Cincinnati, OH, USA) and Duke Early Phase Clinical Research Unit (Durham, NC, USA). This clinical trial was designed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of a chimeric hemagglutinin-based vaccine approach; and its ability to elicit broadly cross-reactive antibodies against the hemagglutinin stalk domain of influenza viruses. The trial design has been previously published5,6. Briefly, 66 participants were block-randomized in each site and received LAIV8-IIV5/AS03 (Group 1, G1), LAIV8-IIV5 (Group 2, G2), SALINE-PBS (Group 3, G3), IIV8/AS03-IIV5/AS03 (Group 4, G4) or PBS-PBS (Group 5, G5). To note, LAIV8 was administered intranasal while the IIV5 and IIV5/AS03 vaccines were given intramuscularly. The Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center Institutional Review Board (IRB) served as the central IRB of record for review, approval and oversight of this study on behalf of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai IRB, Duke IRB, and PATH Research Ethics Committee. All patients provided written informed consent prior to participation. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03300050. De-identified samples were made available for this analysis (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai IRB approval #IRB-17-01779).Study participantsThe study was carried out between 10 October 2017 and 9 August 2019. General inclusion criteria were male or non-pregnant female between, 18 and 39 years at the time of the first vaccination. Exclusion criteria included the previous history of Guillain-Barré syndrome, immunosuppression, history of influenza virus vaccination within 6 months prior to study enrollment or use of any other investigational drug or vaccine other than in the present study, among others. A complete list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03300050.Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)The methods and results of antibody responses against the stalk domain of the HA protein of influenza group 1 viruses used in this study have been previously published6.RNA isolation, library preparation, and sequencingPAXgene blood samples were processed for total RNA extraction using the Agencourt RNAdvance Blood Kit (Beckman Coulter) on a BioMek FXP Laboratory Automation Workstation (Beckman Coulter) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Concentration and RNA integrity number (RIN) of isolated RNA were determined using Quant-iT™ RiboGreen™ RNA Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher) and an RNA Standard Sensitivity Kit (DNF-471, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) on a Fragment Analyzer Automated CE system (Agilent Technologies), respectively. Subsequently, RNA-seq libraries were constructed from 300 ng of total RNA using the Universal Plus mRNA-Seq kit (Tecan Genomics, San Carlos, CA, United States) in a Biomek i7 Automated Workstation (Beckman Coulter). The transcripts for ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and globin were further depleted using the AnyDeplete kit (Tecan Genomics) prior to the amplification of libraries. Library concentration was assessed fluorometrically using the Qubit dsDNA HS Kit (Thermo Fisher), and quality was assessed with the Genomic DNA 50Kb Analysis Kit (DNF-467, Agilent Technologies). Preliminary sequencing of the libraries was performed using a MiSeq system (Illumina) to confirm library quality. Deep sequencing was subsequently performed using an S2 flow cell in a NovaSeq sequencing system (Illumina) (average read depth ~30 million pairs of 2 × 95 bp reads) at the New York Genome Center.RNA-sequencing analysisIllumina’s Real-Time Analysis (RTA) software was used for base-calling and quality scoring of RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Sequencing reads were processed and mapped to the human hg38 reference genome (Release 23 GRCh38.p3) with custom analysis scripts that combine publicly available tools as described before43,44. A combined matrix of mapped paired end read raw counts (genes x samples) was then obtained with featureCounts45 and used as input for differential gene expression (DGE) analysis in R v3.6.2. Prior to DGE analysis, gene counts were normalized to fragments per kb per million reads (FPKM) with RSEM with default settings for strand-specific data46. Genes with <1 FPKM in at least 50% of samples were removed from the analysis. Next, normalization factors were estimated using the trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) method, followed by voom mean-variance transformation47 to account for differences in coverage across samples. The data were inspected for potential confounders including the variables sex, site where sample was collected, RNA extraction batch and input RNA concentration, with Limma linear modeling48. Only sex was fitted as a covariate in the final model using a per-patient block design. Pairwise comparisons of each vaccine group (G1, G2, and G4) were performed against the reference PBS group (G5) to determine changes in gene expression across different vaccination schemes. For the longitudinal comparisons each condition or sampling day was compared against the baseline reference, being day 1 when testing for expression changes after the priming dose or day 85 when testing for expression changes after the boosting dose. To determine expression differences related to the adjuvant usage at day 92 (boost), direct comparisons were performed between G1 (LAIV8/IIV5-AS03) and G2 (LAIV8/IIV5), and G1 and G5 (PBS). To determine genes with significant expression differences, Limma’s eBayes adjusted p values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method (p ≤ 0.05).Gene ontology enrichment analysisGene ontology (GO) biological process (BP), molecular function (MF), and/or cellular component (CC) enrichment analyses of differentially expressed genes were performed using the gProfileR R v0.6.8 package49. The background gene set was restricted to genes with detected expression in the filtered counts matrix. Genes ranked by log2 fold change were used as an ordered query. P values were corrected using the g:SCS algorithm to account for multiple comparisons.Gene set enrichment analysisGene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed on a rank-ordered list of the longitudinal comparisons for each vaccine group. The ranking metric used was log2(FC) × –log10(P value). The analysis was performed with the fgsea package (v.1.18.0) for R (v4.1.0) with default parameters against the Hallmark database for GOBP (version 7.5.1) [PMID: 16199517].Cell-type gene signature enrichment analysisSingle-cell immune cell expression signatures derived from healthy PBMCs16 were used for gene set enrichment analysis against the DGE lists of each comparison to infer the cellular composition of the RNA-seq signatures. Enrichments were performed using Fisher’s exact tests and using Bonferroni correction for multiple comparison (p ≤ 0.05).A second enrichment analysis was performed with the xCell method [PMID: 29141660] using xCell’s curated reference from ImmPort [PMID: 24791905] and filtered for blood cell types only (aDC, B-cells, Basophils, CD4 + memory T-cells, CD4 + naive T-cells, CD4 + T-cells, CD4 + Tcm, CD4 + Tem, CD8 + naive T-cells, CD8 + T-cells, CD8 + Tcm, CD8 + Tem, cDC, Class-switched memory B-cells, DC, Eosinophils, Erythrocytes, iDC, Macrophages, Macrophages M1, Macrophages M2, Memory B-cells, Monocytes, naive B-cells, Neutrophils, NK cells, NKT, pDC, Plasma cells, Platelets, pro B-cells, Tgd cells, Th1 cells, Th2 cells, and Tregs). The analysis was performed using xCell (v1.1.0) and the results visualized as a heatmap using heatmaply (v1.3.0) for R (v4.1.0).Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

The trials will administer Pfizer’s quadrivalent influenza vaccine (qIRV (22/23)), encoding the hemagglutinin glycoproteins of four influenza strains, and the companies’ Omicron-tailored bivalent COVID-19 vaccine that targets the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and BA.4 and BA.5 variants. Moderna is also in phase 1/2 trials with a vaccine (mRNA-1073) combining its quadrivalent influenza and original-strain COVID vaccines (mRNA-1273). Other mRNA-made jab combinations in phase 1 trials include Moderna’s influenza, COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus vaccine (mRNA-1230). Credit: Bernard Chantal / Alamy Stock PhotoPfizer and Moderna, as well as heavyweights Sanofi Pasteur, partnered with Translate Bio, and GlaxoSmithKline, working with CureVac, are also pursuing single mRNA flu vaccines. Yet mRNA-made flu shots have yet to match the efficacy of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. The upside of mRNA technology is, however, that it is substantially faster than traditional methods, such as the decades-old egg-based production, newer cell-based systems or recombinant protein vaccine production — all of which require onerous purifications. Shorter production times mean that vaccines can be made closer to the start of flu seasons than current vaccines, allowing better matching to the year’s circulating strain. mRNA technology also allows large numbers of antigens to be incorporated — Moderna announced it is investigating one-time universal flu vaccines that would also allow cheap, local manufacture.

Considering commonly used Alum and MF59 adjuvants induce tissue stress and release of endogenous danger signals to mediate their adjuvant effects, physical modalities may be used to induce tissue stress and endogenous danger signal release to enhance vaccine-induced immune responses. Furthermore, physical adjuvants are less likely to induce significant systemic adverse reactions due to their localized effects. Recently we found non-invasive radiofrequency (RF) pretreatment of the skin could significantly enhance intradermal vaccine-induced immune responses in murine models that included pandemic influenza vaccine, pre-pandemic vaccine, and influenza internal antigen vaccine. It remained to be explored whether the physical RF adjuvant (RFA) could be used to boost seasonal influenza vaccination, spare vaccine doses, and induce cross-protective immunity. This study found the physical RFA could significantly enhance seasonal influenza vaccine-induced immune responses against each viral strain and robustly enhance low-dose (nanograms) H3N2 vaccine-induced immune responses and protection in murine models. RFA also induced cross-protective immunity against heterologous and heterosubtypic influenza viruses. Further studies found heat shock protein 70 (inducible endogenous danger signal) and myeloid differentiation primary response 88 adaptor played a crucial role in dose-sparing effects of RFA. These data strongly support further development of the physical RFA to boost influenza vaccination.

Adjuvants have multifaceted roles in vaccine development, for example, enabling the development of effective vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer, inducing protective immunity in the elderly, young children, and immunocompromised populations, sparing vaccine doses to immunize more people at risk (e.g., first-responders during a pandemic), or inducing cross-protective immunity against mutated viral strains1. Considering vaccines are mainly given to healthy populations, adjuvants need to have good safety profiles before they can be approved for human use. For this reason, many powerful adjuvants, such as complete and incomplete Freund’s adjuvant, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a variety of cytokines, are not approved for human use due to their high risk to induce local or systemic adverse reactions2.Aluminum salt-based adjuvant (Alum) was first used in 1930s and has been the most widely used adjuvant in human vaccines3. Several new adjuvants were approved in the last 2–3 decades that included squalene emulsion adjuvants (MF59, AS03), Adjuvant System adjuvants (AS01, AS04), and CpG oligonucleotide (CpG) 1018 adjuvant4. Accompanied with this advance, the underlying mechanisms of vaccine adjuvants were also gradually uncovered, thanks to the increasing understanding on how the adaptive immune systems are activated in the absence of pathogen infections5,6. It was found endogenous danger signals released under specific tissue stress could activate innate immune systems to support the adaptive immunity5,6. Previously it was believed mainly foreign materials, such as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), could activate innate immune systems to support the adaptive immunity5,6.Endogenous danger signals are diverse types of small chemicals and macromolecules that exist in physiological conditions and can release under tissue stress to activate innate immune systems7. Common endogenous danger signals include uric acid, ATP, double-strand DNA (dsDNA), and heat shock proteins (HSPs)7. Uric acid, ATP, and dsDNA exist in physiological conditions in the cytosol, mitochondria, or cell nucleus7. HSPs exist in diverse cellular compartments (e.g., cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria) or induced by a variety of stimuli not limited to heat shock7,8. Extracellular release of these molecules activates innate immune systems and sometimes is linked to pathological mechanisms of autoimmune diseases, such as arthritis and gout9. Several danger signals have been found to mediate adjuvant effects of Alum and MF59. Both adjuvants have no specific cellular receptors to mediate their adjuvant effects. Alum adjuvant was once thought to retain antigens at local injection sites to mediate its adjuvant effects. Later it was found the ‘antigen depot’ was not critical to alum adjuvant effects since removal of the injection site as early as 2 h had no appreciable effects on antigen-specific T and B cell responses10. Both adjuvants were found to induce tissue stress, such as cell deaths and apoptosis, at local injection site or in draining lymph nodes11,12. Kool et al. found Alum adjuvant could induce uric acid release from Alum-injected tissues and activate NLRP3 inflammasome to mediate local inflammatory responses13. ATP was found to release extracellularly from MF59-injected tissues and play a crucial role in its adjuvant effects14. These studies indicated induction of tissue stress and release of endogenous danger signals might enhance vaccine-induced immune responses.Radiofrequency (RF) is highly alternating electromagnetic waves and can be used to heat tissue by induction of oscillation of water molecules within the tissue. RF has been broadly used in skin resurfacing by generation of thermal heating to cause collagen denaturation and stimulate neo-collagen synthesis15. RF has been also used to ablate tumor tissues in tumor therapy or nerve fibers in pain management16,17. Recently, we explored non-invasive RF treatment of the skin to induce thermal stress to enhance intradermal (ID) vaccine-induced immune responses. We found the physical RF adjuvant (RFA) showed potent adjuvant effects to boost influenza pandemic 2009 H1N1, split-virion H5N1, and recombinant nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix protein 1 (M1) vaccination in murine models18,19,20. RFA was further found to elicit transient low-level local inflammation, while chemical adjuvants (Alum, AddaVax, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL)) induced intense and persistent local inflammation20. RFA was also less likely to induce systemic or long-term side effects due to its well-controlled local effects and the physical nature of the adjuvant. Despite these promising results, it remained to be explored whether RFA could enhance seasonal influenza vaccination, spare vaccine doses, and induce cross-protective immunity. This study explored the various adjuvant effects of RFA on influenza vaccination in murine models.Materials and methodsReagentsMonovalent 2009 H1N1 influenza (pdm09) vaccine (NR-20083), trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV, 2011–2012) (NR-36747), and influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) viruses (NR-28652, abbreviated as PR8) were obtained from BEI Resources (Manassas, VA). Influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) viruses (FR-201), A/Victoria/210/2009 X-187 (H3N2) viruses (FR-644), influenza B/Brisbane/60/2008 viruses (Victoria Lineage) (FR-177), and recombinant hemagglutinin antigen (rHA) of influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) (FR-559) were obtained from International Reagent Resource (IRR, Manassas, VA). AddaVax adjuvant was purchased from Invivogen (vac-adx-10, San Diego, CA). Chicken red blood cells (RBCs) (10100768) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA).MiceC57BL/6 and BALB/c mice (6–8 weeks old, male) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). MyD88 knockout (KO) mice (009088) were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). HSP70 KO mice (cryo-preserved, 030411-MU) were ordered from Mutant Mouse Resource & Research Centers (MMRRC) at University of Missouri. One litter of heterologous HSP70 mice were received and self-bred to obtain HSP70 WT and HSP70 KO mice for self-breeding to obtain sufficient mice for use in this study. Animals were housed in animal facilities of the University of Rhode Island (URI) and anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of Ketamine (80 mg/kg) and Xylazine (10 mg/kg) for hair removal, RF treatment, and immunization. Animal experiments involving influenza viruses were conducted in animal biosafety level 2 (ABSL2) facility of URI. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of URI and conducted in accordance with National and Institutional Guidelines and Regulations. Animal experiments were reported in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines.RF deviceA cosmetic fractional bipolar RF device of ~ 1 MHz (Norlanya Technology Co., Hong Kong, China) equipped with 12 × 12 array of microelectrodes in 2 × 2 cm2 area was used. This device has three energy settings (low, medium, high) and high-energy setting was used in this study to induce significant tissue stress in 1–2 min. For RF treatment, a thin layer of ultrasound coupling medium was applied on the skin surface as recommended by the manufacturer and RF device was then firmly pressed to allow treatment tips to have a close contact with skin surface.ImmunizationHair on the lateral back skin of mice was removed one day before experiment by clipping and application of hair-removal lotion. Next day, hair-removed skin was exposed to RF or sham treatment followed by ID injection of vaccine into RF- or sham-treated skin as in our previous reports18,19,20. In chemical adjuvant groups, mice were intramuscularly injected with the same amount of vaccine in the presence of AddaVax (50%, vol/vol) except otherwise specified.Inactivated H3N2 split vaccineFor preparation of a monovalent split-virion H3N2 vaccine, H3N2 viruses (A/Philippines/2/82) were expanded in 10-day-old embryonated hen’s eggs and then inactivated by treating with 1% neutral formalin. The inactivated H3N2 viruses were harvested by ultracentrifugation and then treated with 1% Triton X-100 to disrupt virus particles followed by dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as in our prior report21. Detergent-compatible protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) was used to determine protein concentration of the split-virion H3N2 vaccine. Hemagglutinin antigen (HA) content is estimated to be approximately 29–30% of total influenza virion proteins22,23.Influenza viral challengeH3N2 viruses (A/Philippines/2/82) were expanded in 10-day-old embryonated hen’s eggs and the allantoic fluid was collected for use in challenge studies. Fifty percent lethal dose (LD50) in mice was determined following a well-established method24. Mouse-adapted pdm09 viruses and influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 H1N1 (PR8) viruses were prepared as in our prior reports20,25,26. Mice were intranasally challenged with different doses of H3N2, pdm09, or PR8 viruses under anesthesia. Mouse body weight and survival were monitored daily for 14 days. The mice were euthanized and considered dead if their body weight loss was more than 25%.HI titerSerum hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer was measured as in our previous report25. In brief, serum samples were incubated with receptor-destroying enzyme II, heat inactivated, and then incubated with chicken RBCs to remove non-specific binding. Serum samples were then subjected to two-fold serial dilutions and incubated with four hemagglutinating units of influenza viruses. Viruses were propagated in 9–11-day embryonic eggs for use in this study. Chicken RBCs were added and HI titer was determined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that completely inhibited agglutination of chicken RBCs.ELISA antibody titerSerum antibody titer was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as in our previous report25. In brief, 96-well ELISA plates were coated with 2 µg/ml rHA at 4 °C overnight. After blocking with 5% non-fat milk, two-fold serial dilutions of immune sera were added and incubated at room temperature for 90 min. After washing in PBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies (1:2500, NA931, GE Healthcare Life Sciences) were added and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After washing in PBST, TMB substrates were added and reactions were then stopped by addition of 3 N H2SO4. Optical absorbance (OD450nm) was determined using a microplate reader (Molecular Device). Serum antibody titer was defined as the reciprocal dilution factor that resulted in OD450nm ~ 3 times higher than the background values.StatisticsValues were expressed as Mean ± SEM (standard error of the mean). Student’s t-test was used to analyze differences between groups and one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test was used to compare differences for more than 2 groups except otherwise specified. Two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test was used to compare body weight difference at different time points between groups except otherwise specified. Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test with Bonferroni correction was used to compare differences of survival between groups. P value was calculated by PRISM software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA) and considered significant if it was less than 0.05.ResultsRFA boosts seasonal influenza vaccinationOur previous studies found the physical RFA could enhance the efficacy of influenza pandemic 2009 H1N1 vaccine, split virion H5N1 vaccine, and intracellular NP/M1 vaccine18,19,20. It remained to be explored whether RFA was also effective to boost seasonal influenza vaccination. Here, we used TIV (2011–2012) comprised of influenza A/California/07/2009 X-179A H1N1 (pdm09), A/Victoria/210/2009 X-187 H3N2 (an A/Perth/16/2009-like virus), and B/Brisbane/60/2008 as an example to explore RFA effects in murine models. Briefly, mice were subjected to RFA or sham treatment followed by ID injection of TIV into RF or sham-treated skin. Serum HI titer was measured three weeks later. As shown in Fig. 1, RFA significantly increased serum HI titer against all viral strains. RFA increased serum HI titer against influenza A H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B viruses by 3.6, 6.4, 1.75 folds, respectively (Fig. 1). This result indicated RFA could increase TIV-induced HI titer against each viral strain though to different extents.Figure 1RFA enhances TIV-induced HI titer. C57BL/6 mice were subjected to RFA or sham treatment followed by ID injection of 20 µl TIV (equivalent to 0.3 µg HA/strain) into RF or sham-treated skin. Serum HI titer against each viral strain was measured three weeks later. One-tailed student’s t-test was used to compare differences between RFA and sham groups. n = 4. *p < 0.05; ***p < 0.001.Full size imageRFA enhances H3N2 vaccinationSeasonal influenza vaccines were found to have a lower effectiveness against H3N2 strain post the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic27. H3N2 strain also has a long-term antigenic mutation rate 17 times higher than the pdm09 H1N1 strain and 5–6 times higher than the type B strain27. Thus, adjuvants effective to boost H3N2 vaccination are highly desired. The above studies found RFA was highly effective to enhance TIV-induced HI titer against H3N2 strain. Next, a monovalent split-virion H3N2 vaccine (A/Philippines/2/82) was used to confirm the above finding and also explore the protection against viral challenges. In addition, MF59-mimetic AddaVax adjuvant was included for comparison. In brief, mice were subjected to RF or sham treatment followed by ID delivery of H3N2 vaccine into RF or sham-treated skin or intramuscularly immunized with the same vaccine dose in the presence of AddaVax adjuvant or left non-immunized. AddaVax adjuvant was delivered into the muscle due to its high risk to induce significant skin reactions following ID delivery. As shown in Fig. 2A, ID immunization in the presence of RFA induced a similar HI titer to that induced by intramuscular (IM) immunization in the presence of AddaVax adjuvant. Serum HI titers in RFA/ID and AddaVax/IM groups were significantly higher than that in sham/ID group (Fig. 2A). Following lethal viral challenges, mice in NI and sham/ID groups lost more than 20% body weight and mice in RFA/ID and AddaVax/IM groups lost less than 10% body weight (Fig. 2B). Mice in RFA/ID and AddaVax/IM groups recovered to their original body weights on day 10 after challenge (Fig. 2B). All mice died in NI group and 7 out of 8 mice died in sham/ID group, while all mice survived in RFA/ID and AddaVax/IM groups (Fig. 2C). This study confirmed the high potency of RFA to boost H3N2 vaccination.Figure 2RFA boosts monovalent H3N2 vaccination. BALB/c mice were subjected to RF or sham treatment followed by ID delivery of 0.1 µg H3N2 vaccine (HA equivalent) into RF or sham-treated skin or intramuscularly injected with the same vaccine dose in the presence of AddaVax or left non-immunized (NI). Serum HI titer was measured 3 weeks later and shown in (A). Mice were then challenged with a lethal dose of homologous H3N2 viruses (50 × LD50). Body weight change (B) and survival (C) were monitored daily for 14 days. n = 8–9. One-way ANOVA with Dunn’s multiple comparison test was used to compare differences among groups in (A). Log-rank test with Bonferroni correction was used to compare differences of survival between NI and other groups or otherwise specified in (C). *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001. NS not significant.Full size imageSignificant dose-sparing effects of RFA on H3N2 vaccinationOur previous study found reduction of pdm09 vaccine dose from 0.3 to 0.06 µg in the presence of RFA did not significantly reduce vaccine efficacy20, hinting potent dose-sparing effects of RFA on pdm09 vaccination. Here, we explored dose-sparing effects of RFA on H3N2 vaccination. In the first experiment, mice were subjected to ID delivery of 0.3 µg H3N2 vaccine or reducing H3N2 vaccine doses till 0.025 µg in the presence of RFA. As shown in Fig. 3A, H3N2 vaccine at all tested doses in the presence of RFA induced at least the same HI titer as H3N2 vaccine alone at 0.3 µg dose. Interestingly, H3N2 vaccine at 0.1 µg dose in the presence of RFA elicited significantly higher serum HI titer than H3N2 vaccine alone at 0.3 µg dose. Serum anti-H3N2 vaccine IgG titer showed the same trend. H3N2 vaccine of all doses in the presence of RFA elicited at least the same levels of anti-H3N2 IgG titer as compared to H3N2 vaccine alone at 0.3 µg dose (Fig. 3B). H3N2 vaccine at 0.1 µg dose in the presence of RFA elicited significantly higher anti-H3N2 IgG titer than H3N2 vaccine alone at 0.3 µg dose (Fig. 3B). After lethal viral challenges, mice in RFA groups showed significantly slower body weight loss as compared to that in vaccine alone group (Fig. 3C). Mice in vaccine alone group lost a maximum of 20% body weight, while that in RFA groups lost less than 10% body weight (Fig. 3C). The majority of the mice in RFA groups recovered to their original body weights on day 10, while mice in vaccine alone group only recovered to 96% of their original body weights at the end of the study (day 14) (Fig. 3C). All mice in RFA groups and 80% mice in vaccine alone group survived the challenge, while all mice in NI group succumbed to the challenge (Fig. 3D).Figure 3Dose-sparing effects of RFA in vaccine dose range (0.3–0.025 µg). BALB/c mice were intradermally injected with 0.3 µg H3N2 vaccine or subjected to RF treatment followed by ID injection of H3N2 vaccine of reducing doses (0.3–0.025 µg). Serum HI (A) and IgG titers (B) were measured three weeks later. Mice were challenged with 50 × LD50 of H3N2 viruses four weeks after immunization. Body weight change (C) and survival (D) were monitored daily for 14 days. n = 5. One-way ANOVA with Dunn’s multiple comparison test was used to compare differences among groups in (A) and (B). Two-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test was used to compared differences between vaccine alone and RFA groups in (C). Log-rank test with Bonferroni correction was used to compare differences of survival between NI and other groups or otherwise specified in (D). *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001. NS not significant.Full size imageIn the second experiment, H3N2 vaccine doses were further reduced to explore the least vaccine dose in the presence of RFA to elicit similar protection to H3N2 vaccine alone at 0.3 µg dose. IM immunization of H3N2 vaccine at 0.05 µg dose in the presence of AddaVax was included for comparison. As shown in Fig. 4A, serum HI titer showed no significant difference among groups. Serum anti-H3N2 IgG titer showed a slightly different trend. There was still no significant difference in serum anti-H3N2 IgG titer between vaccine alone and other groups (Fig. 4B). However, serum anti-H3N2 IgG titer in RFA/0.01 µg group was significantly higher than that in RFA/0.0025 µg and RFA/0.001 µg groups (Fig. 4B). Serum anti-H3N2 IgG titer in AddaVax/0.05 µg was also significantly higher than that in RFA/0.0025 µg group (Fig. 4B). Following lethal viral challenges, mice in RFA/0.01 µg group showed a slower rate of body weight loss than that in vaccine alone group (Fig. 4C), hinting better protection elicited by 0.01 µg vaccine in the presence of RFA. In contrast, mice in RFA/0.0025 µg and RFA/0.001 µg groups showed more rapid body weight loss than that in vaccine alone group (Fig. 4C), hinting inferior protection induced by 0.0025 and 0.001 µg vaccine in the presence of RFA. Similar protection was observed between RFA/0.01 µg and AddaVax/0.05 µg groups, while better protection was observed in AddaVax/0.05 µg group than 0.3 µg vaccine alone group (Fig. 4C). Consistent with body weight data, all mice survived in RFA/0.01 µg and AddaVax/0.05 µg groups and 80% mice survived in vaccine alone group, while only 20% mice survived in RFA/0.0025 µg and all mice died in RFA/0.001 µg group (Fig. 4D). This study indicated 0.01 µg or 10 ng H3N2 vaccine (HA equivalent) could elicit significant protection in the presence of RFA, hinting potent dose-sparing effects of RFA on H3N2 vaccination.Figure 4Dose-sparing effects of RFA in vaccine dose range (0.01–0.001 µg). BALB/c mice were intradermally injected with 0.3 µg H3N2 vaccine or subjected to RF treatment followed by ID injection of H3N2 vaccine of further reducing doses (0.01–0.001 µg). Serum HI (A) and IgG titers (B) were measured three weeks later. Mice were challenged with 50 × LD50 of H3N2 viruses four weeks after immunization. Body weight change (C) and survival (D) were monitored daily for 14 days. n = 5. One-way ANOVA with Dunn’s multiple comparison test was used to compare differences among groups in (A) and (B). Two-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test was used to compare differences between vaccine alone and other groups in (C). Log-rank test with Bonferroni correction was used to compare differences of survival between RFA/0.001µg and other groups except otherwise specified in (D). *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001. NS not significant.Full size imageCrucial roles of HSP70 and MyD88 in dose-sparing effects of RFAOur previous studies found RFA could induce HSP70 release and MyD88 played a crucial role in RFA effects to boost pdm09 vaccination20. It remained to be explored whether the above observed potent dose-sparing effects of RFA also depended on HSP70 or MyD88. To explore this, wild type (WT), HSP70 KO, and MyD88 KO mice were intradermally immunized with 0.3 µg H3N2 vaccine or 0.01 µg H3N2 vaccine in the presence of RFA. Serum HI titer was measured 3 weeks later. As shown in Fig. 5A, 0.01 µg vaccine in the presence of RFA elicited similar levels of HI titers to 0.3 µg vaccine alone in WT, HSP70 KO, and MyD88 KO mice. After lethal viral challenges, a similar rate of body weight loss was observed between the two groups in WT, HSP70 KO, or MyD88 KO mice (Fig. 5B). Yet, we observed markedly reduced survival in RFA group in HSP70 KO and MyD88 KO mice (Fig. 5C). In more detail, 2 out of 5 mice survived in vaccine alone group and 3 out of 5 mice survived in RFA group in WT mice (Table 1). Two out of 4 mice survived in vaccine alone group and only one of 4 mice survived in RFA group in HSP70 KO mice (Table 1). In MyD88 KO mice, 4 out of 6 mice survived in vaccine alone group, while only one of 6 mice survived in RFA group (Table 1). Markedly reduced survival of mice in RFA group in HSP70 KO (25%) and MyD88 KO mice (17%) as compared to WT mice (60%) hinted importance of HSP70 and MyD88 in dose-sparing effects of RFA. To be noted, slightly increased survival was observed in vaccine alone groups in HSP70 KO (50%) and MyD88 KO mice (67%) when compared to WT mice (40%) though such a difference was not statistically significant.Figure 5Crucial roles of HSP70 and MyD88 in dose-sparing effects of RFA. WT (C57BL/6), HSP70 KO, and MyD88 KO mice were intradermally injected with 0.3 µg H3N2 vaccine or subjected to RF treatment followed by ID injection of H3N2 vaccine at 0.01 µg dose. Serum HI titers were measured three weeks later (A). Mice were challenged with 50 × LD50 of H3N2 viruses four weeks after immunization. Body weight change (B) and survival (C) were monitored daily for 14 days. n = 5 for WT, n = 4 for HSP70 KO, n = 6 for MyD88 KO. Two-tailed student’s t-test was used to compare differences in (A). Two-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test was used to compare differences between groups at different time points in (B). Log-rank test with Bonferroni correction was used to compare differences of survival between groups in (C). No significant difference was found in all comparisons in A-C. Full size imageTable 1 Summary of survival in WT and KO mice.Full size tableCross-protective immunity induced by RFASeasonal influenza vaccines usually lack the ability to induce cross-protective immunity. Incorporation of vaccine adjuvants may broaden vaccine-induced immune responses. Next, we explored whether influenza vaccination in the presence of RFA could induce cross-protective immunity. Mice were subjected to RF or sham treatment followed by ID injection of 0.3 µg pdm09 vaccine into RF or sham-treated skin. Immunization was repeated 3 weeks later. As shown in Fig. 6A, ID immunization in the presence of RFA increased serum HI titer by ~ 19 folds as compared to ID immunization alone. RFA also significantly increased serum anti-rHA IgG titer by over 4 folds (Fig. 6B). We also measured HI titer against heterologous PR8 and heterosubtypic H3N2 viruses and found only 1–2 serum samples in RFA group had detectable HI titers, which showed no significant difference from that in sham group (data not shown).Figure 6RFA enhances pdm09 vaccine-induced antibody responses. BALB/c mice were subjected to RF or sham treatment followed by ID delivery of 0.3 µg pdm09 vaccine into RF or sham-treated skin. Immunization was repeated 3 weeks later. Serum HI titer (A) and anti-rHA IgG titer (B) were measured 3 weeks after boost. Two-tailed student’s t-test was used to compare differences between groups. n = 14. **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.Full size imageMice were then randomly divided into two groups and intranasally challenged with 5 × LD50 of heterologous PR8 viruses or 2 × LD50 of heterosubtypic H3N2 viruses. As shown in Fig. 7A, mice in RFA group showed significantly less body weight loss from day 9 after PR8 viral challenge than mice in sham group. Mice in sham group showed significantly less body weight loss only on day 14 when compared to mice in NI group (Fig. 7A). Consistently, 5 out of 7 mice in RFA group survived PR8 viral challenge, while 2 in 7 mice in sham group and one in 4 mice in NI group survived PR8 viral challenge (Fig. 7B). This study indicated pdm09 vaccine in the presence of RFA induced cross-protective immunity against heterologous PR8 viruses. Following heterosubtypic H3N2 viral challenges, mice in sham group showed reduced body weight loss and mice in RFA group showed more significantly reduced body weight loss as compared to mice in NI group (Fig. 7C). Three out of 4 mice survived in NI group and all mice survived in sham and RFA groups (Fig. 7D). This result indicated pdm09 vaccine in the presence of RFA also elicited cross-protective immunity against heterosubtypic H3N2 viruses.Figure 7Induction of cross-protection by RFA. (A,B) BALB/c mice were challenged with 5 × LD50 of PR8 viruses. Body weight (A) and survival (B) were monitored daily for 14 days. (C,D) BALB/c mice were challenged with 2 × LD50 of H3N2 viruses. Body weight change (C) and survival (D) were monitored daily for 14 days. n = 4 for NI; n = 7 for sham and RFA. Two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-test was used to compare body weight differences between sham and other groups at different time points in (A) and (C). *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.Full size imageDiscussionThis study found RFA had potent adjuvant effects to boost seasonal influenza vaccination in murine models. Our prior studies found RFA could significantly boost pdm09, H5N1, and recombinant NP/M1 vaccination. Considering seasonal influenza vaccines post 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic contain pdm09 or pdm09-like viruses, RFA is expected to similarly enhance seasonal influenza vaccine efficacy against H1N1 viral strains. However, it remained to be explored whether RFA could similarly enhance seasonal influenza vaccine efficacy against H3N2 and type B viral strains. This study showed RFA could enhance seasonal influenza vaccine efficacy against all vaccine viral strains (H1N1, H3N2, type B) though to different extents. RFA induced a similar fold increase of serum HI titer against H1N1 viral strain in this study as compared to our prior study (3.6 vs. 3.44)20. Interestingly, RFA more significantly enhanced serum HI titer against H3N2 strain (6.4-fold increase) and less significantly against type B virus (1.75-fold increase). Similar findings were also found when MF59 adjuvant was explored to boost seasonal influenza vaccination. MF59 adjuvant most significantly enhanced HI titer against H3N2 strain and least significantly against type B strain in young children and old adults28,29. The underlying reason of the different adjuvant effects on diverse viral strains remained to be explored.One question in physical adjuvant development is their relative potency to chemical adjuvants. This study compared RFA and MF59-like AddaVax adjuvant to boost H3N2 vaccination and results showed comparable HI titer and similar protection between RFA/ID and AddaVax/IM groups. This result recapitulated our prior finding that ID immunization of 0.3 µg pdm09 vaccine in the presence of RFA elicit similar HI titer and protection to IM immunization of the same dose of pdm09 vaccine in the presence of AddaVax adjuvant20. AddaVax was intramuscularly delivered in these studies due to its risk to induce significant local reactions following ID delivery.Our study discovered robust dose-sparing effects of RFA on monovalent H3N2 vaccination. Ten nanograms of H3N2 vaccine in the presence of RFA elicited better immune responses and protection than 0.3 µg H3N2 vaccine alone. Reduction of vaccine dose to 2.5 ng with RFA elicited weaker immune responses and protection than 0.3 µg H3N2 vaccine alone. This indicates the least H3N2 vaccine dose that RFA is effective to boost is between 2.5 and 10 ng. IM immunization of H3N2 vaccine at 0.05 µg dose in the presence of AddaVax elicited similar immune responses and protection to ID immunization of H3N2 vaccine at 10 ng dose in the presence of RFA. Our prior study found RFA could effectively enhance pdm09 vaccination at 0.06 µg dose, while AddaVax was ineffective at this low dose20. These findings indicated RFA had potent dose-sparing effects, superior or at least similar to AddaVax adjuvant. A literature search found rarely nanogram doses of vaccines elicited potent immune responses and protection. One study prepared poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles coated with PEGylated phospholipid bilayers with MPL further incorporated in the lipid bilayer for conjugation of vaccine antigens30. Using this sophisticated system, 2.5 ng ovalbumin was found to induce potent antibody responses in murine models, while at such a low antigen dose Alum and MPL failed to elicit potent immune responses30. In another study, AS03B but not AS03A could significantly enhance 3 ng influenza A/Uruguay/716/2007 H3N2 vaccination after one immunization in murine models31. Three ng remained the lowest antigen dose that could elicit potent immune responses in the presence of AS03 adjuvant in this study31. The ability of RFA to effectively enhance nanogram doses of H3N2 vaccine-induced immune responses and protection hinted its highly potent dose-sparing effects.Our current study found HSP70 and MyD88 played a crucial role in dose-sparing effects of RFA. Although no significant difference in HI titer, body weight loss, or survival was found between RFA/0.01 µg and 0.3 µg vaccine groups in WT, HSP70 KO, or MyD88 KO mice, significantly reduced survival in RFA/0.01 µg group in HSP70 KO and MyD88 KO mice hinted their crucial role in dose-sparing effects of RFA. It remained to be explored whether HSP70 also played a crucial role in immune-enhancing effects of RFA, which is highly likely considering HSP70 can be released extracellularly with immune-potentiating functions32,33. Our prior study and this study found crucial roles of MyD88 in immune-enhancing and dose-sparing effects of RFA20. It remained to be explored how RFA stimulated MyD88 pathway due toits physical nature. One possible explanation is RFA stimulates release of endogenous danger signals to indirectly activate MyD88 pathway. It remained to be explored whether HSP70 served as the endogenous danger signal that activated MyD88 pathway.RFA was further found to assist pdm09 vaccine to induce cross-protective immunity. As compared to pdm09 vaccine alone, pdm09 vaccine in the presence of RFA conferred better protection against heterologous PR8 viral challenges and slightly better protection against heterosubtypic H3N2 viral challenges. These results indicated RFA elicited more potent heterologous protection than heterosubtypic protection in murine models, which could be explained by higher HA homology between heterologous H1N1 strains than between heterosubtypic strains (H1N1 and H3N2). Induction of cross-protective immunity is highly desired for influenza vaccination due to the constant mutation of influenza viruses, which requires the current influenza vaccines to be updated annually. Regarding cross-protective mechanisms, it might be due to the induction of cross-reactive cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses in the absence of significant HI titers elicited against heterologous or heterosubtypic viral strains (data not shown). In support, our prior studies found RFA could elicit potent CTL responses against OVA, rHA, and NP/M118,20.Our current study strongly supports further development of RFA to boost influenza vaccination. Prior to RFA, various types of laser were explored to boost ID vaccination. Laser adjuvants emit green or near-infrared light on a small area of the skin to enhance dendritic cell (DC) migration or transportation to draining lymph nodes to enhance ID vaccine-induced immune responses34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42. Non-ablative fractional laser (NAFL) was also explored to boost ID vaccination43,44. NAFL induces microscopic skin damage and was found to recruit plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) and induce dsDNA release to mediate its adjuvant effects43,45. Prior to laser adjuvants, low-frequency sonophoresis (LFS) was found to activate epidermal Langerhans cells and at the same time breach the barrier function of the skin to facilitate transcutaneous immunization46. To our knowledge, this is the first report that a physical adjuvant (RFA) elicits such a potent dose-sparing effect and also induces cross-protective immunity against influenza vaccination. RFA was also highly potent and could significantly enhance ID pdm09 and H3N2 vaccine-induced immune responses and protection to a similar extent to that induced by IM vaccination in the presence of MF59-like AddaVax adjuvant.

[+] (Photo: Getty)getty It’s already been a “ruff” flu season, in more ways than one. Humans across the U.S. have been dealing with a big surge in influenza cases. That’s after Covid-19 precautions over the past two Fall and Winters had seemingly put flu seasons on pause. And now those with paws, namely dogs, have been suffering from surges in the flu as well, specifically the dog flu. Veterinarians have been reporting outbreaks of such illnesses in various parts of the U.S. such as Texas and California, according to the following KRON news segment: Yeah, it’s been a dog-infect-dog world or at least country with many dogs transmitting a highly contagious H3N2 strain of the canine influenza virus (CIV) to each other. If you are human, this CIV strain is highly unlikely to infect you and get you sick. However, if you happen to have a tail, a strong urge to sniff other dogs’ butts, and a tendency to chase after sticks when someone throws them, catching this CIV strain can leave you as one sick puppy or one sick adult dog, depending on how old you happen to be. If you are not sure whether or not you are a dog, see your doctor or perhaps your veterinarian as soon as possible. It will be important to know to gauge of getting sick with the dog flu and for other aspects of your life. CIVs are similar to human influenza viruses in many ways. A dog sick with canine influenza can end up transmitting the virus to others via direct contact, contaminating surfaces with the virus, or dispersing virus-laden respiratory droplets into the air via coughing, barking, or singing. Since dogs don’t tend to wear face masks or cough into their elbows, just one dog in a kennel or a doggie day care center can quickly get many other dogs infected. Since the dog flu may not be as common as the human flu and many dogs may not be vaccinated against the CIV, many dogs may be very susceptible to catching the virus. Like the human flu, you don’t have to have symptoms to be contagious. According to the American Veterinary Association, around 20% of dogs with the dog flu don’t show any symptoms. The exact number is unclear since dogs don’t tend to say, “dude, not feeling well.” Symptoms tend to appear two- to four- days after the initial infection. Common symptoms include fevers, a persistent cough including something called “kennel cough,” a thick discharge from the nose, discharge from the eyes, and a reduced appetite. The dog flu can also leave you dog-tired if you are a dog. Or perhaps dogs may use the term human-tired for lethargy. Nonetheless, most dogs do fully recover from such symptoms in about two to three weeks. There is the risk, though, of infections progressing to even more severe illness such as pneumonia, especially when secondary bacteria infections occur. The dog flu can lead to death, but that happens in less than 10% of all cases. MORE FROMFORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesByAmy DaniseEditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansByAmy DaniseEditor Why has dog flu been on the rise? Well, dogs could blame humans. After all, humans have been responsible for many of the world’s problems such as pollution and Dancing with the Stars. It’s not as if a greater number of dogs in 2022 decided to say, “screw Covid-19 precautions, I’m exercising my freedom to exhale on other people” and increase their mixing and mingling. The answer to the question, “who let the dogs out or in” is frequently humans. As more and more people have been traveling and returning to in-person work in 2022, more and more dogs have found themselves in kennels and doggie day care centers. More dogs have been traveling too, but not because they’ve been worried about losing their frequent flier mileage or trying to exact “revenge travel” on who knows whom. No, dogs’ human owners have been the ones more likely to travel more this year than the previous two years. And where their human owners go, dogs tend to go. Because why wouldn’t a dog want to go through airport security. Check with your veterinarian to see if you are a dog and should consider getting vaccinated against ... [+] the canine influenza virus. (Photo: Getty)getty So how do you avoid the dog flu if you are indeed a dog? Well, you could stay away from other dogs who may be infected. Any dog who is infected with the CIV should remain isolated throughout the duration of the illness. But you know how good dogs are at declaring that they have the dog flu and keeping themselves isolated. You can also get vaccinated against the H3N8 and H3N2 strains of CIV if you are a dog. This will be especially important if you happen to be a dog who frequents dog parks, dog kennels, dog raves, the local Dogbucks, or any other doggie gathering place. The vaccine isn’t 100 percent effective at preventing the dog flu so it will be important to still be careful around other dogs. Don’t just go and sniff any other dog’s butt. But the vaccine can reduce your risk of catching the virus, “fur” real, regardless of what anti-vaccination nonsense you may have heard on Tailbook, Barker or whatever social media platform dogs tend to use. Again, if you are human, don’t worry about catching the dog flu yourself. It’s true that this currently circulating H3N2 CIV strain used to be for the birds but over time acquired the ability to infect dogs. However, there is no evidence that this particular virus has mutated to the point that it can “paws-ibly” infect humans. With the current surges in Covid-19, the flu, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections and many people avoiding face mask wearing like dogs avoid chili peppers, humans already have plenty of other respiratory viruses hounding them this Holiday season.

But, how do you tell for sure you have the flu and not another illness that has similar symptoms to the flu? Is there a definitive test you can take that will tell you if what you're feeling is the flu? If you experience symptoms such as cough, fever, sore throat, or body aches, reach out to a healthcare provider to find out if you should be tested for the flu – especially if you’re at a higher risk of developing complications.A healthcare provider may order a rapid test, a lab test, or a combination COVID-19/flu test, depending on your symptoms and text availability.If you test positive, a healthcare provider will decide if you need treatment and offer treatment options.

Between 2010 and 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that the flu resulted in 9 million to 41 million flu illnesses each year—and even that is just an estimate. The truth is, the CDC doesn't know exactly how many people get the flu annually, for a variety of reasons—mainly because many people don't seek medical care for flu symptoms, and even when they do seek treatment, healthcare providers may not test for the flu because it doesn't change how a person is treated. That, and other factors like people who seek care when their flu can no longer be detected through a flu test, contribute to the fact that even the data we have may underrepresent the true burden of flu in the US on any given year. A flu test is the only real way to know whether or not you or a loved one experiencing flu-like symptoms actually has the flu—and it can be a powerful tool, when reported, to help experts understand just how bad any given flu season is affecting the population. But getting tested for the flu can be kind of intimidating—no one really wants to get a swab up their nose, after all. Here's what you need to know about flu tests, including who typically needs one, how long it takes to get results back, and what to do if you test positive for influenza. Getty Images How Do You Know if You Need a Flu Test? Your need for a flu test will come down to the symptoms you present to your healthcare provider, and how they decide to diagnose those symptoms. The most common signs and symptoms of the flu include: Fever and chills (note: not everyone with flu will have a fever)CoughSore throatRunny or stuffy noseMuscle or body achesHeadacheFatigueVomiting and diarrhea (this is usually more common in children) You may notice that the symptoms listed above are also very common to those seen with COVID-19. If if your healthcare provider decides to test for COVID-19 first, and it comes back negative, they may move on to a flu test, said Robert L. Murphy, MD, a professor of infectious diseases at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Most people don't actually need a flu test, but some of the reasons a healthcare provider might do a flu test are: The person has risk factors for flu complicationsThere's a local flu outbreak that the health department is monitoringThe infected person has close contact with others who have a high risk of complications from the flu Are There Different Types of Flu Tests? Yes, there are several types of flu tests and each requires either a nasal swab—where a provider swipes the inside of your nose—or a throat swab, said Cassandra Pierre, MD, MPH, an infectious disease physician at Boston Medical Center. Even more specifically, some tests go further back in the nose, while the rapid test only goes right inside, said Anjali Mahoney, MD, MPH, a family medicine specialist with Keck Medicine of USC. Rapid Tests There are several different ways to test for influenza and some tests are available at a healthcare provider's office or pharmacy. The most common test for the flu is called a "rapid influenza diagnostic test" (RIDT). These RIDTs detect the part of the virus that stimulates an immune response, known as an antigen. Another type of flu test, called a "rapid molecular assay," detects the actual genetic material of the flu virus. Both of these tests are termed "rapid" because they can provide results in 10 to 15 minutes (RIDTs) or 15 to 20 minutes (rapid molecular assays). Tests in Hospitals or Public Laboratories Even more accurate than RIDTs and rapid molecular assays are the tests most often found in hospitals or public health laboratories (those places have more specialized labs than your average urgent care practice or healthcare provider's office). Those tests are known as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, viral cultures, or immunofluorescence assays. These results also take a little longer—up to several hours. While no test is 100% accurate, Dr. Pierre said flu tests have a high degree of sensitivity and specificity, meaning they're likely to show a positive result if you're infected and a negative result if you're not infected. In some cases, Dr. Pierre said, providers will give a rapid test first in hopes of treating the flu as soon as possible, then send a sample for RT-PCR testing to the lab to be sure of the diagnosis. Either way, your provider's goal is to help you feel better and prevent the spread in the community. "The reason flu tests are important is because there's treatment," said Dr. Murphy. Tests for COVID-19 and Flu Also important: There is a test that can check for both seasonal flu and COVID-19—these tests were sent to public health laboratories in August 2020, and the CDC continues to make and distribute the kits throughout the US. (Note: You can also have the flu and COVID-19 at the same time, making these dual tests even more important.) So What Should You Do After a Positive Flu Test? If your flu test is positive, your healthcare provider will provide treatment options and the laboratory will likely report the results to the state Department of Health because the CDC collects information on flu infections year-round in the U.S. Get Treatment Your healthcare provider will also decide whether or not you need treatment. One treatment for influenza is the antiviral drug Tamiflu—also called oseltamivir—which can reduce the duration of symptoms and prevent serious side effects, but Dr. Mahoney said it's only effective within the first 48 to 72 hours of symptoms. Other antiviral medications, such as Zanamivir, Peramivir, and Baloxavir can also be prescribed to treat the flu. The key is to talk with a healthcare provider as soon as you notice symptoms so that if you need treatment it can be provided during the time when it's most effective. While anyone can take Tamiflu or other antiviral medications, healthcare providers often prescribe it for people who: Are hospitalizedAre very sick but not hospitalizedHave a higher risk of severe illness or hospitalization from influenza (such as pregnant people and adults over age 65) "We may even treat those patients if they don't test positive for flu," explained Dr. Mahoney. In general, Dr. Pierre said, patients tolerate Tamiflu well, but some people experience nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and headaches as side effects. Prevent the Spread In addition to any antiviral drugs you're given—or if you're given the OK to treat yourself at home with rest and fluids—you should still take precautions to make sure you don't make anyone else sick. The CDC recommends: Limiting your contact with others Washing your hands frequently Keeping commonly-touched surfaces clean Covering your nose or mouth when you cough or sneeze You should also do your best to stay home (except if you need medical care)—a good rule is to wait at least 24 hours until your fever is gone to go out in public.

CNN — There’s a chill is in the air, and you all know what that means — it’s time for cold and flu season, when it seems everyone you know is suddenly sneezing, sniffling or worse. It’s almost as if those pesky cold and flu germs whirl in with the first blast of winter weather. Yet germs are present year-round — just think back to your last summer cold. So why do people get more colds, flu and now Covid-19 when it’s chilly outside? In what they called a “breakthrough,” scientists uncovered the biological reason we get more respiratory illnesses in winter — the cold air itself damages the immune response occurring in the nose. “This is the first time that we have a biologic, molecular explanation regarding one factor of our innate immune response that appears to be limited by colder temperatures,” said rhinologist Dr. Zara Patel, a professor of otolaryngology and head and neck surgery at Stanford University School of Medicine in California. She was not involved in the new study. In fact, reducing the temperature inside the nose by as little as 9 degrees Fahrenheit (5 degrees Celsius) kills nearly 50% of the billions of helpful bacteria-fighting cells and viruses in the nostrils, according to the 2022 study published in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. “Cold air is associated with increased viral infection because you’ve essentially lost half of your immunity just by that small drop in temperature,” said study author Dr. Benjamin Bleier, director of otolaryngology translational research at Massachusetts Eye and Ear and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston. “it’s important to remember that these are in vitro studies, meaning that although it is using human tissue in the lab to study this immune response, it is not a study being carried out inside someone’s actual nose,” Patel said in an email. “Often the findings of in vitro studies are confirmed in vivo, but not always.” A hornet’s nest To understand why this occurs, Bleier and his team and coauthor Mansoor Amiji, who chairs the department of pharmaceutical sciences at Northeastern University in Boston, went on a scientific detective hunt. A respiratory virus or bacteria invades the nose, the main point of entry into the body. Immediately, the front of the nose detects the germ, well before the back of the nose is aware of the intruder, the team discovered. At that point, cells lining the nose immediately begin creating billions of simple copies of themselves called extracellular vesicles, or EV’s. “EV’s can’t divide like cells can, but they are like little mini versions of cells specifically designed to go and kill these viruses,” Bleier said. “EV’s act as decoys, so now when you inhale a virus, the virus sticks to these decoys instead of sticking to the cells.” Those “Mini Me’s” are then expelled by the cells into nasal mucus (yes, snot), where they stop invading germs before they can get to their destinations and multiply. “This is one of, if not the only part of the immune system that leaves your body to go fight the bacteria and viruses before they actually get into your body,” Bleier said. Once created and dispersed out into nasal secretions, the billions of EV’s then start to swarm the marauding germs, Bleier said. “It’s like if you kick a hornet’s nest, what happens? You might see a few hornets flying around, but when you kick it, all of them all fly out of the nest to attack before that animal can get into the nest itself,” he said. “That’s the way the body mops up these inhaled viruses so they can never get into the cell in the first place.” READ MORE: Is it a cold, flu or Covid-19? A doctor helps sort it out A big increase in immune power When under attack, the nose increases production of extracellular vesicles by 160%, the study found. There were additional differences: EV’s had many more receptors on their surface than original cells, thus boosting the virus-stopping ability of the billions of extracellular vesicles in the nose. “Just imagine receptors as little arms that are sticking out, trying to grab on to the viral particles as you breathe them in,” Bleier said. “And we found each vesicle has up to 20 times more receptors on the surface, making them super sticky.” Cells in the body also contain a viral killer called micro RNA, which attack invading germs. Yet EVs in the nose contained 13 times micro RNA sequences than normal cells, the study found. So the nose comes to battle armed with some extra superpowers. But what happens to those advantages when cold weather hits? To find out, Bleier and his team exposed four study participants to 15 minutes of 40-degree-Fahrenheit (4.4-degree-Celsius) temperatures, and then measured conditions inside their nasal cavities. “What we found is that when you’re exposed to cold air, the temperature in your nose can drop by as much as 9 degrees Fahrenheit. And that’s enough to essentially knock out all three of those immune advantages that the nose has,” Bleier said. In fact, that little bit of coldness in the tip of the nose was enough to take nearly 42% of the extracellular vesicles out of the fight, Bleier said. “Similarly, you have almost half the amount of those killer micro RNA’s inside each vesicle, and you can have up to a 70% drop in the number of receptors on each vesicle, making them much less sticky,” he said. What does that do to your ability to fight off colds, flu and Covid-19? It cuts your immune system’s ability to fight off respiratory infections by half, Bleier said. READ MORE: Why people who qualify should get the RSV vaccine You don’t have to wear a nose sock As it turns out, the pandemic gave us exactly what we need to help fight off chilly air and keep our immunity high, Bleier said. Wearing a mask can protect you from cold air that can reduce your immunity, an expert says. sebra/Adobe Stock “Not only do masks protect you from the direct inhalation of viruses, but it’s also like wearing a sweater on your nose,” he said. Patel agreed: “The warmer you can keep the intranasal environment, the better this innate immune defense mechanism will be able to work. Maybe yet another reason to wear masks!” In the future, Bleier expects to see the development of topical nasal medications that build upon this scientific revelation. These new pharmaceuticals will “essentially fool the nose into thinking it has just seen a virus,” he said. “By having that exposure, you’ll have all these extra hornets flying around in your mucous protecting you,” he added.

Video Ad Feedback Seasonal flu: What you need to know 01:46 - Source: CNN Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez is a primary care pediatrician and an assistant professor of pediatrics at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. CNN — Laura Tejeda had been up watching her 7-month-old daughter Zoelis’ breathing all night this past November. She had been to a local hospital near the family’s home earlier in the day, concerned about a fever and Zoelis’ breathing being off, but had been sent home. In the middle of the night, Tejeda watched Zoelis’ chest tighten, and she knew she had to act. She got in a taxi from the Bronx to New York Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan, where a nurse took one look at Zoelis and brought her straight to the back. baby feet and oxygen saturation monitor Bibiz1/iStockphoto/Getty Images Demand for hospital-grade cribs on the rise as viral illnesses continue to surge “I wasn’t even registered,” Tejeda said. Zoelis needed BiPAP, or positive pressure ventilation, along with oxygen to help her breathe and was admitted to the intensive care unit. The culprit behind her illness: influenza A, the most common strain of the influenza virus currently circulating across the country. To Tejeda, the diagnosis came as a surprise. “I’d never seen an illness like this,” she said. “[The] flu is not just a bad cold; it can be a very serious illness in children” and adults, said Dr. Melissa Stockwell, an associate professor of pediatrics and population and family health at Columbia University Irving Medical Center and Division Chief of Child and Adolescent Health. “Young children are at higher risk of hospitalization and serious complications of flu,” she added. Young children are also at risk of developing secondary infections like pneumonia and ear infections, explains Stockwell, and older kids can develop sinusitis. Flu is not just a bad cold Pediatricians have always worried that parents think of the flu as a bad cold when that is not the case, Stockwell explains. Children have smaller airways, placing them at risk for respiratory complications from flu. The combination of high fevers and feeling unwell can also make it hard for children to drink fluids and can quickly lead to dehydration, she says. CDC/AP Children's painkillers are in high demand as respiratory illnesses continue to rise “What has been added now to that underlying misperception is that we have not seen much flu over the recent flu seasons due to all of the precautions around Covid-19,” she added. “Parents, especially of younger children, may not be thinking about flu in the way they might have a few years ago, but they should.” This year, the country experienced an early and large flu wave, Stockwell says. By the end of November, the rate of hospitalizations due to influenza was higher than that seen any year at this time since 2010, and rising, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition to its rapid spread across the country, the spread within households is swift, as Tejeda and her family recently experienced. Flu can spread quickly to family members “We all got it at home … one after the other,” said Tejeda, who developed fatigue and severe nausea herself while caring for Zoelis in the hospital. Then her two older children, as well as two cousins, came down with the virus, followed by her father, a type 2 diabetic who needed to go to the hospital and is still recovering weeks later.

The result is often missed days of school, activities and work for parents, she added. For parents, the toll of caring for everyone at home over a long period of time can be taxing. “I don’t know what it’s like to sleep anymore,” said Tejeda, whose 9-year-old son, Damian, has asthma and whose breathing she has been closely monitoring alongside Zoelis’. “I don’t wish this on anyone.” The best way to protect your family Most children with influenza will recover well at home, Lockwood explains.

Anyone can, so that’s why it is so important to protect yourself with vaccination,” Lockwood said. “Getting a flu shot is the single best way to prevent the flu,” Stockwell said. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the CDC both recommend that children be vaccinated starting at 6 months of age. Children 6 months through 8 years who are receiving the flu vaccine for the first time should receive two doses one month apart.

Zoelis continues to recover at home, Tejeda said. “Her appetite is coming back, and she’s starting to be more playful again,” she added. Although she has recovered from a bout of influenza A, Tejeda chose to complete Zoelis’ vaccination series and protect her against additional strains of the flu this season. She recently received her second dose of the flu vaccine.

Nationwide, flu hospital admissions almost doubled last week.Visits to doctors' offices, urgent care and emergency rooms are the highest they have been in the last decade.In Los Angeles County, flu rates have reached 25% -- a level not seen at this time of year in the past four years, many of them are children."We are seeing a tremendous number of children with Influenza A," Dr. Anthony Cardillo, an emergency room specialist and CEO of Mend Urgent Care, said in an interview with ABC7. "That's because they're back in school, they're in athletics, they're doing different things, a lot of transmission is happening."The only difference this year is this flu virus is very, very strong. It's had time to mutate. And that's what we're seeing now."The annual winter flu season usually doesn't get going until December or January, but this one began early and has been complicated by the simultaneous spread of other viruses.Flu, COVID and RSV are all viruses that may all seem like the common cold at first, but there are slight differences that can help parents get a sense of what is going on.The measure of traffic in doctor's offices is based on reports of symptoms like coughs and sore throats, not on lab-confirmed diagnoses. So it may include other respiratory illnesses.That makes it hard to compare to flu seasons from before the COVID-19 pandemic. Other years also didn't have this year's unusually strong wave of RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, a common cause of cold-like symptoms that can be serious for infants and the elderly.Flu shots are recommended for nearly all Americans who are at least 6 months old or older.The Associated Press contributed to this report.¿Quieres leer este artículo en español?

An Instagram post (direct link, archive link) features a picture of an at-home kit that tests for both COVID-19 and the flu."So you can buy a test kit for COVID19 and Influenza A&B," reads the Nov. 27 post's text. "Conclusion: 1. COVID19 no real difference than the flu (sic) 2. That's why there mysteriously was NO FLU last year – all misdescribed as COVID19."Similar iterations of the claim have been shared on Facebook and Twitter.But the claim is false. The kit tests for COVID-19 and influenza separately. The two illnesses differ in prevention, long-term effects and transmissibility, and they are caused by different viruses.Follow us on Facebook! Like our page to get updates throughout the day on our latest debunks When USA TODAY reached out to the user who shared the post for comment they said they had seen the claim on their local news but provided no evidence proving it.Flu and Covid are different, and antigen kit tests the viruses separatelyThough COVID-19 and the flu are both respiratory illnesses with similar symptoms, they are not the same. USA TODAY has previously debunked claims that the coronavirus does not exist and is only a flu strain. While COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a new coronavirus, the flu is caused by the influenza A and B viruses.Fact check: Omicron coronavirus variant is not the common coldThe effects of the two viruses are also not the same for many people.COVID-19 is much deadlier than the flu. While the World Health Organization estimates that about 290,000 to 650,000 deaths are caused by the flu every year, more than 6 million deaths were caused by COVID-19 in the first two years of the pandemic alone. The coronavirus also leaves many people with long-term effects, such as shortness of breath and changes in smell and taste, and it can spread more easily, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Both COVID-19 and flu vaccines must be administered to protect against the two viruses. The claim that there were no flu cases last year is also false. According to the CDC, cases during the 2020-2021 season were low, but there was still flu activity. An estimated 9 million people caught the flu during the 2021-2022 season, the center reports.The reasons for the reduction include high flu vaccination rates as well as COVID-19 mitigation measures, such as wearing face masks and hand washing.The kit that appears in the claim is manufactured by Fanttest, a China-based biotech company, and it tests for each virus separately. The kit contains a device that tests for COVID-19 on one side and influenza on the other, as the company's website shows.According to the instructions, users insert a nasal swab into both nostrils and create a solution from their nasal specimen that they add to a COVID-19 test and then an influenza test. Users have to wait 15 minutes before the results are shown. Fanttest's dual-testing kit is certified by the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia, not the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The kit is not available for purchase in the U.S.In fact, no at-home flu tests have been approved by the FDA because of concerns about a lack of accuracy and varying sensitivity, according to Stat News.USA TODAY previously debunked claims that having the flu can result in a positive COVID-19 test."No test for this virus can get approval if it gives false positives with other common respiratory viruses," Dr. Stephen Morse, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University Medical Center, previously told USA TODAY. Our rating: FalseBased on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that a COVID-19 and influenza dual-testing kit proves they are the same thing. The kit tests for COVID-19 and influenza separately.

MCDPH is encouraging everyone ages six months and older to get vaccinated against COVID and flu to prevent additional cases as people gather this holiday season.“Respiratory viruses can cause severe disease, especially in infants, young children, and older adults,” said Dr. Nick Staab, medical epidemiologist at MCDPH. “It is concerning to see so many cases before many holiday gatherings and travel have even happened. We are already seeing a strain on our healthcare systems.”Influenza cases are now “widespread” in Maricopa County, which is the highest category of flu spread. The CDC says that Maricopa County is in the high category for COVID transmission. At this level of transmission, the CDC recommends wearing a mask indoors in public, which includes during travel and in other public settings. RSV cases are more than two times higher than during the average peak.Residents are encouraged to get vaccinated and to recognize the signs of respiratory illnesses. There is no vaccine for RSV, but flu and COVID-19 vaccines are effective at preventing many infections and reducing the severity of breakthrough infections. People with symptoms should stay home and away from others unless they’re seeking healthcare. If going out is necessary, they should wear a mask around others. Getting tested by a medical provider can confirm which virus a person has and determine treatment options.Symptoms of COVID-19, flu, and RSV can include:Runny or stuffy noseCoughing/sore throatFeverMuscle or body achesFatigueHeadachesIn children under age one, symptoms of RSV can also include irritability, decreased appetite, decreased activity, and pauses while breathing (apnea).“Staying up-to-date on flu and COVID-19 vaccines is a simple way to prevent infections, reduce the spread of respiratory illness and prevent severe disease,” said Dr. Staab. “You can get them on the same day at many places, and there’s still time to get vaccinated before the holidays.” It’s best to get vaccinated at least two weeks ahead of gatherings or travel so the body has time to build up protection.Protection from vaccines is enhanced by also using other prevention tactics. These include proper and frequent hand-washing; wearing a mask in crowded indoor areas; and avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands. If you are sick with a respiratory illness, stay home and away from others, especially if you cannot wear a mask around others to decrease the spread of illness.For more information:See a listing of MCDPH’s community vaccine events and where to find other vaccine providers at Maricopa.gov/VaccineLocations.See data on local spread of COVID-19 at Maricopa.gov/COVID19dataSee data on local spread of flu and RSV at Maricopa.gov/flu.### ⇐Previous Maricopa County Department of Public Health Conducting Point of Dispensing ExerciseNext⇒ Public Health Conducting Dengue Surveillance in One Neighborhood Other News in Public HealthMaricopa County Makes Significant Investments in East Valley Community ServicesPosted on: July 24, 2024Maricopa County, Clear Channel Outdoor Launch Regional Heat Relief Billboard CampaignPosted on: June 20, 2024Public Health launches new data dashboard to help visualize effects of heat on healthPosted on: May 30, 2024Maricopa County Launches 2024 Heat Relief Efforts on May 1Posted on: April 30, 20242023 Set A New Record For Heat Deaths In A Single Year in Maricopa CountyPosted on: March 13, 2024Additional Measles Cases Identified Related to Recent ExposurePosted on: February 22, 2024Two Public Exposures Identified Through Measles InvestigationPosted on: February 12, 2024Measles Case Confirmed in Maricopa County as Cases Rise in U.S., OverseasPosted on: February 10, 20242023 Confirmed Heat Deaths Match Record High in Maricopa CountyPosted on: October 19, 2023Maricopa County Invests $2M in Opioid Settlement Funds to Support 12 Local OrganizationsPosted on: August 31, 2023Maricopa County Confirms Pediatric Flu DeathPosted on: January 24, 2023Maricopa County Department of Public Health Conducting Point of Dispensing ExercisePosted on: January 9, 2023Public Health Conducting Dengue Surveillance in One NeighborhoodPosted on: November 14, 2022Maricopa County Public Health Releases Final Annual Heat Report for 2021Posted on: October 5, 2022Three Measles Cases Confirmed in Maricopa CountyPosted on: September 1, 2022Maricopa County Prioritizes Limited Supply of Monkeypox Vaccine for High-Risk IndividualsPosted on: August 5, 2022MCDPH Launches Interactive Dashboard Highlighting COVID-19 Stories from County ResidentsPosted on: July 26, 2022Maricopa County Prioritizes Limited Supply of Monkeypox Vaccine for Exposed PersonsPosted on: July 8, 2022Maricopa County Public Health Awards Community Groups Nearly $6M to Address Health DisparitiesPosted on: July 5, 2022COVID-19 and Flu Spread Widely in Maricopa CountyPosted on: June 10, 2022Maricopa County Announces First Probable Monkeypox CasePosted on: June 7, 2022Public Health Launches Two Media Campaigns Promoting High-Impact HIV Prevention and CarePosted on: December 14, 2021Six Cases of Omicron Variant Detected in Maricopa CountyPosted on: December 13, 2021 Live Edit 301 West Jefferson StreetPhoenix, Arizona 85003Main Line: 602-506-3011ADA Compliance Using This Site Sitemap Accessibility Copyright Notices Site Terms & Privacy Policy Home /QuickLinks.aspx Residents Contact Us Board Meetings and Agendas Organizational Chart Volunteer/Intern Opportunities Required Postings /QuickLinks.aspx Visitors About Maricopa County Quick Facts Economic Development Working for Us Newsroom /QuickLinks.aspx Loading Loading Do Not Show Again Close Arrow Left Arrow Right [] Slideshow Left Arrow Slideshow Right ArrowFlu shots are a "very good match" to this season's strains, CDC says - CBS News Latest U.S. World America Decides Election 2024 Election Updates Senate Election Results House Election Results Politics Entertainment HealthWatch MoneyWatch Crime Sports Essentials Local News Baltimore Bay Area Boston Chicago Colorado Detroit Los Angeles Miami Minnesota New York Philadelphia Pittsburgh Sacramento Texas Live CBS News 24/7 Baltimore Bay Area Boston Chicago Colorado Detroit Los Angeles Miami Minnesota New York Philadelphia Pittsburgh Sacramento Texas 48 Hours 60 Minutes Shows 48 Hours 60 Minutes America Decides CBS Evening News CBS Mornings CBS News Mornings CBS Reports CBS Saturday Morning The Daily Report The Dish Eye on America Face the Nation Here Comes the Sun Person to Person Sunday Morning The Takeout The Uplift Weekender CBS News Investigates CBS Village Podcasts In Depth Newsletters Download Our App CBS News Team Executive Team Brand Studio Paramount Shop Paramount+ Join Our Talent Community RSS Feeds A Moment With...

The new data comes as officials are redoubling their calls for Americans to get vaccinated as this year's flu season gets off to an early and worrisome start."We look in real time as to how well we think the influenza match is to what's circulating. And right now, the good news is that it looks like it is a very good match," Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told reporters at a briefing on Monday. Every year, the CDC tests hundreds of samples collected from Americans with the flu, in an effort to track if the virus could be evading the current season's vaccines. The CDC reported on Friday that most of the viruses tested so far this season are similar to the strains that were picked out by officials for this year's updated vaccines. Using antibodies from ferrets, the agency said almost all samples they tested "were well recognized" by the animals' immune responses.Almost every sample tested by public health laboratories around the country so far this year have been from the Influenza A type of virus. Only 0.1% were Influenza B. All viruses tested so far this season have also been susceptible to the four antiviral treatments that are currently recommended for flu patients. However, actual estimates of how well the vaccines are fending off flu cases and severe disease will have to wait until the spring, when results begin to be released from the CDC's ongoing vaccine effectiveness studies.Last March, the CDC concluded that last season's "influenza vaccination did not significantly reduce the risk of outpatient medically attended illness" against the predominant strain of viruses. "We would expect clinical vaccine effectiveness to be quite good, but we won't know that until sometime in the early part of next year, depending upon how these vaccine effectiveness studies enroll," the CDC's Tim Uyeki told a webinar hosted by the Infectious Diseases Society of America on Saturday.While the flu season started far earlier this year compared to pre-pandemic seasons, Uyeki cautioned that it could still be far from over. Influenza B viruses tend to start increasing after Influenza A peaks, he said, and could lead to a renewed wave. "So just because we haven't seen a lot of influenza B so far, it may be coming, if this is a typical influenza season," said Uyeki.At the CDC briefing on Monday, the American Medical Association's Dr. Sandra Fryhofer urged Americans not to let down their guard even if they had recovered from a flu infection already once this season. She urged Americans to seek out a flu shot rather than risk getting infected again."We've forgotten how bad the flu can be. But this year's season is a shout out that it can get really bad and it's here, so people need to get vaccinated," Fryhofer said. Is it COVID, RSV, or the flu? How to tell the difference amid surge in cases 01:57 Weekly CDC surveys suggest that about 40% of children have gotten their flu vaccination this year, around the same rate as this time last year. However, early data from shots given in pharmacies and doctors offices suggests the rollout may be lagging in adults. More than 51.7 million shots were given through mid-November to adults there this year, compared to 54.1 million for the same point in 2021.Flu hospitalizations have also now begun to accelerate around the country this year, officials said, with the pace of new admissions having "almost doubled" around Thanksgiving compared to the week prior. The weekly rate of hospitalizations tracked in the CDC's Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network has already reached the peaks that were seen several weeks later in some pre-pandemic winters.And the pace of new COVID-19 hospitalizations has now begun to accelerate as well around the country, increasing around 17.4% compared to the week prior. "The rise in cases and hospitalizations is especially worrisome as we move into the winter months, when more people are assembling indoors, with less ventilation, and as we approach the holiday season, where many are gathering with loved ones across multiple generations," said Walensky.

Here’s what it looks likeThe good news is that you can’t catch the flu from your dogBy Noor AdatiaTrending ReporterDec. 8, 2022|Updated 2:43 p.m. CST|3 min. read(Dreamstime/TNS)Your neighbor might not be the only individual catching the flu this season in D-FW — veterinarians say it’s possible your dog could catch canine influenza, especially after boarding them during the holidays.Across North Texas, many pet shelters and clinics reported outbreaks of dog flu in their facilities last month, including Operation Kindness in Carrollton, which briefly suspended adoptions in November. AdvertisementCanine flu tends to break out in pockets, and the virus can be highly contagious on a local level, said Lori Teller, a clinical associate professor at Texas A&M’s College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences.Advertisement“It’s not super-common throughout the U.S., but when it does occur in an area, like the Dallas shelter or recently in Waco, a lot of dogs can become infected by it,” Teller said.Breaking NewsGet the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond.SIGN UPOr with: GoogleFacebookBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy PolicyTeller added that dog flu is likely on the rise due to more people getting out with their dogs. Early on in the pandemic, most pets stayed at home and were less likely to catch influenza.Here’s everything you need to know about canine flu, including what it looks like, how it spreads and what to do if your dog gets infected.AdvertisementWhat is canine influenza?Canine influenza is a disease that attacks cells in a dog’s respiratory tract, according to local no-kill animal shelter Operation Kindness.Similar to the human flu, dog flu also spreads via respiratory droplets, including by sniffing and licking other dogs and objects. Infected dogs can also transmit the virus through barking, coughing and sneezing.Advertisement“It’s easily spread among dogs because they use their nose and their mouth to do almost everything,” Teller said.AdvertisementThe infection can also stay in the environment for up to 48 hours, including on surfaces and clothing.But unlike regular influenza that spikes during the fall and winter months, dog flu is not considered a seasonal virus. Infections in dogs can occur anytime during the year, and most occur in areas where dogs congregate, such as dog parks, doggy daycare centers and boarding kennels.In addition, while all dogs are susceptible to the flu, younger and older dogs are more likely to catch the illness, Teller said. Dogs with underlying health conditions are also more prone to infection.AdvertisementThe virus isn’t deadly, but dog flu can develop into more serious health complications, Teller said. Less than 10% of dogs who get the flu develop pneumonia.Canine influenza can also occasionally infect cats — but never humans. According to the CDC, no humans have reported catching canine influenza.What does it look like?Dogs that catch the flu appear sluggish and may act uninterested in playing or interacting with people, Teller said. Other primary symptoms include coughing and sneezing.Advertisement“They may appear to ache,” she added. “Like if they’re trying to get up, they may look achy and uncomfortable.”Symptoms can last anywhere from one to three weeks, but it usually takes seven to 10 days for the illness to run its course. It takes about two days for symptoms to develop in dogs, and owners may not know their dog is contagious until it’s too late.Some signs of canine influenza overlap with another upper respiratory illness known as kennel cough, so it’s important to see your veterinarian to get your dog tested and determine the best treatment.Since there is no cure for the canine flu, veterinarians are likely to treat symptoms by recommending antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medications or increasing fluid intake, according to Operation Kindness.AdvertisementHow to protect your dogThe best way to protect your dog from the flu is by getting the canine flu vaccine, which is an initial two-shot series that requires an annual booster. Owners that regularly board their dogs should consider requesting a vaccine from their veterinarian, Teller said.Other preventative measures include cleaning shared spaces and surfaces, washing bedding and sanitizing dog toys and bowls.While humans cannot catch the flu from their dogs, people can spread the virus from dog to dog. To prevent transmission, owners should practice good hygiene and change their clothes after interacting with a potentially infected dog.By Noor AdatiaNoor Adatia is a trending news reporter on the breaking team.

HOME / Children's This is already a significant season for respiratory illness Previous pandemic isolation leads to a rise in sick kids, hospitalizations nationwide Written by Courtney Collen December 9, 2022 5 min read HOME / Children's Hospitals are seeing an influx of young patients with respiratory illness including RSV and flu. RSV is most dangerous in babies and toddlers. (Photo by Getty Images; video by Courtney Collen, Sanford Health) Medical experts are already calling this a bad year for respiratory viruses, and they anticipate more illness into the winter months. Hospitals are seeing an influx of young patients hospitalized with respiratory illnesses including RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) and influenza, according to Sanford Health Chief Physician Jeremy Cauwels, M.D. RSV is most dangerous in children under 18 months of age and can range from cold symptoms to more serious inflammation in the lungs. Stephanie Hanson, M.D., who specializes in pediatrics, is seeing more severe cases on the rise at Sanford in Fargo, North Dakota. “Anytime we see high rates of community transmission of respiratory illness, we worry about our patients,” Dr. Hanson told Sanford Health News. “This particular virus is known to cause difficulty breathing in infants and toddlers, dehydration, prolonged illness and can result in hospitalization.” More: Is it a cold or RSV? Know when to call your child’s doctor Why we’re seeing more illness this year We learned a lot about infection prevention during the pandemic. Dr. Hanson said to prevent the spread of a new virus, our social distancing measures, masking and isolation while sick, kept away other illnesses as well. “Now that many of us aren’t practicing all of those measures in our day-to-day life, it opens the door for more infection to spread,” Dr. Hanson added. “Many of us think that’s why we’re seeing an increase in cases this winter.” They advise, our best defense against respiratory illness includes the following for any age group: Vaccination for COVID-19 and influenza Good hygiene like handwashing Proper nutrition Adequate sleep Vaccines effective for kids and adults Vaccines can help prevent or lessen the severity of illnesses like flu and COVID-19. “These vaccinations are highly encouraged by pediatricians,” Dr. Hanson added. “They are safe and effective at either preventing illness or serious complications.” Dr. Cauwels said the vaccine is just as important for adults, specifically older or high-risk populations. “We recommend the flu vaccine in all of our older patients, especially if you happen to live in a place like a long-term care facility with many older people around,” he said. “We’ve seen in years past that influenza can travel around that group of people very quickly.” “Doing everything that you can to protect yourself from getting the disease and landing in the hospital is absolutely key.” Additionally, pregnant women are encouraged to get the flu and COVID-19 vaccines to pass the protection to their growing baby. “I think the flu vaccine, especially in pregnancy is one of those times where you don’t want to put your body through additional stress,” Dr. Cauwels explained. “Being pregnant is stressful enough and so making sure you’re immunized to prevent any illness while you’re pregnant is a very important tool so baby has the least eventful, healthiest pregnancy they possibly can.” When to seek care Many kids can recover at home from mild illness. But how do you know whether it’s mild or severe? Contact a health care provider if your child has any of the following: Prolonged fever Difficulty taking fluids Decreased urine output Labored or fast breathing If you have questions or concerns about the vaccines or respiratory illness, contact your primary care provider.

If we feel a little feverish, or start coughing, we reach for an at-home testing kit that tells us, with a quick nasal swab and after 15 minutes, whether we have COVID-19 or not. The tests are easy to use, and for now, paid for by insurance if you’ve got it. If you don’t have insurance, you can still get the kits for free from some community health centers.If the test shows that you’re positive, you know to stay home and mask up, and ask your doctor about taking antiviral medications that can minimize the symptoms and keep you from getting seriously ill. If you’re a parent and testing your kids, the kits can signal when to keep them at home from school.It’s a win-win, since knowing your status means you can protect not only yourself but your community by not spreading the virus when you stay home and get treated.COVID-19 has set a new standard of expectations for testing, and knowing whether you’re sick, that is starting to make the way the U.S. traditionally manages winter season diseases look archaic. Why don’t we have the same self-tests for other common illnesses that spread during the colder months—such as flu and RSV? Each year flu leads to between 300,000 and 800,000 hospitalizations in the U.S., while RSV sends up to 80,000 young children under five years old to the hospital annually.“The pandemic shifted people’s expectations,” says Dr. Michael Mina, chief science officer at eMed, a digital health company that offers at-home testing and telemedicine options to help with those tests for a range of illnesses. “It’s driving people to ask, ‘why do I need to go to the doctor when COVID-19 testing has shown me that it’s totally safe and okay for me to [use self-tests to determine] if I’m positive for a respiratory illness?’”Until the pandemic hit, at-home testing was a health trend struggling for respect. While convenient, the medical community and health regulators at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) weren’t convinced that people could reliably test themselves at home for things like flu, and interpret the results accurately. Decades earlier, home pregnancy test kits battled through similar validation issues, as health care experts raised concerns about releasing a test that wasn’t always completely accurate and about the need to educate women about interpreting the results. Ultimately, regulators decided that the level of uncertainty was an acceptable tradeoff for arming women with knowledge about their pregnancy status and the tests became available in 1978 over the counter.With similar reasoning, and this time driven by the urgent need during the pandemic to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the FDA authorized the first at-home rapid tests for COVID-19 in spring 2020. Millions of people have since tested themselves or their children, without a medical professional, effectively and responsibly. “The COVID-19 pandemic led to a shift in empowering citizens with the ability to test themselves for respiratory infections,” says Dr. Chaz Langelier, associate professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at University of California San Francisco. “The average person in the U.S. now has a working knowledge of the public health implications of respiratory infections on a level that wasn’t there pre-pandemic.”Read more: Flu Season Is Coming. mRNA Flu Shots Aren’t Far Behind The barriers to self-testingStudies conducted on at-home COVID-19 tests showed that people don’t need a medical degree to insert a swab up their nose, swirl it around, and then insert the swab in a pre-made solution and read the resulting lines. In fact, that technology is essentially the same one that doctors and nurses use in doctors’ offices, emergency rooms and health centers to test for influenza, RSV, and strep. “The average person thinks that when they go to the doctor and he or she uses a rapid strep or flu test, that the doctor is doing something complicated behind the scenes,” says Mina. “But no, it’s just the same swabbing of the nose or throat and the same lateral flow antigen test [as in the home kits]. The COVID-19 self tests have demystified how some of these medical tests are performed. And opened to door to people asking, ‘why don’t I have access to that?’”The reason they don’t yet has to do with a number of factors, from cultural bias to the economics of the flu-testing market. The medical community has historically been reluctant to entrust self-tests in the hands of the public because of concerns about how well the people without medical expertise can collect the samples and perform the chemical reaction required to detect the presence of a virus or bacteria. But streamlined ways to contain reagents and present them in a straightforward way, such as the easy-to-use COVID-19 test kits, have made the process nearly mistake-proof, Mina says.While that may be true of the COVID-19 self tests, the self-tests for flu that are still being developed aren’t quite there yet. Doctors have relied for years on so-called point-of-care testing that provides results within minutes about whether their patients have flu, but they have also known that the false negative rate of these tests can range up to 40%. “You trade accuracy for speed,” says Dr. Lisa Maragakis, professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Such rapid antigen tests, which pick up proteins made by viruses like SARS-CoV-2 or influenza, are relatively good at detecting people who are positive, leading to low false positive rates, but a negative result doesn’t always mean the person is free and clear. Doctors take other factors into consideration, such as the patient’s symptoms and exposures, when interpreting negative results. And if needed, they repeat the test to confirm the result.Read more: The Enthusiast’s Guide To At-Home COVID-19 TestsTo date, another reason at-home tests for viruses like influenza haven’t filled pharmacy shelves has been the relatively low demand for them. Most doctors don’t order flu tests for every patient who complains of fever and fatigue during flu season. They make an educated guess based on their patients’ symptoms that with influenza viruses circulating widely during the winter months, those people most likely have the flu—and most treatments, such as Tamiflu, are relatively safe but need to be started as soon as possible after symptoms appear in order to be effective. And manufacturers decided that if there wasn’t great uptake of flu tests in the medical community, then for the same reasons, there likely wouldn’t be demand for at-home versions either. Most people with flu-like symptoms would assume they have the flu and wouldn’t feel the need to test themselves to confirm that.But COVID-19 changed that. Since COVID-19 causes similar symptoms to flu of fever, muscle aches and fatigue, doctors can no longer safely assume their patients are infected with influenza. Now, it’s important to distinguish the two infections because they have different antiviral treatments. Having self-tests for influenza as well as SARS-CoV-2 would help to differentiate them and get people started on the right medications for their respective infections more quickly. “Clinicians are inclined to trust a positive test in the scenario of a patient who also has symptoms consistent with disease,” says Maragakis. “We see that with COVID-19 that doctors are incorporating results of home tests more and more into their clinical decision-making.”The promise of self-testingAt-home self testing could streamline the entire journey from sick patients to testing to treatments, says Mina. Especially if the convenience of DIY testing is combined with an easy way to access medical advice and treatments via telemedicine. For example, looping in a doctor, nurse, or qualified health care expert using telemedicine after people test themselves can help them interpret their results and provide them with prescription treatments, all from their own home. Some COVID-19 self-test kits already provide this connection, with a link or number that helps the test-taker connect to a telemedicine professional to validate results to document their COVID-19 status for travel or other purposes. It gives people the privacy and convenience of testing themselves, while also supporting that testing with any medical service they might need. “Tying these tests to care is a really smart thing,” says Mina. “We need to give patients the tools to test themselves, but also give them the entire package of health care just like they would receive if they went to the doctor for a test.”Read more: The Troubling Trends Pointing to a Severe Flu and RSV SeasonHow close are we to having at-home flu tests?The FDA has set strict criteria for at-home tests, and the false negative rate for rapid antigen tests for influenza has been a stumbling block. Manufacturers are trying to address that concern by offering molecular tests that pick up viral genes rather than rapid-antigen tests, which identify the proteins that viruses make—these molecular tests are generally more accurate.There are, so far, no FDA-approved at-home tests for influenza. And the FDA has approved two molecular at-home tests for COVID-19, made by Lucira and Cue Health. They are more expensive (Lucira’s test is $29, and Cue offers three tests for $195) than the rapid antigen tests (which retail for around $24 for two tests) because they require more sophisticated reactions—although all of them are reimbursed by insurance. Both Lucira and Cue have developed a version of their COVID-19 self tests that also pick up influenza infection, and have requested authorization from the FDA to make these combination tests available without a prescription. The agency has not made a decision yet.Even if these molecular tests are authorized by the FDA, their high cost mean that it’s likely that rapid antigen tests for flu would still have a place, despite being less accurate. That’s because antigen tests are still relatively reliable in picking up viral proteins, which are typically at high levels in people when they first get sick—the point in time at which they are most likely to test themselves. “Especially at the beginning stages of infection, you don’t need super-duper sensitivity,” says Mina. “You just need to know if you are positive so you know that treatment is right for you and that you’re infectious and should probably stay home.Why expanding self-testing is importantIncreased access to self testing would likely give experts a better window into exactly how much disease was circulating in a given region. “[Health care professionals] are doing so little testing for flu and RSV at baseline now, it’s not like we would be facing a loss of pre-existing surveillance if more people test at home,” says Langelier.“I almost guarantee that five years from now, everyone will have access to these,” says Mina of self-tests for common infectious illnesses. “We are in the ugly duckling phase where the antigen self-tests are not perfect, but we can combine them with telehealth technology to better enhance people’s ability to care for themselves. We have to start somewhere, and it’s going to get better.”More Must-Reads from TIMEHow Donald Trump WonThe Best Inventions of 2024Why Sleep Is the Key to Living LongerHow to Break 8 Toxic Communication HabitsNicola Coughlan Bet on Herself—And WonWhat It’s Like to Have Long COVID As a Kid22 Essential Works of Indigenous CinemaMeet TIME's Newest Class of Next Generation LeadersContact us at letters@time.comEdit PostHomeU.S.PoliticsWorldHealthBusinessTechPersonal Finance by TIME StampedShopping by TIME StampedFuture of Work by CharterEntertainmentIdeasScienceHistorySportsMagazineThe TIME VaultTIME For KidsTIMECO2CouponsTIME EdgeVideoMastheadNewslettersSubscribeDigital MagazineGive a GiftShop the TIME StoreCareersModern Slavery StatementPress RoomTIME StudiosU.S. & Canada Customer CareGlobal Help CenterContact the EditorsReprints and PermissionsSite MapMedia KitSupplied Partner ContentAbout Us© 2024 TIME USA, LLC.

Mom Shelle Allen thought Madi was worn down from a busy winter and had a bad cold. Madi progressively became sicker and needed help showering and that’s Allen noticed Madi’s lips were blue as she struggled to breathe. “I knew something serious was going on,” Allen, 47, of Jacksonville, Illinois, tells TODAY.com. “Her face was all sunken in — it was almost grayish looking.” They rushed to the hospital where the Allens learned what was wrong with Madi: She had the flu and double pneumonia. “I never imagined that we would finally get the diagnosis of influenza,” Allen says. “It’s just the flu. We get over it. And I’ve said that numerous times myself. The sad part is, I didn’t know that the flu doesn’t discriminate. It doesn’t care if you are a healthy person or an older person.” Lingering cold that won’t go awayIn February 2011, Madi fell ill with what seemed like a cold at the time. She experienced a fever and a cough. The family gave her over-the-counter medications, but her cough wouldn't go away. At first, it seemed like Madi was exhausted from a busy winter schedule and had a bad cold. Her family never suspected flu could be making her so ill.Courtesy Shelle Allen“Her symptoms got worse. But still every time I gave her over-the counter-medications, like Tylenol or cold medicine, her symptoms seemed to improve a little,” Allen explains. “I wouldn’t say she was her normal self. But I felt like there was enough improvement that it wasn’t an emergency.” Over the weekend, Madi’s cold seemed stable. On Monday when she tried to shower, she needed her mom to help her. That’s when Allen knew something was seriously wrong with her daughter’s health. “I did think that there was something more going on,” Allen says. “The cough started to get worse and worse.” When they arrived in the emergency room, the family learned what was making Madi so sick. Madi had double pneumonia and flu. Allen felt stunned. “I was in complete shock that the flu could cause this much of an issue for her,” she says. Madi normally received a flu vaccine, but that year it “fell off of my radar,” and she didn’t get one. “She has always been vaccinated,” Allen says. “ That year (she didn’t get one). Again, I go back to (the fact that) I didn’t know the importance of it.”At their local hospital, doctors gave her the maximum amount of oxygen before transferring her to another hospital. “Her body was just failing. Her organs were failing. At this time, they had already intubated her,” Allen recalls. “They came and told my husband and I that there was nothing more that they could do for her in that hospital … she needed to be on life support because her lungs were shutting down.” Her kidneys were also failing, and her heart had signs that indicated it was in early failure. At the larger hospital, she was placed on ECMO, a heart lung bypass machine, and dialysis. “At first, I was in complete denial. Again, I go back to, ‘it’s just the flu. We get over the flu.' That was my thought process,” Allen says. “We were just fortunate that each hospital got her to the next hospital to get the best care she could get.” Who is at the most risk for the flu? Flu hospitalizations are at a decade year high, according to NBC News. About 78,000 people have been hospitalized with flu and 4,500 have died since October. Younger children are at a particular high risk for sever flu, Dr. Lisa Doggett, a family physician in Texas, tells TODAY.com. “For a lot of people, influenza doesn’t usually have the level of mortality risk than something like COVID does. So, by comparison, you’re less likely to die if you get flu than if you get COVID,” she says. “That doesn’t mean that everybody is safe from flu.” Flu can have the greatest impact on young children and the elderly. “Kids as a rule are at a much higher risk from influenza than middle aged adults or older kids,” Doggett says. “Younger kids are one of the high-risk groups of influenza.” That’s because younger children’s immune systems aren’t as robust as older children and middle-aged people. “Those of us who are older and have been around a while have been exposed to (many viruses) and our immune systems adapt,” she says. “When we’ve been exposed to lots of different things … we get some level of immunity and we’re able to fight it off better.” Since their experience with flu, Shelle Allen has become an advocate for flu vaccines.Courtesy Shelle AllenEven still, having once had flu or once had a flu vaccine doesn’t offer people durable protection against flu, which mutates every year. That’s why getting an annual flu shot remains essential.“That immunity from the vaccine wanes over time, just as it does with the COVID vaccine,” Doggett says. “The flu virus itself is different every year and so it’s important to get an updated flu vaccine very year.” This year, it feels even more important as children with flu, RSV and COVID are overwhelming children’s hospitals. “My husband is a hospital-based pediatrician,” Doggett says. “He’s been in practice for 20 years and he’s had some of the worst shifts in his life in the last couple of weeks because they are experiencing huge volumes of cases.” Symptoms of flu include: Fever.Headache.Sore throat.CongestionBody aches.Exhaustion.These symptoms are similar to other respiratory illnesses so it can be hard to tell what a child has. Doggett urges parents of children 5 and younger to check with the pediatrician because they are at higher risk of severe illness. Parents should seek emergency care if they notice: Blue tinge around the mouth.Quick breathing.Not being able to complete a sentence because of trouble breathing.The skin around the ribs sucks in when they breathe.Madi is now 24 and works at the local visitors group in her town. Two years ago, doctors removed the lower lobe of her left lung, which was damaged from lung disease that she developed after having flu.Courtesy Shelle AllenRecovery and lifelong complicationsMadi spent 93 days in the hospital recovering. She had “to learn how to do everything all over,” including walking, eating, brushing her teeth and completing other daily tasks. “Being an athlete, she had been able to bounce a ball or kick a soccer ball for most of her life and she had to learn how to do all that over again,” Allen says. “She has to have therapy five days a week (after leaving the hospital).” Madi slowly improved and even received a scholarship to play soccer in college. Though, she still has a “chronic cough” and lung disease. “About two years ago, her lung disease started getting progressively worse,” Allen says. “Doctors actually removed the lower lobe of her left lung.” That helped Madi tremendously. “I remember after her healing, she said to me, ‘Mom, I have not felt this good in 10 years,’” Allen says. “We just didn’t realize how much damage (there was).” Allen sometimes blames herself for not getting Madi vaccinated that year. Since their experience, she started working with Families Fighting Flu to raise awareness of the importance of receiving a flu vaccine annually. “I tell our story so that no other family hopefully will have a story like ours,” Allen says.

The National Institutes of Health reports that it results in 31.4 million outpatient visits and more than 200,000 hospitalizations each year. The best weapon we have against the flu is to get a flu vaccine each year before flu season begins. The CDC recommends everyone older than 6 months get vaccinated every year. Research into the first flu vaccines began during the 1918 flu pandemic, but it wasn’t until 1945 that the first flu vaccine was licensed for wide use in the U.S. Path to improved health Flu vaccines, or flu shots, protect against the top viruses that researchers think will be the most common during that year’s flu season. While most are given in the arm using a needle, there are also nasal spray flu vaccines available for people who qualify. Most flu vaccines contain a form of the flu virus that can be either dead or alive (but weakened). They also may contain egg or animal protein, preservatives (to prevent them from spoiling), stabilizers (to keep them from losing strength over time) and sometimes very low amounts of antibiotics (to prevent contamination during production). Some different types of influenza vaccines available include: Standard-dose flu shots. These are made by growing the flu virus in an egg. They are available in different brands and are most often given with a needle. Cell-based flu shots. These are made by growing the virus in a cell culture. This means the cells are grown in a laboratory environment. This vaccine is completely egg-free. Recombinant flu shots. This means the vaccine is made without using a virus or eggs. It has three times the antigen (the part that helps your body build protection against the virus) and can help create a stronger immune response in your body. Egg-based high dose flu shots. These are for use in people 65 and older. They have four times the antigen as a regular flu shot. Egg-based adjuvanted flu shot. An adjuvant is an ingredient that helps create a stronger immune response in your body. These are also for people 65 and older. You should ask your doctor which type of flu vaccine is best for you. Download the Guide Things to consider Everyone who is 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine every flu season. Getting a flu vaccine along with another vaccine at the same visit is recommended if you are eligible and if the timing for each vaccine is right. Vaccines can prevent you from getting sick and lower the chance of serious illness if you do get sick. It can also lower the risk of having to be hospitalized from the flu. The flu shot cannot give you the flu. However, sometimes there are some side effects to the flu shot. They are usually very mild. The most common side effects are: Soreness, redness and/or swelling where the shot was given Headache Fever Nausea Muscle aches and fatigue These side effects will usually go away on their own after a few days. If they do not, talk to your doctor. People who have severe, life-threatening allergies to ingredients in flu shots should not get one. This might include gelatin or antibiotics. If you have had a strong allergic reaction to a flu shot in the past, talk with your doctor before getting another shot. For pregnant women, the flu vaccine can help protect both you and your baby and can keep them from getting sick in the first few months after they are born. Flu shots can also lower the risk of severe, life-threatening flu in children by 75%. Getting a flu vaccine can also protect people around you who are more likely to get sick, like babies, young children, and older people with existing medical conditions. If you do have an existing health condition, please talk to your doctor before getting a flu shot. Questions to ask your doctor Do I need to get a flu vaccine? Which flu vaccine is right for me? How old do my children have to be before they can get a flu vaccine? Are there any risks involved with a flu vaccine? What are the side effects of getting a flu vaccine? Why do I need a flu vaccine every year? When should I get my flu vaccine?

The department has 53 patient rooms but has made space for 100 by adding hallbeds to handle the influx of people seeking treatment.Kristyna Wentz-Graff / OPBTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a SponsorAt a media briefing Thursday, health officials said the weeks-long surge of pediatric RSV cases is starting to taper off, but influenza and COVID-19 cases among both children and adults are starting to rise.“This really is a first for Oregon, that we have seen this,” said Dr. Wendy Hasson, the medical director of pediatric intensive care at Legacy Emanuel’s Randall’s Children Hospital. “We have dealt with respiratory surges every single season every single year, but this operating above capacity really is historic and new.”State epidemiologist Dr. Dean Sidelinger said the combination of RSV, influenza and COVID is pushing hospital intensive care units beyond capacity, “which never happened during the darkest days of our COVID-19 pandemic in Oregon.”“The situation facing our hospital is extremely serious,” Sidelinger said. “Today, more hospitals are reaching a point of crisis in their adult bed capacity just as our pediatric hospitals moved to crisis care standards in the past two weeks.”Health officials at the meeting relayed stories of hours-long emergency room waits, and of treating patients in hallways or in surge rooms.The good news: the worst of RSV cases among children is now behind us, Sidelinger said. Cases are starting to stabilize since the Nov. 19 peak. Pediatric ICU bed availability has also increased, thanks in part to diminishing cases and an executive order issued by Gov. Kate Brown in late November, which was extended Wednesday. Those orders allowed hospitals to stretch resources — for instance, by assigning more patients to each nurse — thereby creating more bed space for children.THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a SponsorMeanwhile, influenza rates among people age 65 and older are rising. Sidelinger said since late October, those rates have increased tenfold. He expects rates to continue rising through the winter, as people gather indoors over the holidays.COVID infections are also rising quickly, which health officials are measuring through wastewater monitoring. COVID-related hospitalizations have also risen, Sidelinger said, moving from 235 to 347 this past month.“COVID-19 deaths remained flat over the last few months, but deaths are a lagging indicator,” he said. “We may unfortunately see that trend change.”Reporters asked why the Oregon Health Authority wasn’t calling on National Guard members to assist nurses during the crises. Sidelinger said workforces in other industries are thin, so pulling Guard volunteers from their full-time jobs is difficult. He and Hasson added that pediatric cases need careful and specialized care that most Guard members can’t provide.The health officials called on people to wear a face mask when in indoor crowded spaces, and if possible, avoid going to them altogether.“I want to encourage parents, particularly of very young babies, to feel empowered to say ‘no’ to visitors,” Hasson said. “That can be really hard, but now is the time to say, ‘No, thank you. I do not want visitors seeing my young baby.’”Hassan said of all the pediatric influenza patients she’s seen, none had been vaccinated for influenza.“Flu vaccines work,” She said. “They keep kids out of the hospital. And I cannot stress this enough: If you have been on the fence about getting your flu vaccine, now is the time to get one immediately to keep your child out of the hospital.”Despite the emergency, Sidelinger said OHA isn’t considering requesting a mask mandate.“The mask mandate in and of itself doesn’t help,” Sidelinger said. “It’s individuals choosing to wear that mask.”THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a SponsorTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR:Become a Sponsor📨 Stay informed after Election DayLearn what the election results will mean for the Pacific Northwest.

Doctor explainsByPamela Parker Tuesday, December 12, 2023How to tell the difference between RSV, flu and COVID-19Health workers are preparing for a possible "tripledemic" of flu, COVID-19, and RSV this winter. Here's how to tell the difference.SAN FRANCISCO -- Health workers are preparing for a possible "tripledemic" this holiday season of influenza (flu), COVID-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). These have many of the same symptoms in common, and it is hard to tell which one you've caught.We talked to Dr. David Hoffman, pediatric hospitalist at MarinHealth Medical Center, to share his insights on how to tell them apart and when you should and shouldn't worry."While it's impossible to know for sure which one of these viruses you have without testing, there are some distinctive symptoms for each virus," Dr. Hoffman said.Here are some symptoms of each and a guide on what to do if you or a family member is falling sick.InfluenzaOverviewThe flu typically comes on very suddenly with an incubation period of one to four days, unlike COVID-19, which tends to have a gradual onset of symptoms. Typically, people feel more miserable with the flu than with other types of viruses, and it often comes with a sore throat, nausea, body aches, vomiting, or even diarrhea. A distinctive sign of the flu can be a very high fever -- as high as 103 or 104 Fahrenheit. Fever is just the body's way of fighting the infection and is not dangerous in and of itself.Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the CDC director, said, "Hospitalizations for flu continue to be the highest we've seen for this time of year in a decade. If you do get sick, present yourself to your provider for early care. There are good antivirals to treat both flu and COVID-19."The CDC is again suggesting people voluntarily wear masks indoors to reduce their chances of getting sick in the next few weeks.It's not too late to get both vaccines - experts say you start getting protection within a week with a booster.Distinctive characteristicThe most distinctive sign of the flu can be a very high fever in the 103 to 104 range.Flu symptoms include:FeverChillsHeadacheRunny noseNauseaFatigueLoss of appetiteSore throatCOVID-19Overview"The coronavirus has become familiar to most of us, and the signs are similar to flu and RSV. To complicate it further, some people become very ill, while others have very mild symptoms, and others show no symptoms at all. While most people develop symptoms within the first week after exposure, symptoms can occur from two up to 14 days after exposure to the virus."Distinctive characteristic"Unlike other viruses, COVID-19 can affect other areas of the body outside of the lungs and, in some instances, cause long-term effects," Dr Hoffman says.COVID-19 symptoms include:CoughBrief feverShortness of breathAbdominal painLoss of taste or smellCongestionFatigueSore ThroatNausea or vomitingDiarrheaMuscle or body achesHeadacheRSVOverviewRSV is a virus that many adults would have already caught and it generally just causes cold symptoms for adults. "If you think back to that cold that you got that just wouldn't go away, you kept having congestion and perhaps a cough that lasted longer than usual, there's a decent chance that that was RSV. And again, symptoms of flu can include fever, chills, headache, runny nose, or congestion, nausea, fatigue, loss of appetite and sore throat," Dr. Hoffman said.RSV causes a runny nose, congestion, and cough for most people. According to Dr. Hoffman, RSV has a greater likelihood of causing severe illness in very young children, especially those born premature or who have lung disease or heart disease. The most distinctive symptom that some children infected with RSV will exhibit is wheezing. Wheezing is a high-pitched sound with each exhalation."For most people, and even most kids, RSV doesn't cause a dangerous illness. But it does in a subset of kids. Even kids with significant illness that require hospitalization are usually going to do just fine. Maybe they'll need a little bit of oxygen, maybe they just need to be watched closely. RSV is most likely to cause significant or, you know, more concerning illness in very young children and very old adults," Dr. Hoffman said.MORE: Everything you need to know about RSV symptoms, treatments, shotsFor the first time this year, RSV vaccines are available.For adults over age 60, there are two vaccines. For babies under 8 months old, there are two monoclonal antibody shots available, which are a bit different than a vaccine but still provide protection.Certain babies and toddlers between 8 months and 19 months entering their second RSV season are recommended to receive an antibody shot.There is also a maternal RSV vaccine, which is given to pregnant mothers in the third trimester between 32 weeks' and 36 week's gestation.Distinctive symptom The most distinctive symptom that some children infected with RSV will exhibit is wheezing, a high-pitched sound, with each exhalation.RSV symptoms include:Runny noseDecreased appetiteCoughingSneezingFeverWheezingWhen to see a doctorDr Hoffman says to seek medical care right away if these symptoms appear:Trouble breathing Pain or pressure in the chestNew confusionInability to wake up or stay awakeBluish lips or faceSevere abdominal painRefusing to eat and drinkWhen should I keep my child home?If your child is exhibiting any symptoms of RSV, flu, or COVID-19, health experts advise you to keep your child home from school to avoid spreading the virus to other people. It doesn't matter which of the viruses is the culprit. Caution should be taken to prevent the spread.Prevention: How to keep your child from getting sickPrevention is the best medicine, particularly with these viruses. These suggestions are good ideas to avoid seasonal viruses:Get your child vaccinated for flu, COVID-19, RSV, pneumococcus, and pertussis.Wash your hands regularly or use hand sanitizer.Sanitize high-contact surfaces, such as desks, tables, and doorknobs, if someone in your household is sick.If your child is sick, have them stay home to avoid spreading the illness."Everyone's talking about RSV but we do see other viruses in the community as well, like metapneumovirus, which can cause bronchitis or significant respiratory infection, or viral pneumonia. There are thousands of viruses that we don't have tests for so we don't know exactly which virus it is, but we're definitely seeing more of many different respiratory infections," Dr Hoffman said.He says the most important message he wants to impart to parents is you can do a lot more harm to yourself by being overly concerned."By being anxious and increasing stress, you therefore are making yourself more susceptible to all types of illness, chronic disease, and infection,' Dr. Hoffman says."That said, I do think that everyone should do whatever they can do to protect themselves from all of the respiratory illnesses and other vaccine preventable illnesses out there. He encouraged all pregnant mothers to get their pertussis vaccines during their pregnancy to 'cocoon' their unborn child, and preventing by preventing themselves from getting pertussis," he says.Similarly, he urged kids to get the pneumococcal vaccine (whooping cough)."Get the COVID-19 and flu vaccine for kids and adults. The flu vaccine will make you perhaps feel like you have a very mild cold but that's a lot better than getting seriously ill, or even dying from influenza. So a lot of people choose not to get the flu vaccine because they don't like that. But really the benefits are much greater than the very small risks of getting the flu vaccine or the inconvenience of getting the flu vaccine," Dr. Hoffman said."I don't think that it's a great idea to rush to your pediatrician's office or your primary care provider's office just to get tested, to try and figure out which one of these you have, aside from perhaps doing COVID-19 testing because most people who get RSV and flu and COVID-19 are going to do just fine. And so it's really only about dictating whether or not you need to isolate strictly and for how long," he said.The fact is that these respiratory viruses tend to crop up with similar symptoms, such as cough, runny nose, and fever. Fortunately for most children, it doesn't matter which of these, or the thousands of other viruses causing respiratory illnesses or colds, your child has. Most children will recover from all of these viruses on their own, without receiving medical treatment and without serious complications. If your child is sick, consider testing for COVID-19 first to inform if and how long you need to isolate your child at home.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the 2022-2023 flu season may be the worst the country has seen in more than ten years. Additionally, the number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are up more than 25% in the last two weeks. And while RSV cases are slowing down, the virus is still circulating around the country. The so-called “tripledemic” is overwhelming hospitals across the country and experts report the problem could get worse as the number of coronavirus and influenza cases have risen since Thanksgiving. With the steady growth predicted to continue, this holiday season could see the number of sick people climb as people gather with friends and family. The CDC estimates that so far this year there have been as many as 8.7 million cases of influenza including 78,000 hospitalizations and 4,500 deaths. More than 99 million cases of COVID-19 have occurred in the U.S. and more than a million people have died since the pandemic began. Currently, the number of coronavirus cases is averaging almost 60,000 a day, with some 37,000 hospitalizations and nearly 350 deaths every day. Influenza has not been a serious problem the last two years because of the masking, social distancing and other measures people took to protect themselves against COVID-19. The CDC is not a regulatory agency and does not impose mask mandates. However, its director, Rochelle Walensky, is encouraging everyone to wear masks again, especially on public transportation, in airports and on planes, while shopping and in other crowded public spaces to help prevent the spread of these respiratory illnesses. GET YOUR VACCINE It’s not too late to get your flu vaccine. The CDC is encouraging those who haven’t been vaccinated to get their shot now. It takes about two weeks for vaccines to protect against disease, so getting vaccinated now could protect people over the holidays. Everyone 6 months and older should get a flu vaccine with rare exceptions. Vaccination is particularly important for people who are at higher risk of serious complications. Information on who is at risk is available here. The CDC also recommends everyone 6 months and older should stay up to date with their COVID-19 vaccines, including boosters if eligible. Find out how to stay up to date here. Find a vaccine or booster here. You can also text your ZIP code to 438829 or call 1-800-232-0233 to find COVID-19 vaccines near you. With respiratory illnesses spreading, the American Red Cross is sharing this important reminder — it’s okay to give blood after getting a flu shot or a COVID-19 vaccine or booster. Learn more here. FLU OR COVID? If you get sick, how do you know whether you have the flu or COVID-19? There are more similarities between the two illnesses than differences, including their symptoms, making it difficult to know which virus you have. If you become sick, experts recommend that you call the doctor with your symptoms and begin to quarantine. A test may be necessary to determine which virus is making you ill. Some of the differences are that COVID-19 spreads more easily and causes more serious illness in some people. If exposed to the coronavirus, it may take longer for you to show any symptoms and you can be contagious for a longer period of time. The common signs of influenza are high fever, severe body aches, headache, being extremely tired, sore throat, cough, runny or stuffy nose, and vomiting and/or diarrhea (which is more common in children). If you think you have the flu, call your health care provider. Seek immediate care if you have any of these symptoms: Fast breathing, trouble breathing or bluish skin color Pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen (adults) Confusion or sudden dizziness Not drinking enough fluids, not being able to eat, or severe or persistent vomiting Flu-like symptoms that improve but then return with fever and worse cough Not waking up, being so irritable that the child does not want to be held or not interacting (children) Fever with a rash (children) No tears when crying or significantly fewer wet diapers than normal (children) YOU CAN HELP STOP THE FLU FROM SPREADING Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue or sleeve when coughing or sneezing and throw the tissue away after use. If a tissue isn’t available, cough or sneeze into your elbow, not your hands. Wash hands often, especially after coughing or sneezing. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand-sanitizer. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Stay home if you’re sick. More information about how to help keep you and your loved ones protected from the flu is available on this website and in the free Red Cross First Aid app. See all the Red Cross apps at redcross.org/mobileapps.

Now we know. Skip to contentNewslettersSubscribeMenuPremiumSCIENCEWhat happens if the flu and RSV fuse into a single virus? Now we know.For the first time, scientists have created a hybrid of the two seasonal viruses. Their discovery yielded a few surprises.An image from a scanning electron microscopy shows human lung cells coinfected with Flu-A and RSV producing hybrid viral particles. Flu particles (pink) and RSV filaments (green) bud from the cell surface (yellow) and hybrid viral particles contain regions corresponding to both Flu and RSV.Photograph by Joanne Haney and Margaret Mullin, University of Glasgow Centre for Virus ResearchBySanjay MishraDecember 9, 2022•6 min readFor the first time, scientists have shown that two seasonal respiratory viruses currently circulating in the United States—and overwhelming hospitals with sick kids—can form a hybrid virus under the right conditions. The finding, they say, is not a cause for worry—but it does provide some intriguing insights into how viruses learn new tricks.The influenza A virus, which causes the most common flu, and the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are the leading causes of childhood infections. Both RSV and flu viruses circulate together every year in fall and winter and people frequently get infected with both viruses. Scientists had known that during co-infections, a hybrid combining genetic material from two virus types could form, but none has ever been detected.A hybrid virus can be more infectious or can infect new parts of body; it can also be weaker than its parental viruses because of their evolutionary incompatibility. But the characteristics of potential influenza-RSV hybrid were unknown until scientists were able to create one in an experiment.“This is an interesting demonstration of how viruses can socialize and interact together,” says Olivier Schwartz, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute, in Paris, France.Sharing genesMany viruses target the respiratory system of the body, and more than one kind of virus can be present in the body at the same time. One in five infants hospitalized for a respiratory tract infection, for example, is infected with two different viruses, providing an opportunity for viruses to share genes.Hybrid viruses possessing combinations of different bits of viral genes, resulting from coinfections with two or more related viruses, have long been thought as an important step for virus evolution. For example, parts of the bovine coronaviruses may have originated from an influenza C type ancestor through such a mash-up.“Viruses pick up genes from host cells and from each other,” says Jeremy Kamil, a virologist at Louisiana State University Health at Shreveport. “We also get genes from viruses.” For example, a gene encoding a protein called syncytin, which is produced in the placenta, is thought to be a leftover from a virus that infected our mammalian ancestors, millions of years ago. But such exchanges of genes are rare and happen slowly in the evolutionary time scale.It is difficult to observe the formation of a hybrid virus, such as the one between flu and RSV, because both viruses must be present in the same cell to form a hybrid. While more than one respiratory virus can infect the body, viruses compete for dominance at the individual cell level through a phenomenon called viral interference. This means that usually only one type of virus can infect a cell; and studies in mice have confirmed that RSV and influenza compete against each other to infect a cell and multiply. This competition makes the chance of a hybrid forming in nature even more unlikely. But not impossible.Matchmaking to form a hybrid virusTo create the right conditions for two unrelated viruses to meet, scientists in the U.K. infected human lung cells in a dish in the laboratory with both influenza A and RSV viruses. “We observed quite a few cells that were coinfected with both viruses in them,” says Pablo Murcia, a virologist at University of Glasgow, UK, who led the study.In these co-infected cells, flu and RSV viruses fused together to form a new bottle-shaped hybrid virus in which the RSV bit formed the base, and the flu virus bit formed the narrow neck.You May Also LikeSCIENCEWhat triggers morning migraines? Scientists might now know.SCIENCELice don't spread the way you probably think they do. Here's what to know.SCIENCEAs food allergies rise, new treatments are on the horizon“How lovely the evidence is, that you can put these two viruses in the same cell at the same time, and produce chimeric particles,” says Kamil.The hybrid viruses were capable of infecting lower respiratory tract cells, not typically targeted by the flu virus. The hybrid virus was able to dodge flu antibodies, but antibodies against RSV effectively stopped the hybrid’s spread.“Flu uses these hybrid particles as a sort of Trojan horse,” says Murcia, which allows them to infect cells in conditions that wouldn't be normal for the virus.Is this hybrid a threat?Murcia and Kamil are emphatic that generating the RSV-flu hybrid does not yield a new, more dangerous virus. “It's not scary, it's interesting and it's not necessarily surprising,” Kamil says.Most people already have antibodies against RSV and flu after infections during their toddler years. So a hybrid virus between RSV and flu is unlikely to pose a threat by generating an immune escaping virus. Rather it is just like two viruses packaged in a single envelope, says Murcia.Moreover, the hybrid virus has still only been shown to occur in a test tube in an artificial situation. “It shows an important virologic proof-of-concept that respiratory viruses can recombine,” says Dan Barouch, a virologist at the Harvard Medical School. But it is not known how often it can happen.“Just because we're finding out about this now doesn't mean that it hasn't been happening already,” says Sarah Meskill, a pediatrician at Texas Children's Hospital, who specializes in treating viral respiratory illnesses. Meskill’s work has shown that co-infection of RSV and influenza does not warrant extra clinical attention. “It is definitely possible that RSV and flu have been making hybrids, but clinically, it doesn't seem to be relevant to the point where we need to act on it.”For other viral diseases as well, coinfections do not increase the disease severity, although in some cases they may increase the chances of viral pneumonia.“Future work is warranted to determine the importance and relevance of this process in infected humans,” Schwartz says. If the hybrid virus isn’t stable, or doesn’t provide a distinct immunological advantage, it won’t grow further, he adds.However, even with a low possibility of a hybrid virus forming in a co-infected patient, the new study provides evidence for a pathway that viruses can use to learn how to infect different cells. For example, a flu-RSV hybrid can expand the range of cells the flu virus alone can infect—nose, throat, and windpipe—to also include lung cells which are typically the target of RSV.“How often does that happen in nature? Probably not as often as we fear,” says Kamil. “But with billions of people, and animals on the planet, there's enough times that it may happen.”Related TopicsPUBLIC HEALTHEVOLUTIONYou May Also LikeSCIENCECan scientists ‘solve’ stress?

Almost 9 million people nationwide have been sickened by the flu already this season, RSV is surging among children, and COVID-19 continues to infect tens of thousands of people in the U.S. each day.But why does cold weather typically translate to cold and flu season? Experts often point to changes in human behavior—namely that chilly temperatures force people inside, where it’s easier for germs to spread. But a new study published in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology suggests another explanation can be found within our noses.As the body’s gateway to the outside world, the human nose is equipped with defenses meant to stop invaders, such as viruses and bacteria, in their tracks. In 2018, researchers from Boston’s Northeastern University, Massachusetts Eye and Ear (a teaching hospital affiliated with Harvard Medical School), and several other organizations described one of those shields in a paper also published in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. When the nose detects bacteria, they found, it releases a swarm of tiny fluid-filled sacs meant to attack and neutralize it.“When you kick a hornet’s nest, the hornets swarm out and try to kill whatever the attacker is before it can attack the nest,” says co-author Dr. Benjamin Bleier, director of otolaryngology translational research at Massachusetts Eye and Ear. “That’s what the body’s doing.”In the new study, Bleier and his collaborators show that the nose deploys similar defenses against common respiratory viruses, including two rhinoviruses (frequent causes of the common cold) and a coronavirus (though not the one that causes COVID-19). They also set out to answer another question: does cold weather dampen the effectiveness of the nose’s natural immune response?Previous research suggests common respiratory viruses thrive at lower temperatures. In 2015, a research team from Yale University used mice to demonstrate that rhinoviruses are better at replicating in colder temperatures because antiviral immune responses aren’t as strong under these conditions. Research from the National Institutes of Health has also shown that influenza viruses are better at spreading in chilly climates.The new paper builds on that earlier work by laying out a “true, quantitative, biologic explanation…of why the body is more susceptible to viral infections when being exposed to cold,” Bleier says.For the study, researchers measured the nasal temperatures of healthy human volunteers at about 74°F versus approximately 40°F. They found that the nasal cavity’s temperature dropped by about 9°F in the colder condition. Next, in the laboratory, they exposed nasal cell samples to a similar reduction in temperature, to mimic what actually happens within the nose in a cold climate. They found that the immune response was significantly blunted at the lower temperature.In addition to helping explain long-observed trends about respiratory viruses spiking during cold months, the finding could eventually lead to new therapeutics, says study co-author Mansoor Amiji, chairman of the department of pharmaceutical sciences at Northeastern. If researchers can find a way to boost the nose’s innate immune response, even under cold temperatures, they could feasibly stop more viral illnesses before they take root.“You only need to trigger that response locally to protect the rest of the body,” Bleier says. “It just speaks to how important the nasal cavity is.”More Must-Reads from TIMEHow Donald Trump WonThe Best Inventions of 2024Why Sleep Is the Key to Living LongerHow to Break 8 Toxic Communication HabitsNicola Coughlan Bet on Herself—And WonWhat It’s Like to Have Long COVID As a Kid22 Essential Works of Indigenous CinemaMeet TIME's Newest Class of Next Generation LeadersWrite to Jamie Ducharme at jamie.ducharme@time.comEdit PostHomeU.S.PoliticsWorldHealthBusinessTechPersonal Finance by TIME StampedShopping by TIME StampedFuture of Work by CharterEntertainmentIdeasScienceHistorySportsMagazineThe TIME VaultTIME For KidsTIMECO2CouponsTIME EdgeVideoMastheadNewslettersSubscribeDigital MagazineGive a GiftShop the TIME StoreCareersModern Slavery StatementPress RoomTIME StudiosU.S. & Canada Customer CareGlobal Help CenterContact the EditorsReprints and PermissionsSite MapMedia KitSupplied Partner ContentAbout Us© 2024 TIME USA, LLC.

Coroners Service confirmed five deaths, but Wednesday afternoon, the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) said it is aware of six influenza-associated deaths among children and youth.Numbers between agencies can vary based on how deaths are tracked and reported. For example, the cause of death in an influenza-related case could also be categorized as a death from strep throat or a bacterial infection. The B.C. Coroners Service said the data reflects investigations where influenza was identified as "either the immediate, antecedent or underlying cause of death or as a significant condition," and said none of the deaths were recorded in infants younger than one.Historical data provided by the B.C. Coroners Service showed the deaths represent a departure from previous flu seasons prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Between 2015 and 2019, B.C. recorded two to three influenza-related deaths in people aged 18 or younger every year. In 2020, the province recorded one death, while none were recorded in 2021.Dr. Anna Wolak, a family physician in Vancouver, said "children dying at a higher rate than what we are used to seeing in a typical flu season.""That is the hardest part of this at the moment. This is March 2020 for kids. We're seeing hospitals under strain. We're seeing cases rising,"The influenza season started weeks earlier than it normally does and is rising at a significant rate — the curve is almost vertical."B.C. Children's Hospital activates emergency overflow amid respiratory illness surgeEstimates of the number of annual flu deaths in Canada vary depending on the severity of the flu season, but doctors, including Wolak, have warned this year appears to be particularly severe. Children, especially young children, are at a higher risk of severe outcomes. Seniors are also at greater risk of complications.The BCCDC said in a statement, "Early findings indicate some of the children experienced secondary bacterial infections contributing to severe illness, which can be a complication of influenza. ""It is important to know that death associated with influenza in previously healthy children continues to be rare." It said children with chronic medical conditions are most at risk of severe outcomes and recommended all children aged six months and older receive a vaccination against influenza.WATCH | Dr. Anna Wolak talks about the flu's impact on children:Family physician Dr. Anna Wolak describes the spike in influenza cases among children2 years agoDuration 1:02Dr. Anna Wolak, a family physician in Vancouver, said doctors in the province are "hearing reports of children dying at a higher rate than what we are used to seeing in a typical flu season."'Dramatic increase' in influenza AThe warnings from doctors and the BCCDC come as wait times at emergency rooms across the province have continued to climb. Over the weekend, the estimated wait time to see a doctor at B.C. Children's Hospital was reported to be over 10 hours.Health Minister Adrian Dix said he couldn't comment on the individual cases but said he believed at least two of the cases involved teenagers."This is absolutely devastating for everyone in the health-care system and obviously and most importantly for the families involved," he said."It shows the significant dangers the flu can have for many children. It can be relatively mild [but] for some it can be fundamentally difficult, for those who are in critical care and those who pass away."While the province is on track for a record number of people getting their flu shot this year, Dr. Penny Ballem with B.C. Vaccine Operations says only 20 per cent of children under five have been vaccinated. (Ben Nelms/CBC)On Monday, health officials in B.C. urged parents to have children vaccinated, citing a "dramatic increase" in cases of influenza A, a strain which can cause severe illness in children. According to data collected by B.C. Vaccine Operations, only 20 per cent of children under five have been vaccinated.Pediatric influenza cases on the rise across CanadaWhile the deaths in B.C. are higher than those in the rest of the country, doctors across Canada have voiced similar concerns about a startling number of pediatric cases.In Alberta, two children have died of influenza since the start of the flu season. Kids up to the age of 19 account for nearly one-third of the province's flu-related ICU admissions, according to provincial data.Ontario recorded one child death from influenza in late November. Paul Roumeliotis, a pediatrician and the medical officer of health for Ontario's Eastern Health Unit, said Ontario is also experiencing an "unprecedented amount of children, particularly under 17 years of age, going into the emergency room and actually being admitted to hospital."Health officials urge parents to have children vaccinated amid 'dramatic increase' in flu casesJesse Papenburg, a pediatric infectious-disease specialist at Montreal Children's Hospital said the spike in cases is also been seen in Quebec. He said that early in the influenza season, younger children tend to get infected first before spreading it to other parts of the population, including the elderly."I think principally we're seeing more severe cases because of the volume. We're also noticing an increase in the amount of secondary bacterial infections that we're seeing," said Papenburg."It seems that we're seeing more of these bacterial infections on top of kids who have influenza or other respiratory viruses."The annual FluWatch report showed that in the 2018-2019 influenza season indicated that nationally, 10 child deaths were recorded, all of them associated with influenza A.ABOUT THE AUTHORMichelle GhoussoubReporter, CBC NewsMichelle Ghoussoub is a reporter and anchor for CBC News based in Vancouver.

Throughout 2021, flu infection rates remained low as most Americans reduced exposure to COVID- 19 while waiting to get their vaccinations or their boosters. Other diseases spread by human contact and generally experienced at low levels throughout the year also saw reduced spread, but that also led to reduced immunity in the general population as these viruses continued to mutate. Now, at the end of 2022, as most Americans have returned to pre-pandemic norms, world travel has been restored and more people in industrialized economies have decided to “catch up” on missed travel from the previous two years, viruses normally kept in check are flaring up with a vengeance. Flu, respiratory syncytial virus and various strains of COVID-19 are all spiking this winter. The three viruses are unrelated, so developing immunity to or getting a vaccine for one or two won’t protect you from the others. RSV causes cold-like symptoms but can be serious for infants and older adults, according to the AHA. Influenza is predicted to be particularly bad this winter. Writing from personal experience, the 2022-2023 flu season is here, and it’s unpleasant. I’m back at work after taking a day off last week, but I spent the weekend with my wife taking care of our three sick children, all three of whom just got over confirmed bouts of RSV. Staying up with two infant twins both coughing and wheezing is nerve-wracking. I’m terrible when I’m sick, so I can confidently say that my wife is a saint. According to the CDC, people infected with RSV usually show symptoms within 4 to 6 days of becoming infected. Symptoms of RSV infection usually include runny nose, a decrease in appetite, coughing, sneezing, fever and wheezing. These symptoms usually appear in stages rather than all at once. In very young infants with RSV, the only symptoms may be irritability, decreased activity and breathing difficulties.

There is no specific treatment for RSV infection, though researchers are working to develop vaccines and antivirals. Almost all children will have had an RSV infec­tion by their second birthday. Because of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, many children did not catch RSV in 2020 and 2021, so it is hitting children and toddlers particularly hard this season. Influenza can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. Flu symptoms usually come on suddenly. People who have flu often experience a cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches and fatigue. Some people may have fever or feeling feverish, chills. Vomiting and diarrhea is more common in children than adults. Influenza A replication cycle. The virus recognizes specific receptors expressed on the host cell surface using HA and enters cells via endocytosis. After fusion of the viral envelope and endosomal membrane, vRNPs are released into the cytoplasm and translocate into the nucleus to initiate replication. RdRP is responsible for both viral mRNA transcription and vRNA replication. Newly synthesized vRNPs are exported to the cytoplasm, and assembly of progeny virions occurs near the plasma membrane. NA facilitates budding of new virions from host cells. Anti-influenza drugs inhibit various steps of the influenza virus replication cycle.Courtesy Hi Eun Jung and Heung Kyu Lee People report a wide range of COVID-19 symptoms that may appear two to 14 days after exposure. Possible symptoms include fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, impaired cognition, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting and diarrhea. The symptoms of COVID-19, and their frequency. Courtesy Mikael Häggström, M.D. The CDC offers tips to protect yourself and others from these viruses and help stop the spread of other germs: Avoid close contact with people who are sick. When you are sick, keep your distance from others to protect them from getting sick too. If possible, stay home from work, school and errands when you are sick. This will help prevent spreading your illness to others. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing. It may prevent those around you from getting sick. Flu viruses are spread mainly by droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze or talk. Washing your hands often will help protect you against germs. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub. Germs can be spread when a person touches something that is contaminated with germs and then touches his or her eyes, nose or mouth. Clean and disinfect frequently-touched surfaces at home, work or school, especially when someone is ill. Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious food.

Stay up to speed on the latest BVN news. Sign up RSV was discovered in 1956 and has been recognized as a common and seasonal respiratory illness, mostly among children, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). RSV symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, wheezing and in young infants, difficulty breathing.In combination with the COVID-19 pandemic and an early flu season, higher than normal cases and hospitalizations of RSV have been reported by hospitals across the state. According to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), the number of children who need hospitalization is currently outpacing hospitals’ ability to expand the number of pediatric beds available. The department noted that hospitals typically have about 35% to 40% open pediatric intensive care unit beds, but that number is down to about 20% statewide.“RSV and flu, and now COVID-19, are on the rise – leading to the hospitalization of our youngest and most vulnerable Californians who need all of us to help protect them,” said State Public Health Officer and CDPH Director Dr. Tomás Aragón in a statement.On Dec. 1, Riverside County reported the county’s first child flu-related death. The child was under the age of 10 and passed away at a local hospital where he was taken with respiratory symptoms. Health officials stated the child had been ill for a few days and tested positive for both influenza and RSV.Black Voice News and IE Voice spoke with pediatric infectious disease specialist and health journalist, who does clinical work at Harbor UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, Dr. ChrisAnna Mink, to discuss the atypical winter season as hospitals battle a triple threat of viruses. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Dr. ChrisAnna Mink, who does clinical work at Harbor UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, discusses the atypical winter season as hospitals battle a triple threat of viruses. (source: centerforhealthjournalism.org).BVN/ IE Voice: Can you begin by giving a brief breakdown of what the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is and what happens when the virus enters the body?Dr. Mink: RSV is one of the most common respiratory viruses for humans. Actually, humans are the only ones that get infected with RSV. It particularly causes problems for the very young and for the elderly. By age two, almost all kids on the planet have had some infection with RSV. For most of us, even for the little ones, it’s basically a cold, runny nose, a little cough, maybe a little fever, and in a week, you’re better. However, for teeny tinies — those under six months, especially those younger than two months — it can be quite devastating in that it doesn’t just stay in your upper respiratory tract, it gets down into your lungs and your lower respiratory tract. So, you’ll hear people say, ‘we had a cough that just wouldn’t stop’ or ‘my baby was wheezing,’ all kinds of symptoms that just make it hard for oxygen to get down into their lungs. And that’s why it causes such significant problems for the littles.This however, can also happen in any age group for people that have compromised immune systems or some heart or lung problems, and also for the elderly.What happens is this virus kind of gets in from big respiratory droplets…[​​and] all of those little drops coming out of your respiratory tree can carry the virus. If you’re in close contact with someone, another human can give it to another human. The other way it can happen is if someone, and especially we see this with kids, if they put their respiratory droplets on the table or something and then you happen to touch it. It can live on that table or toy for a few hours and some data suggest up to 24 hours.BVN/ IE Voice: From what I understand, RSV has been around for a while, but recently, California is experiencing higher cases than previous years. Can you explain why that may be?Dr. Mink: We like to say it comes sometime between Halloween and Thanksgiving, and then it peaks up in the winter, January and February, and then tends to be gone, most of the time, by April. I don’t know where it goes the rest of the year. But this year is really different and a question I’m asked a lot by parents is ‘what’s going on?’Over the last two years, because of COVID, we did a lot of things with really conscientious hand washing and masking. Well, that not only kept away COVID, it kept away a lot of the other usual winter respiratory viruses. So, we haven’t seen a lot of RSV, or even a lot of influenza, in 2020 and 2021. Once everybody took their masks off and got back together, all those viruses have come back with a vengeance, and that’s what we’re seeing. One of the highest rates of RSV is about 25 [cases] per 100,000 people, and we tend to hang probably maybe a fourth of that. It’s really out of control this year.According to Dr. ChrisAnna Mink who does clinical work at Harbor UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, once everyone took their masks off and got back together, all those viruses have come back with a vengeance. (source: MIT.com).I have a teeny bit of good news for you. From the CDC data, it looks like maybe RSV has peaked and it’s maybe coming down a little bit. However, we really don’t know what’s going to happen with the holidays and everybody getting back together.The bad news I have for you is that influenza is at one of those highest levels since maybe like 10 years [ago], like the 2009 pandemic that we had. So influenza, including in California, is at one of the highest rates we’ve seen in a long time. More bad news: COVID is also going up. BVN/ IE Voice: Are you noticing any trends among children with RSV such as a specific age group who is more vulnerable?Dr. Mink: About one to two per cent of all children born in the US end up with hospitalization with RSV. It’s something that we’ve dealt with forever. This year, we’re seeing a lot more hospitalizations or we have seen a lot more hospitalizations. Things have quieted down a little bit last week. I hope it stays that way.I have to say not really a big difference from usual. And that usual being the kids that I mentioned to you: [children under six months of age], the ones that are very young and the ones that have some underlying health problems. The bigger kids, in association with asthma, is one of our big concerns because — it’s really interesting — kids that have had RSV are more likely to have asthma as they get bigger.Here we are decades later, and the viruses are just smarter than we are. They will find ways to get into our bodies, unless we have some really good defenses. Right now, RSV is still smarter than we are.BVN/ IE Voice: Do we have any defenses against RSV at all?Dr. Mink: Those mitigation steps that we all learned so well for COVID work. Wear your mask. Wash your hands. Keep your distance from people, especially if they’re ill, and if you’re the one that’s ill, stay home because we have so many viruses circulating. Some of them are really devastating like long COVID, and even influenza, can lead to death, especially if you have some underlying problem.Actually, even for COVID, with our rates increasing, the CDC has put Los Angeles County and most of California, actually, back in medium risk and have officially recommended that mask wearing be done again in public or if you’re in a group with the holidays coming up.For RSV, there’s a monoclonal antibody. I know we’ve heard a lot about monoclonal antibodies for COVID. There’s one that’s been around a long time that we use on infants that have really high risk for hospitalization and death and those are the teeny tiny, premature babies. Something to talk to your doctor about is what should I do to protect my baby from RSV? Also, I’m going to really encourage everyone to get their flu and COVID vaccines because the flu is devastating. So far this year, we’ve already had 14 kid deaths due to influenza this season in the country.Dr. ChrisAnna Mink, who does clinical work at Harbor UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, encourages everyone to get their flu vaccine. (source: nfid.org).There’s some RSV vaccines in the works for research. There’s a couple that look pretty promising. I think Pfizer, one of the big makers of the COVID vaccine, is going to submit an application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for review of their RSV vaccine.BVN/ IE Voice: We talked about the way these viruses come seasonally, so can we expect for numbers to drop, not only for RSV, but also influenza and COVID?Dr. Mink: If it were a typical season, I could say, ‘Yeah, Breanna, by February, these things are going to start declining.’ Things are weird. COVID comes and goes. So far, we haven’t figured out any particular pattern other than that if you’re immunized, the less likely you are to get severe disease, hospitalized or death, [but it] doesn’t totally protect you from getting it.I don’t know what’s going to happen with COVID. With influenza, the season has started really early. We’ve been dealing with it since the fall and it’s still climbing. Typically, we peak in January, February.I guess a better way to say it is that none of them are following their usual behaviors, so I don’t know what’s going to come.BVN/ IE Voice: Anything else you’d like to add?Dr. Mink: [For] Black and White babies under 12 months, there’s equal issues. There’s so many things that happen more frequently for Black babies, and it’s not the case for those under 12 months. What happens for the older kids, there is a little higher rate for kids of African American descent. The thinking is that it’s not genetic, but that a lot of those things that put you at increased risk for asthma [like] living near highways, living [with] lower socioeconomic status, living with air pollution, crowded conditions — there seems to be an increased risk of RSV for the bigger kids.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 34,000 positive flu tests were reported from labs around the U.S. for the week ending Nov. 26, more than have been reported in any single week during any flu season on record, going back as far as 1997.On Friday, the Illinois Department of Public Health reported COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses are continuing to rise across the state following the Thanksgiving holiday, with 74 counties at an elevated level for COVID-19 by the Center for Disease Control.“Illinois is experiencing a significant rise in communities at elevated risk levels for COVID-19, including 29 counties at a high risk,” said IDPH Director Dr. Sameer Vohra. “These elevated COVID-19 community levels, along with rising flu levels, are leading to a surge of respiratory infections and increased hospitalizations. I recommend all Illinoisians - and especially those most vulnerable including young children and individuals over 65 - take all preventative steps to protect themselves, their families and friends."Sangamon, Menard, Macoupin, Morgan, Montgomery, Logan, and Christian are among counties with high risk of COVID-19 transmissions, according to the CDC.Dick Austin, former Sangamon County board chairman and top GSA administrator dies at 74Memorial Health officials reported 950 positive influenza tests last week in its ambulatory clinics. Some of those facilities had to close early because of the crush of patients.Memorial Health hospitals reported 104 patients hospitalized with flu, compared to four at this time last year. Those hospitals include Springfield, Taylorville, Lincoln, Jacksonville and Decatur.HSHS System doesn't typically release such numbers, said spokeswoman Jennifer Snopko.The most prevalent strain of flu, said Dr. Anna Richie, clinical director of Memorial Health's Urgent Care facilities, is "A" with patients reporting headaches, muscle aches, fever, cough and congestion among other symptoms."It's not too late to vaccinate for COVID-19 or flu," Richie said. "We still have a long winter ahead of us. We have several months of flu season. We know in the next several months, there will be times people will be in group settings, close together, in an enclosed area and most of the time people aren't going to have their masks on."Typically, December is when the flu season kicks in, said Dr. Subhash Chaudhary, chairman of infection prevention at HSHS St. John’s Hospital in Springfield.While many years the flu season peaks in January, it can fluctuate, Chaudhary said."Every year, a new vaccine becomes available in September, and we recommend (people six months or older) take the vaccine," Chaudhary said. "That's the most important thing a person can do to prevent this disease and its complications besides handwashing and wearing a mask if you have symptoms."The flu vaccine can be taken in conjunction with the COVID vaccines, Chaudhary added, but at this stage, health officials don't have a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which has been on the rise, especially among children.Richie said even for a clinician who has been practicing for many years, it is difficult recognizing which respiratory virus a person might have."The testing is important to help us: oh, you're positive for COVID, or, oh, you're positive for flu or oh, you're positive for strep because they can all mimic and look like each other," she said.In addition to scheduling flu vaccinations, Richie said, people should wash their hands regularly, avoid touching eyes, nose or mouth, wear a mask around large groups of people and stay home when feeling ill.Contact Steven Spearie: 217-622-1788, sspearie@sj-r.com, twitter.com/@StevenSpearie.

Canadian health officials are encouraging more uptake of influenza vaccines by children this season. (Flavio Lo Scalzo/Reuters)Social SharingFlu infections are raging among children and hospitalizing them across Canada, say pediatricians who are calling for urgent and longer-term solutions.Last weekend, hospitals across the country were forced to scale back regular service to deal with a surge in influenza illnesses: CHEO in Ottawa said the Red Cross will be deployed to help out with its surge of cases. A respite care facility in Calgary closed to redeploy staff to a children's hospital. BC Children's Hospital declared an emergency for 30 minutes on Saturday to quickly boost capacity and resources. Newfoundland and Labrador's children's hospital cancelled some scheduled surgeries and appointments. Doctors say the moves reflect a surge in influenza on top of long-standing pressures on both pediatric hospitals and care providers in the community. Cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) have, in the meantime, stabilized after spiking earlier this season. For the week ending Dec. 3, a total of six influenza-associated deaths were reported among adults, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada's FluWatch report.In the same week, participating provinces and territories reported 212 influenza-associated hospitalizations and 31 ICU admissions among children 16 and under.That's up from an average of 11 influenza hospitalizations, with a maximum of 35, at pediatric hospitals from 2014-15 to 2019-20, said Dr. Jesse Papenburg, a pediatric infectious-disease specialist at Montreal Children's Hospital."This shows that we have had an early and intense influenza season so far this year, hitting the pediatric population particularly hard," he said in an email.Across Canada, influenza activity continues to remain higher than expected for this time of year, the FluWatch report said.Cases of respiratory syncytial virus have stabilized after spiking earlier this season. (Martha Irvine/Associated Press)Similarly in the U.S., Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Monday that flu is at its highest level that country has seen for a decade. So far this season, 21 children and youth in the U.S. have died.In Canada this season, five influenza-associated pediatric deaths have been reported federally, as of Dec. 3. Annually, the number of deaths for that age group were in the single digits before the COVID-19 pandemic.Bend the curve with flu shotsInfluenza is "overwhelmingly … causing a lot of problems," particularly for children under five, said Dr. Fatima Kakkar, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at Ste. Justine's Hospital in Montreal.But it's not necessarily the flu, alone, that's the problem, she says.Rather, kids catch the flu, which leaves them prone to "really significant bacterial infections," like pneumonia — and that's when they land in hospital. Kakkar says she'd like to see an emphasis on influenza vaccination for children, including publicity campaigns.A surge in flu cases and other respiratory illnesses led BC Children's Hospital to declare an emergency for 30 minutes on Saturday to quickly boost capacity and resources. (Justine Boulin/CBC)"I say this because I think it's not too late and especially in parts of the country where influenza hasn't taken hold, I would really like to see people encouraging and making it easier for parents and their children to be vaccinated."Whitehorse-based pediatrician Dr. Katharine Smart called it "immensely concerning" that children who are acutely ill and need attention quickly are having trouble receiving it.But there are other, bigger-picture problems throughout the pediatric health-care system that deserve attention, she says.Smart, a past president of the Canadian Medical Association, cites wait-times for surgery for young people with scoliosis, or curvature of the spine, as an example."I've had patients that had to put off their post-secondary school planning because they don't know when they're going to get the operation and the recovery," Smart said. "They say, 'Well, how do I go off to college if I don't know that I'm going to now have to have a massive spine surgery and be out of commission for weeks or months?'" she said. "Some of these [teens] have been waiting three to four years for this operation." Effective vaccineOther health-care needs for children are provided outside of the hospital, which is especially important in the first years of life, such as autism services. Some kids aren't able to access services to improve their speech, social skills and cognition. Once a child is in kindergarten, they may no longer be eligible for certain help because the developmental window to intervene has closed."These are problems that we're seeing across the country," Smart said. She suggests bolstering nurse staffing and retention. She also wants to see more uptake of the flu vaccine among children and adults, to "bend the curve" for overwhelmed health-care systems. The good news, Papenburg says, is that the influenza A H3N2 strain that is mainly circulating in Canada now is genetically the same as the strain in this year's influenza vaccine. "That bodes well for good vaccine effectiveness, although that needs to be assessed in field studies now underway."In the long term, researchers are evaluating newer vaccine technologies for better, longer-lasting flu immunization, he said.Like Smart, Papenburg suggested governments "invest in our child health care systems capacity, so that we can better handle these types of unpredictable surges of infections in our pediatric population."Young and old more likely to face severe flu. Here's why doctors think it happensAlberta's flu season one of the worst in decades, expert cautions"When you look at Canada, we rank 30th out of 38 countries for childhood well-being," Smart said. "It's really shocking to think a country, as wealthy as ours, is doing that poorly for our kids, but it's because we do not have a strategy for children." Health officials also recommend that people mask in indoor public places, screen daily for respiratory symptoms, stay home when sick, practice hand hygiene and keep surfaces clean to reduce the spread of respiratory illnesses such as RSV and flu.ABOUT THE AUTHORAmina ZafarJournalistAmina Zafar covers medical sciences and health care for CBC.

Moscow School District Superintendent Greg Bailey said most parents reported flu-like symptoms. On Thursday, absenteeism was around 26%. Bailey says he hopes the three-day break will be enough to slow the spread.“I would remind people that it doesn’t hurt for them to have their kids wear masks, if they feel comfortable doing that,” he said. “We’re not making it mandatory. But as we saw with COVID, it did reduce cases.”Bailey also encouraged parents to limit their children’s exposure to large groups where they might be more likely to get sick.Other Moscow schools will remain open. Moscow High School had 7.4% absenteeism on Thursday. Lena Whitmore Elementary had 11%, McDonald Elementary 13%, Russell Elementary 10% and West Park Elementary had 12% absenteeism.While schools expect an increase of sickness-related absences in the fall and winter, Bailey said 30 is unusually high.“We’ve had 18, 19 percent, [those] are the numbers I remember,” he said. “Sometime I’m sure we’ve had in the very low 20s.”Nurses for the Clarkston, Lewiston and Pullman school districts said they’ve experienced an increase in absentee rates due to illness, but not unusually high or enough to close schools. The Tekoa School District announced on Wednesday they would cancel all in-person learning at the junior and senior high school for two days due to 25% absenteeism related to sickness.Mike Larson, a nurse for Public Health Idaho North Central District, said many of the cases are likely influenza, though COVID-19 and RSV are also present in the community. “This is [the] influenza time of year. Generally, we see our influenza [type] A cases usually pick up in December or January,” said Larson. “But, you know, this may be a little bit of an odd year and it seems like we had a little bit of an earlier start to the game.”Recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention list a “very high” influenza activity level in Washington, Idaho and Oregon.“Right now we’re seeing a decent amount of influenza A locally,” said Whitman County Public Health Director Chris Skidmore. “RSV is starting to crest a little bit with influenza starting to take its place.”Although the flu season started early, Larson said, it’s not too late to get vaccinated.“We’ve heard that it’s both type A and type B influenza that are circulating right now. So that’s a good reminder for people to get their influenza vaccine, if they haven’t already. Nationally, they’re telling us that the vaccine this year is a good match for the types of virus that they’re seeing circulate,” he said.Pullman Regional Hospital reported they’d treated numerous influenza patients recently, including roughly five people in the past week ranging in age from 30 to 80-years-old.At Gritman Medical Center in Moscow, Nicole Wheaton, emergency department director, said flu and other respiratory-related ER visits have been on the rise since September.“We are seeing a large increase in respiratory illnesses. A lot of flu, a lot of RSV, some others,” said Wheaton. “Especially in the ER.”Though many influenza cases don’t require hospitalization, people having trouble breathing or showing signs of trouble maintaining oxygenation should seek medical care.“If they are critically ill, or if they are having difficulty maintaining their oxygenation, if they have blue lips, or if they’re short of breath, they probably should be consulting their provider to see if they need testing, and, or, treatment for these illnesses,” he said.This report is made possible by the Lewis-Clark Valley Healthcare Foundation in partnership with Northwest Public Broadcasting, the Lewiston Tribune and the Moscow-Pullman Daily News.

Video Ad Feedback Triple threat emerging: flu, Covid, RSV 02:52 - Source: CNN CNN — This year’s flu shot appears to be “a very good match” to the circulating strains, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said at a news briefing Monday. However, she noted that flu vaccinations are lagging behind the pace of previous years. Through the end of October, CDC data shows that vaccinations for pregnant women, a group that is more vulnerable to severe illness from influenza, are down about 12% from the same point in 2021.

Lumeez Ismail/peopleimages.com/Adobe Stock Here's how to know when your child is too sick for school Vaccination rates for seniors, the age group most likely to be hospitalized with influenza, were down about 3 percentage points from October 2021. Flu vaccinations for children are down about 5% compared with where they were before the Covid-19 pandemic, Walensky said. In a typical year, about 60% of American adults get vaccinated against influenza. Flu hits the US hard Flu season has gotten off to an early and severe start in the US, with hospitalization rates hitting levels that typically aren’t seen until December or January. “We, of course, look in real time as to how well we think the influenza match is to what is circulating right now. The good news is that looks like it is a very good match,” Walensky said of the early start to the respiratory virus season. She noted that the CDC would have more definitive data later in the season but that the data is encouraging.

Flushots 20220921 Bh Bryon Houlgrave/The Register/USA Today Network Flu season continues to intensify in the US, and holiday gatherings could make it worse Walensky said that even when the vaccine doesn’t closely match the circulating flu strains, “We see a 35% decrease in rates of hospitalization … which really just emphasizes, when we do have a good match, how much more effective it will be.” CDC data shows that nearly 20,000 people in the United States were admitted to the hospital for flu during the week of Thanksgiving, almost double the number of admissions from the week before. Covid-19 hospitalizations have ticked up as well, rising 27% in the week after Thanksgiving. But Covid-19 is no longer the only virus straining hospitals. Just 5% of the US population lives in an area considered to have a high Covid-19 community level. girl blowing his nose into handkerchief isolated Maxim Ibragimov/Acobe Stock It seems like everyone's getting sick this winter. Parents and health care workers, how are you coping? Walensky said Monday that the CDC was “actively looking into” expanding its community levels beyond Covid-19 to include the effects of other viruses, such as the flu. “In the meantime, what I do want to say is, one need not take wait for CDC action in order to put a mask,” she said. People who are sick should stay home and away from others, use good hygiene like covering coughs and washing hands frequently, use a high-quality mask and improve the ventilation in indoor spaces, Walensky said. Treatment is available If you do get sick, it’s important to get tested, even if you’ve been vaccinated, said Dr. Sandra Fryhofer, board chair of the American Medical Association and an internal medicine physician in Atlanta. If you have Covid-19 or the flu, there are antiviral medications for both. But flu antivirals don’t work against Covid-19, and vice versa.

Schaben/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images Children's health leaders call for emergency response as respiratory viruses continue to spread across the US “It is going to be a confusing respiratory infections season. Figuring out what’s making people sick is going to be a conundrum,” Fryhofer said. In response to a question about shortages of key medications during this rough virus season, Walensky said that “CDC is aware of the reports of some of the shortages for both antivirals as well as antibiotics across the country. I know FDA is working…with manufacturers to try and explore what can be done to address this.” She also urged doctors not to prescribe antibiotics for illnesses caused by viruses. Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, said he and his colleagues have been astonished by the steep increase in flu cases this season. They have also wondered what could be causing it. Doctor giving vaccine, flu or influenza shot to patient with injection needle. Close up of arm and medical professional.

Terovesalainen/Adobe Stock As respiratory viruses strain US health care systems, Biden administration tells states how it's ready to help He says it’s likely that after two years without much flu activity in the US, we lost some of our immunity against that virus just as the country has returned to more normal travel and activity patterns. “Some of it has got to do with our behaviors in the past, having avoided flu and now opening up our lives to activities such as travel, religious services, getting together with families, going out to entertainment venues and doing all those things that take us into groups,” he said. The flu vaccines are good at preventing severe outcomes, he said, but they don’t do much to stop the virus’ spread. “It keeps you out of the emergency room, the hospital, the intensive care unit and the cemetery. It’s not very good at interrupting transmission, and it is not very good at preventing milder infection,” he said.

Schaffner says it’s likely that flu hospitalizations are going up because the virus is hitting the elderly, who, on the whole, tend to get less protection from vaccinations. “The vaccine works least well among the population we most want to protect, namely older people, and that’s because they have immune systems that are much less robust than the immune systems of younger people.” Schaffner noted that there are high-dose vaccines for seniors, which are preferred for this age group to help increase their protection.

By allowing pharmacies to administer the vaccine, the DoH is continuing its efforts to increase the accessibility to preventive healthcare services, in order to maintain the health and safety of all community members and avoid the spread of the virus. With several pharmacies approved to administer flu shots to date, DoH encourages members of the community to get vaccinated, as it is one of the most effective ways to prevent seasonal influenza. The Department is working closely with pharmacies in different areas of the Emirate to ensure the availability of vaccines in primary neighbourhoods. The pharmacies include Al Manara Pharmacy at YAS Mall, Al Thiqa Al Almyiah, Al Thiqa Al Dowaliah and different branches of Al Ain Pharmacy. All individuals over the age of 18 are eligible for the influenza vaccine, which is free for Thiqa health insurance holders, health care professionals at high risk of infection, and pregnant women. Elderly people over the age of 50 years old, Haj and Umrah pilgrims. H.E Hind Mubarak Al Zaabi, Executive Director Healthcare Facilities Sector at Department of Health– Abu Dhabi said: “At the Department of Health, our motto has always been prevention is better than cure – therefore we encourage all community members to focus on leading a healthy lifestyle complemented with preventive measures to avoid illness. Reiterating Abu Dhabi’s position as a leading destination for healthcare, DoH is committed to equipping the healthcare sector at large with all the means to provide individuals with a seamless and convenient healthcare experience in the Emirate.” On this occasion HE Dr Farida Al Hosany the Executive Director of Infectious Disease Sector said: “The seasonal flu vaccine has been proven to be effective to prevent influenza with a high success rate. In partnership with strategic partners Abu Dhabi Public Health Center takes proactive measures to reduce the spread of influenza infections in the community, by implementing awareness and educational campaigns to raise the level of awareness of the public and health workers about the disease and the importance of vaccination. The center also has an electronic system to track influenza cases in the community. DOH adaptation of group of pharmacies to provide influenza vaccination service will extend receiving the vaccine on wider range.” As part of its efforts to combat the spread of COVID-19, DoH began to administer vaccines and offer PCR testing at pharmacies last July to ensure the availability and accessibility of healthcare solutions to all community members. The Department is calling on the public to take the seasonal influenza vaccine ahead of the onset of the winter season, starting in December, during which this type of flu becomes more contagious. Seasonal influenza is a disease caused by influenza viruses, which mainly affect the respiratory system, specifically the nose and the pharynx. The symptoms range from mild to severe, where a majority of patients diagnosed with influenza require between a few days and up to two weeks to recover from infection. Those affected may develop exacerbated inflammation of the lungs, ear, sinuses, or general deterioration of the health. The flu may also cause severe complications in young children, pregnant women, the elderly, and individuals with chronic illnesses or weak immunity. Vaccination is considered the most effective method of seasonal flu prevention. It protects against common viruses that cause the influenza and is updated annually to ensure continuous immunity. Individuals are protected for up to two weeks from the date of receiving the vaccination. Approximately 70,000 influenza vaccines were distributed in September and October 2022 in Abu Dhabi.

A top doctor with the IWK Health Centre in Halifax, Nova Scotia, says the early start along with the severity of cases could mean a hectic holiday season, especially if work isn’t done to cut down on the spread.Dr. Andrew Lynk is the Chief and Chair of Pediatrics at the IWK. He says the hospital is seeing an unprecedented number of kids with respiratory viruses like the flu and Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection (RSV) because they weren’t exposed during the pandemic. COVID-19 is also still making the rounds along with the common cold.“So we’re getting slammed because a lot of kids under the age of five didn’t see the flu, haven’t seen RSV,” Lynk says. Story continues below advertisement “So in addition to the normal young ones under the age of one or two who would never have seen it because they weren’t born, you’ve got that older group who haven’t seen it. So it’s kind of a double whammy in terms of the volume and the numbers of kids who are getting quite sick.”A new report from the province shows cases of the flu are continuing to climb amongst most age groups.It has released its latest Respiratory Watch report, which shows 673 new influenza cases were identified between November 27 to December 3. 4:37 Influenza claims the lives of 6 B.C. children The one exception is those aged five to 19, with that age group seeing a decline when compared to the previous report, from 166 to 146. However, Lynk says the report only contains cases that have been reported, adding that the spread in the community is likely much higher. Story continues below advertisement The IWK’s emergency room has been seeing a steady stream of visits from sick kids and their parents, according to Lynk.

Nova Scotians should continue to take steps to protect themselves and loved ones from the spread of respiratory illness.”The department also says it’s recommended Nova Scotians wear a mask to protect themselves and others when they are in a crowded, indoor place or feel sick.During a press conference in late November, the province’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Robert Strang, said the tools used to curb the spread of COVID-19 were deployed to help get a grip on a new and serious virus. He explained those tools weren’t necessary for the flu when discussing the early start to the season. Story continues below advertisement “I’ve discussed masking mandates with this team and we are in strong agreement that at this time masking mandates would not be necessary or effective,” Strang said at the time. “However, we will continue to monitor our situation and would certainly change our position if we felt it was necessary.”A letter from Dr. Stang was sent home to families of students on Monday. He recommended, given the rise in respiratory viruses, ensuring families are vaccinated. He also advised staying home when you’re sick and wearing a mask if feeling unwell in public spaces.According to the Respiratory Watch report, there have been 15 deaths so far this season where the individuals had a positive influenza test result.The report says influenza may or may not have been the major contributing cause of death or hospitalization.

Amid warnings of a “tripledemic” in the US and UK, how much should we worry about influenza in Singapore? Now is the best time to get a flu vaccine, says Duke-NUS’ Yvonne Su. (File photo: iStock/Shelyna Long) Yvonne Su Yvonne Su 10 Dec 2022 06:00AM (Updated: 10 Dec 2022 07:27AM) Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE: It’s that time of year when it seems like everyone you know has been falling sick. But isn’t it “just the flu”? Influenza activity has been on the rise across the globe since September. The United States and the United Kingdom are bracing for bad flu seasons in the current winter months, with health authorities already seeing an earlier-than-usual surge in cases. They warn of a “tripledemic” where the concurrent outbreaks of COVID-19, flu and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) could pile on pressure to the healthcare system. Should Singapore be bracing for a bad flu season as well? Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said on Sunday (Dec 4) that a new COVID-19 wave is expected around the end of the year. Influenza activity usually peaks in the winter months elsewhere. In Singapore, we experience year-round circulation of influenza virus, with two prominent peaks from May to July and from December to February, coinciding with the rainy seasons. Singapore’s influenza activity typically increases around the year-end, with the December school holidays and festive celebrations including Christmas and New Year tend to involve travelling overseas or gathering in large groups. Travelling to colder destinations in the Northern Hemisphere where influenza transmission is active could also mean people catch the flu and carry the virus when they return. Travellers walk through a transit hall at Changi Airport in Singapore on May 13, 2022. (File photo: AFP/Roslan Rahman) The reality is that seasonal influenza is associated with 290,000 to 650,000 deaths globally every year. Studies have shown that hospitalisation rate in Singapore is 50.1 per 100,000 person-years, but higher rates are found in young children and the elderly aged over 65 years. RESPIRATORY ILLNESSES BACK WITH A VENGEANCE Experts have been warning that common respiratory illnesses could return with a vengeance as pandemic measures are lifted. Strategies, including aggressive testing, travel restrictions, lockdowns and mask wearing, were effective in controlling the transmission of not only the coronavirus but also influenza and other respiratory viruses such as RSV. The number of influenza cases dramatically dropped during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to almost zero circulation of human influenza viruses for more than two years. Together with lower rates of influenza vaccination, this likely resulted in waning population immunity, making all of us more susceptible as influenza strains resume global circulation. Another reason could be due to the dominant H3N2 subtype this time round. The burden of influenza varies from season to season, depending on the prevalent strain. At present, there are four subtypes of influenza viruses circulating among us: Two subtypes of influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and two of influenza B (Victoria and Yamagata). Of the four, H3N2 viruses typically have a faster rate of mutation. Similar to SARS-CoV-2 virus, influenza viruses are RNA viruses that mutate with time and generate new variants. Like the coronavirus and its spike protein, influenza subtypes are characterised by the hemagglutinin protein (such as H3 in H3N2) which binds to the cell to cause infection. Mutations in this protein can enable the virus to evade our immune system. This means the H3N2 strain in the influenza vaccine will need to be updated more frequently or risk becoming less effective against the current circulating viruses. Related: Commentary: COVID-19 has created an ‘immunity debt’ towards common infections in our children Commentary: Flu will return with vengeance after all-time low during COVID-19 EFFECTIVE VACCINES AGAINST INFLUENZA The good news is that there are effective vaccines against influenza, the so-called quadrivalent vaccines, as they contain - and thus confer protection against - the four subtypes, whichever becomes the dominant one each season. But given the time needed to manufacture the vaccines, the World Health Organization consults global scientific experts to determine the strains that will make up the vaccine for the upcoming flu season – twice a year to recommend the composition for vaccines in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. How well-matched the vaccine strains are to the circulating viruses affects the vaccine effectiveness. This season, the prevalent H3N2 virus belongs genetically to a group or clade called 3C.2a1b.2a2. Current vaccines for both the 2022-2023 Northern and 2023 Southern Hemispheres influenza seasons contain a H3N2 strain of this clade and should provide protection against the circulating viruses – no matter which flu vaccine your doctor stocks. As we hit the holiday and peak travel seasons, flu shots can be taken around two weeks ahead of travel plans to allow our bodies to develop the necessary immune response. Due to its mutating strains, flu vaccine formulas must be regularly updated and only offer limited protection currently AFP/JOE RAEDLE HOW ABOUT MORE INFLUENZA TESTING? The pandemic has shone the spotlight on diagnostic testing as a key tool to fight COVID-19 and normalised self-testing. Given similar antigen rapid test (ART) kits exist for influenza, could doing more influenza testing help? With COVID-19 now treated as endemic, incorporating influenza diagnostic testing would be useful to differentiate if the sick person is infected with flu, SARS-CoV-2 or neither. Knowing what virus can help the doctors to make early precisions in prescribing suitable antiviral medications for treatment, as some anti-viral influenza drugs work best within 48 hours of symptom onset. In addition, early diagnosis and treatment can help to reduce the health burden including complications of diseases and rates of hospitalisation. It comes down to cost and practicality. Who would bear the costs of self-test kits? Is there a need to test everyone who shows signs of respiratory illness? For a healthy individual who is up to date with their flu and COVID-19 vaccinations, the illness would be generally mild and self-limiting if infected with either virus. Related: Commentary: People think they don’t need a fourth COVID-19 vaccine shot. They’re wrong Testing could be better targeted at highly vulnerable groups who risk severe clinical outcomes if infected with influenza, including young children, the elderly, pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals and people with chronic medical conditions. TOWARDS A COMBINED COVID-FLU SHOT The next key question will be whether different rules should be applied for COVID-19-positive versus flu-positive cases. Currently, people with COVID-19 are told to stay home for at least 72 hours. No such instructions are given to people with flu – though the hope is they are responsible enough to stay home or at least mask up after almost three years of the pandemic-heightened vigilance. If no additional preventive measures are needed whether catching flu or COVID-19, do we need to continue testing every sick individual? From a scientific point of view, early diagnostic and detection are indispensable for monitoring any emerging novel variants and early signs of outbreaks, so that additional preventive measures can be implemented quickly. Related: Commentary: New COVID-19 variants have arrived. How worried should you be? Commentary: COVID-19 booster shots need to be updated to take on newer variants Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 will continue to circulate and evolve, and new variants will emerge. Currently, the flu and COVID-19 vaccines can be taken at the same visit. A combined COVID-flu vaccine could be ideal – something Pfizer and BioNTech have started studying but will need further trials to address questions about safety, side effects and effectiveness. Ultimately, taking a yearly flu shot is a very good idea to protect ourselves and prevent severe illness, in addition to the good habits we’ve developed like washing our hands, wearing masks or staying home when unwell.

SINGAPORE — Health experts have warned of a possible “tripledemic” where three major respiratory viruses could collide and sicken children at the same time, namely the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and the ones causing influenza and Covid-19. iStock The respiratory syncytial virus can cause severe or life-threatening infection in infants under the age of one and those born prematurely or have weakened immune systems. The Ministry of Health’s weekly bulletin showed that the incidence of acute respiratory infections among people at polyclinics across all ages was high in September and October At NUH, children infected with RSV, influenza, and rhinovirus or enterovirus account for about 80 to 90 per cent more cases than adults with the same conditions This includes some who had co-infections with other viruses Experts said this could potentially be due to the “immunity debt” children have, making them more susceptible to previously common infections By Nabilah Awang By Nabilah Awang Published December 6, 2022 Updated December 8, 2022 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — Health experts have warned of a possible “tripledemic” where three major respiratory viruses could collide and sicken children at the same time, namely the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and the ones causing influenza and Covid-19. And with increasing travel and the relaxation of safety and hygiene measures in the community, these three highly infectious viruses are taking a toll here, even though infection numbers seem to be trending down since last month, they added. The Ministry of Health’s weekly bulletin showed that the incidence of acute respiratory infections among people across all ages at polyclinics was high in September and October, with the highest number of infections standing at 3,514 in the second week of October. This was triple the number of acute respiratory infections recorded in the same week last year, which was 1,168. Dr Jyoti Somani, a senior consultant at the infectious diseases division of the National University Hospital (NUH), said that influenza is known to cause severe disease, especially in older people, but so far this year, there have been no “very severe” cases among seniors at the hospital. However, at the other end of the age spectrum, it is a different story. There are significantly more cases of RSV, influenza, and rhinovirus or enterovirus — about 80 to 90 per cent — in children aged under 18 than in adults within NUH now. Rhinovirus and enterovirus are viruses behind the common cold. This high proportion of younger patients includes some with co-infections of other viruses such as metapneumovirus, another common virus that causes an upper respiratory infection. Experts said that this could potentially be due to the “immunity debt” children have as a result of Covid-19 restrictions, making them more susceptible to previously common infections now. TODAY looks at how this tripledemic is infecting the young ones and whether immunity debt may be a big contributor. HOW IS THE TRIPLEDEMIC INFECTING CHILDREN? Experts said that the three highly contagious respiratory viruses cause similar symptoms such as fever, cough, runny nose and sore throat, and it is possible for a person to be infected with multiple viruses at the same time. Dr Rie Aoyama, a paediatric infectious diseases associate consultant at NUH’s Khoo Teck Puat – National University Children's Medical Institute, said that RSV can also cause severe or life-threatening infection in infants under the age of one and those born prematurely, those with underlying heart or lung conditions, or those with weakened immune systems. “These children are more likely to be hospitalised and require oxygen and mechanical support to help them breathe,” she added. “ These children are more likely to be hospitalised and require oxygen and mechanical support to help them breathe. Dr Rie Aoyama on infants who have weakened immunity and are infected by the respiratory syncytial virus ” In Singapore, RSV occurs regularly throughout the year with the main peak in June or July coinciding with the southern hemisphere winter season, and a smaller peak at the end of the year coinciding with the northern hemisphere winter season, Dr Aoyama said. The peak activity of RSV and influenza can occur together, putting children at risk of being infected with both viruses. "We are currently entering the northern hemisphere winter season, and with increasing travel, the increase of all three viruses is seen in many countries throughout the world,” Dr Aoyama added, referring to Covid-19 as the third of the three. Dr Somani noted that some paediatric patients in NUH are admitted for infections of multiple respiratory viruses, such as Covid-19 and influenza, or co-infections with other viruses such as the rhinovirus. And this may be a concern to many parents. In June, Singapore recorded the first paediatric Covid-19 death in an 18-month-old boy who had Covid-19, RSV and enterovirus infections. WHAT IS IMMUNITY DEBT? Though it is a matter of concern, the return of respiratory viruses is not surprising to healthcare experts, mostly due to the “immunity debt” children have. Many experts have hypothesised about the impact on infection rates after the Covid-19 pandemic when people wore masks and engaged in social distancing. The theory goes that Covid-19 measures also protected people from being infected by a range of viruses. A lack of regular exposure to these other viruses have led to people's immune systems becoming less effective at fighting them. That is why more people than usual would be catching certain diseases for the first time now since restrictions have been largely lifted. This theory, though, is still being debated. Dr Paul Tambyah, president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, said: “The concept of ‘immunity debt’ is right now just a hypothesis. "As we and others have shown, in Singapore, apart from the ‘circuit breaker’ (partial lockdown) period of April to May 2020, respiratory viruses never actually disappeared, with the notable exception of influenza.” Dr Somani said that influenza was almost absent from May 2020 to December 2021, and Singapore started to see flu cases again only in February this year. Experts have linked this absence to the broken chain of transmission caused by the near-complete shutdown of global travel. They also said that the absence of such viruses has caused young children born during the pandemic to have much less exposure to common respiratory viruses than children of the same age in previous years. Dr Aoyama said: “Having one viral infection may lower the child’s immunity such that they are more vulnerable to another co-existing or subsequent viral infection, or occasionally, bacterial pneumonia.” Similarly, Dr Matthias Maiwald, head consultant of microbiology service at KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH), said that because children had not been much exposed to RSV since 2020, this virus may now infect slightly older children than was the case before the pandemic. “The lack of exposure to viruses and bacteria during the pandemic has left people, in particular young children, more susceptible. “With the easing of safe management measures and resumption of travel, the return of respiratory viruses is expected — meaning that many of us will again have flu-like illnesses off and on. This is also reflected among the patients that our hospital is seeing, although it is difficult to put a percentage figure on this,” he said. HOW CAN WE PROTECT THE YOUNG ONES? Experts said that it is too early to tell if Singapore has crossed the peak of this tripledemic because a lot will depend on the activity in temperate countries and the people returning to Singapore from holidays there. Dr Tambyah said: “Those peaks can be any time from November to February, so we may have another peak in January or February, perhaps with the Chinese New Year (festivities). "For Sars-CoV-2, we have passed the current peak and I think it will be some time before the next one, so I do not think that we will have another coincidence of peaks for the three viruses this season." This refers to the virus behind Covid-19. In the meantime, adults around young children should practise good hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette, the experts advised. Dr Aoyama said that anyone who is unwell and showing symptoms should stay at home as much as possible, wear a mask and avoid social gatherings. “With increasing travel and the removal of restrictions for large crowds and gatherings, being socially responsible is really important to protect those around us from being unwell with these common viral infections.” She added that the flu jab is strongly recommended for children above the age of six months and is included in the national childhood immunisation schedule. Dr Li Jiahui, head of the infectious disease service at KKH, said that parents are advised to take their child to a general practitioner, paediatrician or to a hospital emergency department if infections look to become more serious.

Influenza numbers are up and there are a number of respiratory viruses going around in BC. Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are the primary culprits. For two years influenza numbers were low because of social distancing protocols and COVID-19 separating friends and family. Because of this, BC’s Ministry of Health says that it is especially important to get children vaccinated against influenza now. Severe illness and complications from influenza viruses are especially high in children under the age of 5-years-old and in people with underlying medical conditions like asthma and heart disease, pregnant women and people over the age of 65-years old. “As we head into the holiday season, I strongly encourage families and caregivers to get their children vaccinated against influenza, especially if they’re planning to spend time with elderly loved ones,” said Dr. Bonnie Henry, Provincial Health Officer. “I know families are busy, especially at this time of year, but it is important to make this part of your plans. To help, we are making it even easier to get your child immunized in the coming days. This helps ensure everyone can stay healthy and enjoy the festivities.” Vancouver’s BC Children’s Hospital announced a ‘code orange’ over the weeknd because of the influx of influenza-related deaths and admittances. A code orange refers to “mass casualty or disaster” according to health authorities. The code orange was canceled approximately 30 minutes after it was activated and the Provincial Health Services Authority has provided no further detail on the code being activated. The province said that to avoid these deaths and hospitalizations, vaccination is the best strategy. BC offers free influenza vaccination and it is encouraged for those six months and older. Children older than 2-years-old can opt to get a nasal spray vaccine instead of a shot and children 9-years-old and over need two doses. “Since it began in October, we have had a very enthusiastic response to the influenza campaign,” said Dr. Penny Ballem, executive lead for B.C.’s vaccine operations program. “At health authority clinics, community pharmacies and health-care provider offices, we’ve vaccinated over 1.5 million people, but the uptake has been low for children. “We would like to invite all parents and caregivers of children who have not received the influenza vaccine to register their kids in the Get Vaccinated system and book an appointment.” It’s now easier to get vaccinated as a family! Public health clinics now allow up to two immediate family members to be immunized when attending the appointment of a child, pending clinic capacity.

The province says that there is an ample supply of vaccines in supply and those wishing to get a shot can also get a COVID-19 booster at the same time, depending on where they go. “I am encouraged to see that this year is a record year of influenza vaccination in B.C. among older people thus far,” Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “This is particularly important as people plan indoor celebrations for the holiday season with friends and family of all ages, some of whom are at risk of serious effects from flu. However, we need to see a higher vaccination rate among young people.” “Therefore, I ask everyone to do their part and get themselves and their kids vaccinated to help protect them and their loved ones, as well as our health-care system. I also want to thank our health-care professionals, primary care providers and public-health immunization teams for their continued dedication in caring for British Columbians during this respiratory season.” BC says that in addition to getting vaccinated, parents and guardians should keep their children home when they are sick and encourage them to wear masks if they have mild symptoms. Proper hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette can also prevent the spread of influenza. Curtis BlandyCurtis Blandy has worked with Victoria Buzz since September 2022.
