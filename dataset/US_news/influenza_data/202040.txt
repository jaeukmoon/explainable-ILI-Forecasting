Coping strategies that can help / 10 Flu Myths October 1, 2020 Dispelling misinformation about the flu vaccine, sickness, treatment, and recovery If you've ever had the flu, you know how sick you can be. Chances are good that some of the advice friends and family gave you about avoiding or dealing with the flu was wrong. There seems to be no shortage of misinformation and bad advice when it comes to dealing with the flu and the flu shot. Here are 10 common myths about the flu. MYTH: You can catch the flu from the vaccine. The flu shot is made from an inactivated virus that can't transmit infection. So, people who get sick after receiving a flu vaccination were going to get sick anyway. It takes a week or two to get protection from the vaccine. But people assume that because they got sick after getting the vaccine, the flu shot caused their illness. MYTH: Healthy people don't need to be vaccinated. While it's especially important for people who have a chronic illness to get the flu shot, anyone — even healthy folks — can benefit from being vaccinated. Current CDC guidelines recommend yearly vaccination against influenza for everyone older than 6 months of age, including pregnant women. MYTH: Getting the flu vaccination is all you need to do to protect yourself from the flu. There are a number of steps you can take to protect yourself during flu season besides vaccination. Avoid contact with people who have the flu, wash your hands frequently, and consider taking anti-viral medications if you were exposed to the flu before being vaccinated. MYTH: The flu is just a bad cold. Influenza may cause bad cold symptoms, like sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, hoarseness, and cough. But according to CDC, the 2019-20 flu season led to at least 18 million medical visits, 24,000 deaths and 410,000 hospitalizations. The cumulative hospitalization rate for children ages four and under this flu season was 95.1 per 100,000 people as of the week ending on April 25, 2020. Experts attribute the high number of pediatric deaths to a "double barrel" flu season where both influenza A and B were dominant. It's not too late to get a flu shot. Even if it doesn't prevent you from getting the flu, it can decrease the chance of severe symptoms. MYTH: You can't spread the flu if you're feeling well. Actually, 20% to 30% of people carrying the influenza virus have no symptoms. MYTH: You don't need to get a flu shot every year. The influenza virus changes (mutates) each year. So, getting vaccinated each year is important to make sure you have immunity to the strains most likely to cause an outbreak. MYTH: You can catch the flu from going out in cold weather without a coat, with wet hair or by sitting near a drafty window. The only way to catch the flu is by being exposed to the influenza virus. Flu season coincides with the cold weather. So, people often associate the flu with a cold, drafty environment. But they are not related. MYTH: Feed a cold, starve a fever. If you have the flu (or a cold) and a fever, you need more fluids. There's little reason to increase or decrease how much you eat. Though you may have no appetite, "starving" yourself will accomplish little. And poor nutrition will not help you get better. MYTH: Chicken soup will speed your recovery from the flu. Hot liquids can soothe a sore throat and provide much needed fluids. But chicken soup has no other specific qualities that can help fight the flu. MYTH: If you have a high fever with the flu that lasts more than a day or two, antibiotics may be necessary. Antibiotics work well against bacteria, but they aren't effective for a viral infection like the flu. Then again, some people develop a bacterial infection as a complication of the flu, so it may be a good idea to get checked out if your symptoms drag on or worsen. The flu is a good example of how medical myths can get in the way of good medical care. When it's flu season, take the necessary steps to stay healthy. That includes separating fact from myth.

Saving Lives, Protecting People Search Submit Influenza (Flu) CDC 2020-2021 Flu Vaccine Campaign Kickoff EspaÃ±ol | Other Languages Print Minus Related Pages Thursday, October 1, 2020— Today, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID), along with other public health and medical groups, kicked-off the 2020-2021 flu vaccination season, emphasizing the added importance of vaccination this season during a virtual press conference. Participants, including director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health Dr. Anthony Fauci, urged the public and health care professionals to follow the CDC recommendation that everyone 6 months and older get vaccinated against flu annually Roll Your #SleeveUp to Fight Flu! Encourage your followers on social media to roll up their sleeves for an annual flu vaccine by featuring photos of yourself and others in your community getting a flu vaccine or showing off a bandage after getting a flu vaccine. #SleeveUp CDC also released multiple reports on the 2019-2020 flu season today, including influenza vaccination coverage estimates among the U.S. public, health care providers and pregnant women. The agency also released updated preliminary estimates on the burden of flu last season, and for the first time, estimates for the burden of flu averted by vaccination last season. During 2019-2020, CDC estimates there were 38 million flu illnesses, 18 million flu-associated medical visits, 400,000 flu hospitalizations and 22,000 flu-associated deaths. These numbers are lower than the in-season burden estimates provided last season, because they were calculated using more recently available data on flu testing practices in patients hospitalized with flu, which is a key input in the model CDC uses to generate these estimates. Influenza testing has increased in recent years, which can cause preliminary burden estimates to change. An example is the preliminary burden estimates made for the 2017-2018 season, when an initial estimate of 79,000 deaths, was later updated to 61,000. The CDC website has more information on how CDC estimates flu burden. CDC also provided new estimates on the burden of flu averted by vaccination last season. CDC estimates that flu vaccination prevented 7.5 million flu illnesses, 3.7 million flu medical visits, 105,000 flu hospitalizations and 6,300 flu deaths. These estimates are based on vaccine effectiveness estimates from 2019-2020, as well as data on vaccine coverage during last flu season which were also released by CDC today. CDC’s influenza vaccination coverage reports show that overall flu vaccination coverage (among people 6 months and older) during 2019-2020 increased from the previous season to nearly 52%. This is the highest flu vaccine coverage for this age group recorded since CDC recommended universal influenza vaccination of all persons 6 months and older in 2010. However, this figure also means that nearly half of U.S. residents did not get vaccinated. While flu vaccination increased overall for both children and adults, coverage did not increase among certain racial and ethnic groups. Black children have lower flu vaccination coverage than children of all other racial/ethnic groups. Hispanic adults and black adults continue to have lower flu vaccination coverage than white adults. Additionally, only 44% of people with chronic conditions were vaccinated against flu last season. And while flu vaccination coverage among pregnant women increased from 54% to 61% that still leaves a significant number of pregnant women and their babies unprotected from flu. Pregnant women and people with certain chronic conditions are among those at higher risk for flu complications, so it is especially important for them to be vaccinated against flu annually. Lastly, CDC’s flu vaccination coverage estimates for health care workers show that 81% were vaccinated against flu last season. Coverage was highest among physicians (98%) and lowest among aides and assistants (72%). CDC has emphasized the added importance of getting a flu vaccine during the 2020-2021 flu season because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While it is unclear how the pandemic will affect the flu season, CDC is preparing for COVID-19 and seasonal flu to spread at the same time. Co-circulation could place a tremendous burden on our health care system and result in many illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths. Getting a flu vaccine is something easy people can do to protect themselves and their loved ones and to help reduce the spread of flu this fall and winter. Flu vaccine will not protect against COVID-19. But vaccination has many other benefits and is part of a comprehensive public health strategy to reduce the burden of flu, which can flatten the curve of respiratory illnesses overall, help protect essential workers from flu, and preserve medical resources for care of patients with COVID-19. October is a good time to get vaccinated, but as long as flu viruses are circulating, vaccination can continue—even in January or later. The more people who are vaccinated against flu; the more people are protected from flu. Now More Than Ever CDC recommends everyone 6 months and older be vaccinated against flu. It protects the person getting vaccinated and the people around them. Flu vaccines have been shown to prevent flu illness and reduce the risk of hospitalizations and deaths. Flu vaccination is proven to help protect pregnant women and people with chronic health conditions while reducing the burden of flu on our communities and health care system. This year, especially, it will be most important to protect those at higher risk for flu complications. Many of these people are also at high risk for COVID-19 illness or serious outcomes. It is also important for caregivers and essential workers to protect themselves and those around them from flu by getting a flu vaccine. Vaccine and Administration Manufacturers estimate between 194 and 198 million doses of flu vaccine will be available this season. Approximately 99% of the flu vaccines will be quadrivalent. COVID-19 activity may affect when, where and how flu vaccines will be given. CDC has provided interim guidance for vaccination to help immunization providers ensure safe administration of vaccines during the pandemic. So far, nearly 90 million doses of flu vaccine have been distributed in the United States.

Past pandemics have likewise been accompanied by conspiracy theories and waves of mistrust in science. In this Curiosities of Medical History feature, we look at some of the wildest theories to emerge during the flu pandemic of 1918.Share on PinterestImage credit: St. Louis Post-Dispatch file photo/Tribune News Service via Getty ImagesThe COVID-19 pandemic is not a first in world history. There have been many before it, including the infamous Black Death, which historians believe started in 1334, and which may have lasted for centuries.More recently, the world was turned upside down by the 1889 flu pandemic and the 1918 flu pandemic, sometimes referred to as the “Spanish flu.”The latter resulted from infection with an H1N1 virus that had a genetic structure reminiscent of viruses of avian origin, though its actual source remains unknown.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the 1918 pandemic, which started to peter out the following year, caused around 40 million deaths globally.As the flu started spreading throughout the world, local governments and newspapers struggled to keep up with the devastation. On October 6, 1918, a Greek newspaper reported an announcement from the government, warning that:“The disease germs enter the body through the mouth and generally from the respiratory system. […] The disease spreads by coughs and [is] transmitted by air. Therefore, it is recommended the avoidance of [mental] stress and overwork. […] All schools must be close[d], and meticulous maintenance of cleanliness of lingerie and hands is proposed. In particular, it is highly recommended to avoid close contact with every person who displays flu symptoms.”This notice echoes those issued by governments today, and much of the public health advice was similar to present-day guidance; washing the hands frequently and wearing face masks were top criteria for public safety.And in 1918, much like now, dangerous misconceptions and conspiracy theories regarding the origin of the virus soon emerged. In this feature, we look at some of the most striking “fake news” from 1918 and explore why conspiracy theories were popular then and remain a widespread issue, despite having harmful effects.Article highlights:The controversy around aspirinToday, the Big Pharma conspiracy theory holds that in order to promote and sell pharmaceutical products, companies intentionally spread disease. This conspiracy theory has resurfaced in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, though it is hardly a 21st-century phenomenon.During the pandemic of 1918, one myth propagated in the United States and the United Kingdom was that the pandemic was linked to the use of aspirin produced by the German pharmaceutical company Bayer.The mistrust of products of German origin is not as strange as it may seem, given that the start of the pandemic coincided with the end of World War I, in which the U.S. and Germany had fought as enemies.The myth caused enough of a stir to prompt the American branch of Bayer to reassure potential buyers in the U.S. One advert, published on October 18, 1918, stated that “The manufacture of Bayer-Tablets and Capsules of Aspirin is completely under American control.”Ironically, some later studies have suggested that aspirin may indeed have worsened some symptoms of the flu responsible for the pandemic, but not due to tampering. A study paper published in Clinical Infectious Diseases in 2009 suggests that aspirin may have worsened the symptoms of the illness because doctors were prescribing dosages that were too high.The paper’s author, Dr. Karen Starko, notes that at the time, doctors were routinely prescribing dosages of 8.0–31.2 grams of aspirin per day, unaware that this can cause hyperventilation and pulmonary edema in some people.“Just before the 1918 death spike, aspirin was recommended in regimens now known to be potentially toxic and to cause pulmonary edema and may therefore have contributed to overall pandemic mortality and several of its mysteries,” Dr. Starko writes.Claims of biological warfareDuring the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, one widespread rumor claims that SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the disease, was created in a laboratory and nefariously spread throughout the world.The most prominent of these rumors holds that the virus was created in and leaked from a lab in China — though research indicates that SARS-CoV-2 is, in fact, of natural origin.This is not a far cry from myths and spurious claims about the origin of the influenza virus that emerged and spread in 1918.One such rumor, found in the pages of a Brazilian newspaper, suggested that the influenza virus was spread around the world by German submarines.Similar stories claimed that German boats coming ashore on the East Coast of the U.S. had released the infectious agent into the atmosphere.According to an account in Gina Kolata’s book Flu: The Story of the Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918 and the Search for the Virus that Caused It, a woman claimed to have seen a toxic cloud spreading over Boston as a camouflaged German ship drew close to the harbor.Kolata writes:“The plague came in on a camouflaged German ship that had crept into Boston Harbor under cover of darkness and released the germs that seeded the city. […] There was an eyewitness, an old woman who said she saw a greasy-looking cloud that floated over the harbor and wafted over the docks.”Kolata goes on to describe other rumors that Germans had snuck into the city carrying vials of germs and proceeded to release them in theaters and at rallies.A perpetually ‘foreign’ plagueWhen the COVID-19 pandemic started, some referred to SARS-CoV-2 as the “China” or “Wuhan” virus. This naming has racist and xenophobic connotations, suggesting that a specific country or population is responsible for the emergence and spread of a pathogen.The misnomers soon attracted an international outcry, with human rights advocates citing related surges in racism throughout the world.However, the phenomenon of naming a pandemic or epidemic after a specific country is by no means new. The 1918 flu is often called “the Spanish flu,” though it did not originate in Spain. In fact, its origins are still unclear. So how did it get this name?According to a research paper published in Clinical Infectious Diseases in 2008, the name “probably [emerged] because of the misinformation surrounding the news about the origin of the epidemic.” The authors go on to explain:“It is usually accepted that, because Spain was a neutral country in World War I, freedom of the press in Spain was greater than that in the allied countries and in Germany. The U.S. and European press, likely for political reasons, did not acknowledge or transmit timely and accurate news about the high number of casualties among their military and civilian population that were attributable to the ongoing influenza epidemic.”While “the Spanish flu” remains the best-known moniker for the cause of the 1918 pandemic, the illness took on other names, depending on the country.In Spain, it was sometimes referred to as “the French flu,” possibly because Spanish seasonal workers traveled to and from France by train, prompting Spanish authorities to believe that they had “imported” the virus from France.Another name for the flu in Spain was “the Naples Soldier,” referring to a musical performance popular at the time, suggesting that the virus stuck as easily as the melody.In Brazil, meanwhile, it was “the German flu,” in Poland it was “the Bolshevik disease,” and in Senegal it was “the Brazilian flu.” In short, each country nicknamed the virus after a political opponent.Why did these misconceptions catch on?In the past, as now, myths and conspiracy theories surrounding the origins of disease spread like wildfire.As the authors of a 2017 study in Current Directions in Psychological Science observe, conspiracy theories give people quick, easily acceptable explanations for issues that otherwise have no simple answers or solutions.The researchers found that people who believe in conspiracy theories do so for three reasons:epistemic motives — the need for ready-made causal explanations of certain problems or phenomena in order to regain a sense of certaintyexistential motives — the need to regain control over one’s situation or environmentsocial motives — “the desire to belong and to maintain a positive image” of oneself and the society that one inhabits or wishes to inhabitOur senses of certainty, control, and belonging can easily become jeopardized in crisis situations, such as a pandemic.Both the influenza virus behind the 1918 pandemic and the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19 have maintained an aura of mystery: Scientists and governments do not and did not provide quick, easy solutions for stopping the spread.The means available to prevent infection — wearing face masks in public, minimizing social contact — feel precarious and often alienating, sometimes seriously harming mental health and altering daily life.Naturally, widespread anxiety in times of crisis prompts people to look for answers and solutions everywhere — and conspiracy theories seem to provide them.Yet, time and time again, experts have shown that buying into conspiracy theories does more harm than good, damaging public health and social well-being.Past public health crises such as the 1918 pandemic can teach us important lessons about crisis management — as long as we learn from our mistakes.

Download PDF Download PDF Credit: Kiyoshi Takahase Segundo / Alamy Stock PhotoThe 2009 influenza pandemic prompted the fastest global vaccine development effort in history. But it wasn’t fast enough.By the time vaccine companies had designed, tested and distributed hundreds of millions of doses of licensed vaccines — a process that, using the best technologies available, took about 6 months — the pandemic wave had already swept across the world.Wanting to speed up the development clock, scientists at Novartis teamed up with collaborators at the J. Craig Venter Institute and Synthetic Genomics and, using synthetic biology techniques, devised a way of turning genetic sequence data from a novel virus into a vaccine candidate in a matter of days.Instead of using killed or weakened viruses, as most vaccine developers had done in the past, the Novartis-led team planned to deliver carefully designed RNA segments, which would instruct cells in the body to create a protein that imitates part of the target virus and primes the immune system to attack if the real virus enters the cell.In 2011, the researchers beta-tested this novel vaccine platform in response to a mock influenza pandemic. That preparation then paid off richly when, 2 years later, in March 2013, Chinese health officials announced three cases of people infected with a novel strain of avian influenza.The same Novartis-led team jumped into action.The researchers downloaded the virus’s gene sequences from the internet. Within a week, they had chemically synthesized the genes encoding the vaccine antigens and created a fully synthetic RNA-based vaccine that was ready for preclinical testing. They also inserted the same gene sequences into a genomic backbone common to many flu viruses to fashion an inactivated-virus vaccine that entered human testing in August 2013.That vaccine candidate quickly proved safe and immunogenic. And by the end of the year, Novartis had already begun mass-manufacturing the vaccine, allowing the US government to amass a strategic reserve of the product.Fortunately, that strain of influenza did not become a global pandemic. But the speedy development, clinical testing and stockpiling of an effective synthetic vaccine against bird flu set the stage for current efforts to rapidly address the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease.The possibility of using synthetic genes for rapid vaccine development against emerging infections also became one of the main goals of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a global partnership established in 2016. Plus, synthetic genes paved the way for oncology-focused companies to generate cancer vaccines individualized to the specific DNA sequence of a patient’s tumour.Several such personalized cancer vaccines are now in clinical testing. More than a dozen gene-based vaccines are also in the works to fight COVID-19.Notably, the scientists behind all those experimental coronavirus vaccines have essentially followed the same playbook established by the Novartis-led researchers years earlier: they each started with genomic data from the mysterious new virus first reported in Wuhan, China, and — informed by 3D protein structures deciphered soon thereafter — worked at record-breaking speeds to make candidates available and ready for clinical testing.On 16 March 2020, just 66 days after the viral genome was released, clinicians administered the first dose of the first vaccine candidate in a first-in-human trial. Others soon followed.As the race for a COVID-19 vaccine intensifies, time is clearly on the side of synthetic biology. But will the approach ultimately prove safe and effective? Only time will tell.Further readingWrapp, D. et al. Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation. Science 367, 1260–1263 (2020).Corbett, K. S. et al.

People can be infected with both COVID-19 and influenza viruses at the same time and could suffer even worse health outcomes than one infection alone. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends everyone ages 6 months and older get a flu vaccine every year to protect against the most common types of influenza viruses.By getting vaccinated against seasonal flu, you reduce the likelihood that you will get the flu and transmit it to others. You also reduce the likelihood that you will need a trip to the doctor or emergency room, so you can continue to be safer at home. When large parts of the community get their flu shot, we reduce community transmission of the flu and hospitalizations due to the flu. This allows more healthcare resources to be available for treatment of other diseases such as COVID-19.The Pasadena Public Health Department is offering seasonal flu vaccines at no cost to anyone ages 6 months and older.John Muir High School (1905 Lincoln Ave) – Wednesday, October 28 and Thursday, October 29 from 9 am – 1 pmPasadena High School (2925 E. Sierra Madre Ave) – Wednesday, November 4 and Thursday, November 5 from 9 am – 4 pmFlu clinics are conducted with COVID-19 protocols in place, to safeguard your health.Vaccine supplies are limited, and will be given on a first come, first served basis. For individuals suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19, flu vaccinations should be postponed for 14 days after receiving results. If you are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, contact your healthcare provider and come to a different clinic when you are healthy.Please wear a short-sleeved shirt and a face covering.For more details about flu vaccine clinics, call City Service Center at (626) 744-7311.

The president contracted influenza while attending peace talks in Paris, but the nation was never told the full, true story Meilan Solly Senior Associate Digital Editor, History October 2, 2020 Woodrow Wilson, seen here at the start of the Paris Peace Conference in January 1919, never publicly acknowledged the pandemic's toll on his country. Photo by Hulton Archive / Getty Images The 1918 influenza pandemic killed an estimated 50 to 100 million people worldwide—including some 675,000 Americans—in just 15 months. But Woodrow Wilson’s White House largely ignored the global health crisis, focusing instead on the Great War enveloping Europe and offering “no leadership or guidance of any kind,” as historian John M. Barry, author of The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History, recently told Time’s Melissa August. “Wilson wanted the focus to remain on the war effort,” Barry explained. “Anything negative was viewed as hurting morale.” In private, the president acknowledged the threat posed by the virus, which struck a number of people in his inner circle, including his personal secretary, his oldest daughter and multiple Secret Service members. Even the White House sheep came down with the flu, reports Michael S. Rosenwald for the Washington Post. Wilson himself contracted the disease shortly after arriving in Paris in April 1919 for peace talks aimed at determining the direction of a post-World War I Europe. As White House doctor Cary T. Grayson wrote in a letter to a friend, the diagnosis arrived at a decidedly inopportune moment: “The president was suddenly taken violently sick with the influenza at a time when the whole of civilization seemed to be in the balance.” Grayson and the rest of Wilson’s staff downplayed the president’s illness, telling reporters that overwork and Paris’ “chilly and rainy weather” had sparked a cold and fever. On April 5, the Associated Press reported that Wilson was “not stricken with influenza.” Woodrow Wilson (far right) contracted the flu while attending peace talks in Paris in April 1919. Public domain via Wikipedia Commons Behind the scenes, the president was suffering the full force of the virus’ effects. Unable to sit up in bed, he experienced coughing fits, gastrointestinal symptoms and a 103-degree fever. Then, says biographer A. Scott Berg, the “generally predictable” Wilson started blurting out “unexpected orders”—on two separate occasions, he “created a scene over pieces of furniture that had suddenly disappeared,” despite the fact that nothing had been moved—and exhibiting other signs of severe disorientation. At one point, the president became convinced that he was surrounded by French spies. “[W]e could but surmise that something queer was happening in his mind,” Chief Usher Irwin Hoover later recalled. “One thing was certain: [H]e was never the same after this little spell of sickness.” How the 1918 Pandemic Hit Woodrow Wilson and His White House | Smithsonian Channel Watch on Wilson’s bout of influenza “weaken[ed] him physically … at the most crucial point of negotiations,” writes Barry in The Great Influenza. As Steve Coll explained for the New Yorker earlier this year, the president had originally argued that the Allies “should go easy” on Germany to facilitate the success of his pet project, the League of Nations. But French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau, whose country had endured much devastation during the four-year conflict, wanted to take a tougher stance; days after coming down with the flu, an exhausted Wilson conceded to the other world leaders’ demands, setting the stage for what Coll describes as “a settlement so harsh and onerous to Germans that it became a provocative cause of revived German nationalism … and, eventually, a rallying cause of Adolf Hitler.” Whether Wilson would have pushed harder for more equitable terms if he hadn’t come down with the flu is, of course, impossible to discern. According to Barry, the illness certainly drained his stamina and impeded his concentration, in addition to affecting “his mind in other, deeper ways.” Wilson's second wife, Edith, essentially served as commander-in-chief following her husband's debilitating October 1919 stroke. Public domain via Wikimedia Commons Despite his personal experience with the pandemic, the president never publicly acknowledged the disease wreaking havoc on the world. And though Wilson recovered from the virus, contemporaries and historians alike argue that he was never quite the same. Six months after he came down with the flu, Wilson suffered a debilitating stroke that left him paralyzed on his left side and partially blind. Instead of disclosing her husband’s stroke, First Lady Edith Wilson hid his life-threatening condition from politicians, the press and the public, embarking on a self-described “stewardship” that Howard Markel of “PBS Newshour” more accurately defines as a secret presidency. The first lady was able to assume such broad power due to a lack of constitutional clarity regarding the circumstances under which a president is considered incapacitated. A clearer protocol was only established with the ratification of the 25th Amendment in 1967. As Manuel Roig-Franzia wrote for the Washington Post in 2016, Edith’s “control of the flow of information did not go unnoticed by an increasingly skeptical Congress.” At one point, Senator Albert Fall even declared, “We have a petticoat government! Wilson is not acting! Mrs. Wilson is President!” Though Wilson’s condition improved marginally in the final years of his presidency, Edith continued, for all intents and purposes, to serve as the nation’s chief executive until her husband left office in March 1921. The weakened president died three years later, on February 3, 1924. Get the latest stories in your inbox every weekday.

Video Ad Feedback See how world leaders reacted to Trump's coronavirus diagnosis 01:24 - Source: CNN CNN — A century ago, a new respiratory virus gripped the country at the height of World War I. It started among American troops and exploded into a flu pandemic that killed 675,000 people in the US. Like the coronavirus, the fast-spreading 1918 fludisrupted life in unprecedented ways. It overwhelmed health care systems, cleared public spaces, and shuttered workplaces and social events. Like President Donald Trump, President Woodrow Wilson’s administration downplayed the pandemic. And like Trump, who announced early Friday that he has coronavirus, Wilson also got infected. So did some of their closest aides and staff members. “Wilson never made a public statement about the pandemic. Never,” said John M. Barry, author of “The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History.” “So to keep morale up during the war, the government lied,” Barry added, in an interview with CNN. “National public health leaders said things like, ‘This is ordinary influenza by another name.’ They tried to minimize it. As a result, more people died than would have otherwise.” Woodrow Wilson, who served as President from 1913 to 1921. Topical Press Agency/Hulton Archive/Getty Images Wilson already had one domestic crisis – a world war – to worry about, making the pandemic an afterthought. “He had an OCD personality and he focused intensely on the war, period,” Barry said. “Nothing distracted him.” But Howard Markel, a physician and medical historian at the University of Michigan, disagrees that Wilson downplayed the pandemic. The federal government was so small in that era, he said, it had a limited role in public health. At the time, there were no federal health agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the National Institutes of Health. The government’s role was limited to war, collecting taxes, and making federal law, Markel told CNN. Local governments played a key role in health issues. Wilson’s administration kept his illness a secret Trump’s Covid-19 diagnosis is an extraordinary development a month before a presidential election. He has dismissed experts’ guidance on wearing masks and holding socially distanced events even as the virus has killed more than 208,000 people nationwide. At age 74 and obese, he falls into a high-risk category for serious complications from the disease. Wilson was not exactly a picture of health when he got the flu at age 63. Before his illness, he’d suffered several health problems, including asthma and a stroke. He got the flu in 1919 while in Paris, where he spent several months negotiating the peace treaty after the war. Nurses care for victims of the 1918 flu epidemic outdoors canvas tents. Hulton Archive/Getty Images Wilson became ill and coughed so severely his doctor initially thought he’d been poisoned in an assassination attempt. He started having hallucinations that he was surrounded by spies. But his administration kept his illness a secret. There were no televisions and no social media back then so it did not take much effort. “He thought the French were spying on him. He also believed he was personally responsible for things like all the furniture (in his room),” Barry said. “If he weren’t President, deathly ill in the middle of the peace conference, it might have been funny.” After his recovery and return to the US, Wilson went on a national tour to drum up support for his peace treaty. He suffered a stroke later that year and died in 1924. The 1918 flu mostly killed young people While last century’s pandemic – it was often called the “Spanish flu,” even though it didn’t originate in Spain – had some similarities to the coronavirus, there were some differences. With the flu, people had horrific symptoms like bleeding from the nose, mouth, eyes and ears. The 1918 virus also mostly killed the young, which left researchers puzzled. The mortality rate was especially high in people between ages 20-40 and in children under 5. Nurses with stretchers for flu victims in 1918. Library of Congress “Roughly two-thirds of the deaths were age 18-50, and the peak age for death was 28,” Barry said. “Soldiers were, of course, in the age group that was the prime target. The US military training camps obviously had high mortality.” Fear swept over the nation as people started turning on one another. “Because they could not trust what they were being told, real terror gripped some people, so much so that society itself began to fray and it became everyone for himself,” Barry added. “That’s different from most disasters, when people come together to help each other.” Masks were an issue then, too This will sound familiar. In 1918, public health authorities strongly recommended that people wear face masks to stop the spread of the virus. They also issued social distancing guidelines and urged people to practice proper hygiene. But back then, Americans who did not wear masks were not making a political statement. Like with the coronavirus, protesters advocated for the use of masks. This photo was taken in Paris in March 1919. Topical Press Agency/Getty Images “Lots of people grumbled about wearing masks, or even refused to do so, but they weren’t doing so because of a political stance or partisan allegiance,” said Alexander Navarro, assistant director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan. With the country at war, wearing masks was seen as patriotic. People who didn’t wear them were shamed in public service announcements and news headlines for their defiance. “Lots of elected officials as well as public health officers were telling people to wear masks as part of their civic duty,” Navarro told CNN. “They were trying to tap into this idea that if you couldn’t be over there fighting alongside our boys overseas, you could be doing your part here on the home front.” The flu faded in 1920 after killing more than 50 million people worldwide. There has been no flu as lethal before or since. CNN’s Francesca Giuliani-Hoffman contributed to this report.

So what if we get both illnesses at the same time?https://p.dw.com/p/3jD0AImage: picture-alliance/dpa/A. GebertAdvertisementJust as scientists are scoring successes in coronavirus research, new problems are on their way. Fall is with us and winter is around the corner, so the season for colds and flu has begun — joining COVID-19. The coronavirus is already new territory for science, and the effects of its combination with influenza are equally unknown. There is much speculation about what is to be expected and what will or could happen when these two dangerous infectious diseases come together. This is what is making it so difficult to prepare adequately for the cold time of year. Coughing, sniffles and hoarseness in fall and winter are nothing new, and flu is also a regular feature of these seasons. But we can be vaccinated against it, and that is of advantage in diagnosing cases of coronavirus as well. "If people who have been vaccinated against influenza still have flu symptoms, it is more likely that it is not influenza," says Gerárd Krause from the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research in the northern German city of Braunschweig. "This, in turn, makes it easier to decide matters regarding home quarantine and getting a clear diagnosis."Whether a flu vaccination can reduce the severity of COVID-19 is unclearImage: picture-alliance/dpa/V. Prokofyev Influenza vaccination A flu vaccination may thus be able to narrow down the diagnostic options when flu-like symptoms occur, but whether such a vaccination also has an influence on the behavior of the dangerous new virus is — like so much else — not clear. "It is conceivable that there is an indirect effect. But it is, I believe, a matter of speculation whether it has an immunological effect in the narrower sense,” says Krause. Every winter, doctors' waiting rooms are full of people who are coughing and sniffing but who mostly turn out to have only a severe respiratory infection. According to current knowledge, the virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, is also likely to be subject to seasonal fluctuations. In winter, cold viruses, at least, flourish because cold and dry air offers ideal conditions for their spread. In addition, it becomes more difficult to air rooms regularly and intensively — an important further measure to counteract the coronavirus and contain to some extent the danger posed by aerosols. The flu virus can be deadlyImage: Novartis VaccinesAccording to the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's public health agency, between 5% and 20% of people in Germany become infected with flu viruses every year. These viruses are also dangerous and can be fatal. The flu vaccination must be adapted to the influenza viruses every year, because they mutate. But at least there is a vaccination. Most experts agree that there is unlikely to be a vaccine against the coronavirus by the time the next wave of influenza comes around. And even if a vaccine were to be approved, many unknowns remain. COVID-19 and flu in double pack For example, there is a lack of practical experience in dealing simultaneously with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza. It is possible to speculate that having influenza could facilitate the entry of the coronavirus into the human body. "The general weakening of the immune system during an influenza infection could increase the susceptibility of a patient to a SARS-CoV-2 infection," Krause says. However, it is uncertain how dangerous this double infection could ultimately be and what can be done about it. Krause is of the opinion that we must arm ourselves against all three diseases — colds, flu and COVID-19. If we have a cold, bed rest, hot tea and cough medicine usually help. We can get vaccinated against flu. But how do we deal with COVID-19? A cold can be unpleasant, but is not life-threateningImage: picture-alliance/dpa/C. Klose Probably people can only hope that if they get the illness, they will have a mild form with as few after-effects as possible. Here, it will certainly help to stick to suggested rules on hygiene to reduce or prevent our exposure to the virus. In an interview with DW, Bonn-based virology professor Hendrik Streeck made it clear that COVID-19 usually takes a more severe course when there is a high viral load at infection. Hygiene, hygiene, hygiene The same hygiene measures with which we are trying to get at least some kind of grip on COVID-19 also apply to influenza. The less we come into contact with viruses, the greater the chance that we will be spared an infection or that it will be mild. Image: picture alliance/dpa/C. KloseThese measures include general hygiene precautions such as frequent hand washing and the wearing of protective face masks. "The various hygienic measures against COVID-19 will also reduce the spread of influenza," says Krause. "Possibly, further connections of a more immunological nature will be discovered." Let us hope that is the case, because the flu season hasn't even started.

We should do everything we can to prevent the flu, and getting a flu shot is the best way to do that. Getting a flu shot also helps protect family members who are at risk of respiratory disease.It is likely that flu viruses will spread this fall and winter. Healthcare systems could be overwhelmed treating patients with flu and COVID-19.There are many important benefits, such as:Flu vaccines have been shown to reduce the risk of flu illness, hospitalization, and death.Getting a flu vaccine can also save healthcare resources for the care of patients with COVID-19.Flu vaccine prevents millions of illnesses and flu-related doctor’s visits each year. For example, during 2018-2019, flu vaccination prevented an estimated 4.4 million influenza illnesses, 2.3 million influenza-associated medical visits, 58,000 influenza-associated hospitalizations, and 3,500 influenza-associated deaths.During seasons when the flu vaccine viruses are similar to circulating flu viruses, flu vaccine has been shown to reduce the risk of having to go to the doctor with flu by 40 percent to 60 percent.Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people around you, including those who are more vulnerable to serious flu illness, like infants and young children, elderly, and people with certain chronic health conditions.Despite the many benefits offered by flu vaccination, only about half of Americans get an annual flu vaccine and flu continues to cause millions of illnesses, hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations and tens of thousands of deaths. Many more people could be protected from flu if more people got vaccinated.Be Active. Be Well.

MTFs will soon be offering flu vaccinations to young children and adults 65 and older, and installation-sponsored community influenza vaccination events are currently scheduled to begin in early November, depending on where you are located, and vaccine availability. Specific event dates, times and locations will be announced on AFN, your MTF’s web and social media sites and through local installation communication channels. Once the vaccine is available, flu shots will also be offered at MTFs during regularly scheduled appointments. "The first and most important step in protecting against the flu is to get vaccinated,” said Col. Scott Mower, Regional Health Command Europe Force Health Protection Officer. “The second is to take everyday preventive actions to stop the spread of germs, like frequent hand-washing, avoiding contact with sick people, practicing good social distancing, and staying home if you are sick. The third step is, if you do think you might have the flu, contact your Medical Treatment Facility’s (MTF) COVID-19 hotline.” Because the symptoms of COVID-19 and the flu are quite similar, a health care provider may recommend testing and evaluation for one or both illnesses. Mower says that while receiving the flu vaccine will not protect you against COVID-19, it has been shown to reduce the risk of illness, hospitalization and death from influenza virus infections which cause the flu. “Getting a flu vaccination also helps prevent flu epidemics and decreases the burden on the health care system during the COVID-19 pandemic,” Mower added. "If you are not in an active duty military unit, the fastest way to get the vaccine is to go to a local community flu drive event where it is being offered." "Community flu events this year may be more time intensive and logistically challenging than in year’s past in order to protect participants from COVID-19,” said Mower. “We are asking for everyone’s patience up front and will do our upmost to minimize any inconveniences. Your safety and the safety of our staff is paramount.” While flu vaccinations are an annual requirement for Soldiers, everyone is urged to get one. The Army medical community in Europe offers the vaccine to not only Soldiers, but to their Family members, Retirees and Civilians as well. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, flu activity begins to increase in October, peaking between December and February and diminishing by May. Each year the effectiveness of the flu vaccine varies. And while it is still too early to predict how effective this season's flu vaccine will be in Europe, the vaccination is still recommended as it may make the illness milder and prevent hospitalization if the flu is contracted, according to Regional Health Command Europe officials. Mower said that according to a recent study, "Vaccination reduces the number of flu related deaths, the number of hospital intensive care unit admissions and the duration of hospital stay for patients who do get hospitalized." "The study also found that unvaccinated adults with the flu who were admitted to the hospital were two to five times more likely to die than someone who had been vaccinated. The more people who get vaccinated against the flu, the lower the chance of it spreading to those who have a higher risk for severe symptoms," added Mower. While influenza and COVID share some common symptoms, there are distinct differences. “COVID-19 and flu share some similar symptoms,” said Mower. “For example, viral infections cause both COVID-19 and the flu. However, COVID-19 is due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and flu is from influenza A and B viruses. The biggest difference is that symptoms of flu tend to occur faster and can have greater variation. But COVID-19 is more likely to lead to severe illness or death. While both viruses can spread via person to person contact, the flu spreads faster and is more likely to affect children.” According to public health officials, it’s possible to have COVID-19 yet be asymptomatic and not show any signs of being or feeling ill. Thus, the need to practice good hand hygiene and social distancing and use a face covering in public or when social distancing is not possible. “For both COVID-19 and the flu, it’s possible to spread the virus for up to two days before experiencing any symptoms,” Mower said. “And you may remain contagious for at least 10 days after signs or symptoms first appeared. When it comes to staying healthy and safe, one should always err on the side of caution.” Mower offered additional tips and advice to help protect yourself and others from flu and help stop the spread of germs. 1. Avoid close contact: Avoid close contact with people who are sick. When you are sick, keep your distance from others to protect them from getting sick too. 2. Stay home when you are sick: If possible, stay home from work, school, and errands when you are sick. This will help prevent spreading your illness to others. 3. Cover your mouth and nose: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing. It may prevent those around you from getting sick. Flu and other serious respiratory illnesses, like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), whooping cough, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), are spread by cough, sneezing, or unclean hands. "Maybe you've heard of 'sneeze in your sleeve' to remind you to cover your mouth and nose with the inside of your elbow, not your hand, when you sneeze or cough," Mower said. "That keeps the germs off of your hands." 4. Wash your hands: Washing your hands often will help protect you from germs. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub. 5. Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth: Germs are often spread when a person touches something that is contaminated with germs and then touches his or her eyes, nose, or mouth. 6. Practice other good health habits: Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces at home, work or school, especially when someone is ill. Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids, and eat nutritious food.

Close to a million people have died. National governments have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by introducing a series of measures to control its spread. These measures include stay-at-home orders (lockdown), school and business closures, and health service reconfiguration. The measures have had widespread secondary effects such as rises in unemployment, financial difficulties, social isolation, domestic violence, and difficulties accessing health services. There are concerns that these effects, together with consequences of the disease itself (eg, increases in mortality, fear of the disease) may have a profound impact on population mental health and suicide risk.1,2 However, few studies have investigated the impact on suicide of previous epidemics. There is a suggestion that suicides rose in the US during the 1918-1920 influenza pandemic3 and among older people in Hong Kong during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic.4 During the 1918-1920 influenza pandemic, Taiwan experienced 2 waves of infection during October-December 1918, when an estimated 770,000 people (22.4% of the population) were infected, and December 1919-March 1920 (148,000 cases; 4.3% of the population).5 In response, the Japanese Colonial Government implemented policies such as closing schools and theaters and prohibiting religious activities. People were advised to keep physically distant from individuals with influenza. The restaurant and transportation industries were severely affected. In view of current concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide, we investigated changes in suicide rates in Taiwan at the time of the 1918-1920 influenza pandemic. Methods We extracted monthly mortality data for suicide and pneumonia in Taiwan (1910-1920) from the annual Statistical Reports of Taiwan Governor-General Office. Digitalized images of these reports were available online (http:/csd.lib.ntu.edu.tw/). As there was no evidence for extra-Poisson variation, we used Poisson regression to estimate the suicide rate ratio (RR) for each month during and shortly after the pandemic (October 1918-December 1920), relative to that expected based on the pre-pandemic trend between January 1910 and September 1918, using log-transformed population as the offset. A similar approach has been used in previous studies examining the impact on suicide of global financial crisis6 and pesticide bans.7,8 Underlying linear trends were controlled for by including a month variable (ie, month 1 to month 132) in the model; seasonality was controlled for by including dummy variables for calendar month. Results On average, 585 people died of pneumonia per month in Taiwan in January 1910-September 1918 before the influenza pandemic. There was a marked increase in pneumonia deaths during the influenza pandemic, with 2 peaks: November 1918 (6,155 deaths; rate = 179.2 per 100,000 population) and January 1920 (7,429 deaths; 214.2 per 100,000) (Figure 1A). Monthly suicide deaths fluctuated between 1910-1920, with a median of 57.5 (range, 31-88) suicides and a rate of 1.69 (range, 0.95-2.76) per 100,000. Click figure to enlarge Suicide rates were no higher than expected during the first wave of infection (Figure 1B, Supplementary Table 1). During the second wave, there were increases in suicide of 33% (RR = 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-1.77) and 35% (RR = 1.35; 95% CI, 1.05-1.75) in the second (January 1920) and fourth (March 1920) months of this wave, corresponding to an excess 14 (95% CI, 0-25) and 19 (95% CI, 3-31) suicides, respectively. Discussion The 1918-1920 influenza pandemic was associated with a small and short-lived increase in suicide in Taiwan. The number of excess suicide deaths was substantially lower than the number of influenza deaths. This short-lived rise in suicide is consistent with that seen in the US in 1918-1920.3 A number of factors may have contributed to the increase in suicide deaths; these include fear related to the high transmission and fatality rates, and the fear may have been more intense in the second wave of infection due to people’s experience of the first wave. Other possible contributing factors include social isolation resulting from the epidemic control measures and the economic impact of the pandemic. Furthermore, it has been suggested that influenza infection and/or the associated immune response might directly increase vulnerability to mood disorders and suicide.9 While the socioeconomic and technological (eg, communication technology) environments in which the 1918-1920 influenza pandemic occurred were very different from those of the present day, the findings may nevertheless have implications for suicide prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic. The short-lived (and small) rise in suicide deaths in 1918-1920 is reassuring, but the socioeconomic consequences of the current pandemic may be more challenging, particularly if the pandemic is long lasting and requires longer-term control measures.1 Equally, impacts may be mitigated by the extent to which improvements in communication technology and online help available in many countries allow people to maintain social connectedness and receive health care while remaining physically distant.10-12 If the rise in suicide deaths seen in 1918-1920 was due to direct biological effects of the virus on the brain, these may too be a concern in the current COVID-19 pandemic as there is evidence of neuropsychiatric effects of coronavirus infection.13 Given the absence of clear evidence of the likely impact of the pandemic on population mental health and suicide risk, it is critical to closely monitor these outcomes and conduct timely research to ensure that policy makers make the best decisions to optimize population health.14 Published online: September 29, 2020.

Second, Dr Andrade should have warned readers that Bacloville’s results are most questionable, lacking robustness. Although he cited us,3 he overlooked the evidence we provided indicating that the Bacloville article4 was published without acknowledging major changes to the initial protocol, affecting the primary outcome. Coincidentally (although as skeptics, we do not believe in coincidence), the initial statistical team was changed when data were sold to the French pharmaceutical company applying for the marketing authorization in France. As Ronald H. Coase warned, “If you torture the data long enough, it will confess.” Related Articles × Close Table Of Contents × Close5-year-old’s tragic story inspires free flu shot clinicsSkip to main content HomeNewsSportsBusinessAutosLife + HomeEntertainmentOpinionObituariesWeatherAdvertiseScoreseNewspaperPuzzlesNewslettersPodcastsFor SubscribersCorrectionsContributor ContentCelebrate Michigan “This could have been prevented”: 5-year-old’s tragic story inspires free flu shot clinicsAshley Zlatopolsky | Special to The Detroit NewsIn 2003, Alana Yaksich died from influenza at the age of 5 just 48 hours after developing flu symptoms. One Saturday morning, the perfectly healthy girl with no underlying conditions woke up with a 99 degree fever and didn’t want to go to dance class. She felt better throughout the day and went to bed. In the middle of the night she woke up vomiting, her fever having skyrocketed to 106 degrees.“At first I thought the thermometer was broken,” Alana’s father Zachary Yaksich, who founded Alana’s Foundation in her memory, explains. The organization provides influenza education, support and free flu shot clinics for the community, which are being held this fall in indoor, outdoor and drive-thru locations around Metro Detroit. “So we got a second thermometer and it was still 106 (degrees).”An ambulance was called and Alana was rushed to the hospital. For “what felt like an eternity,” Yaksich continues, but was only a couple of hours, doctors weren’t able to bring his daughter’s fever down and she was admitted to the pediatric ICU. Then she went into convulsions, slipped into a coma and was put on life support.The next morning, Yaksich spoke to Alana’s treating physician, who explained that she had the flu. “I felt relieved,” Yaksich says, “and the doctor kept talking. He looked at me and said, ‘You’re not comprehending what I’m telling you.’ What he was telling me was that the flu had attacked her brain, that she was going to die and that there was nothing they were able to do for her.”Alana was kept alive until Monday, but there were no changes.“That’s how fast the flu actually took her life,” Yaksich says. “I realized that this was something that could have been prevented with something as simple as a shot.”While Alana hadn’t been vaccinated against influenza, because her pediatrician didn’t recommend it at the time, even though she had been vaccinated against other illnesses, Yaksich understood the importance of a flu shot and made it his mission to share that message with others. Alana’s Foundation was launched in 2009 and began by setting up flu shot clinics at Alana’s school, the family’s church and other local community events.“It was gaining some traction,” Yaksich, 53 of West Bloomfield Township, recalls. But what he saw was that families would pick and choose who would be vaccinated. “I started asking, ‘Why?’ And it was always that they didn’t have insurance or the money to afford it.” He knew affordability and accessibility would be key to the mission, so Alana’s Foundation became an official nonprofit with the ability to raise money to cover all flu immunization expenses for people who participate in their clinics.“I tell my story a lot because it’s real,” Yaksich explains, who often speaks at events and to medical providers. “You’re looking at somebody local in your community who is one of the statistics, and that holds a lot of weight.”This month, Alana’s Foundation will be hosting more than 10 flu shot clinics around Michigan, including Metro Detroit. They are developed in partnership with Michigan Community Visiting Nurse Association, or VNA, which administers the vaccines. To ensure additional safety measures for COVID-19, drive-thru clinics have been organized and participants can fill out consent forms online, which are then processed via iPads onsite. Social distancing and masks will be enforced at all locations.“Community partnerships are an absolute necessity in protecting our citizens,” said Dave DeBoer, deputy fire marshal of the West Bloomfield Fire Department, which were the first responders for Alana. The department is one of the locations hosting a drive-thru flu clinic this year. “This may very well be the most important flu season ever to get a flu shot.”“This partnership and Alana's story have allowed us to inspire participation and achieve our goal of offering the community an opportunity for immunization, also removing cost as a barrier to participation,” Debbie Binder, West Bloomfield Township clerk, adds. Participants who have insurance will have their insurance companies billed for flu vaccine costs, while those without insurance will receive shots free of charge.“It’s the best way to protect yourself and protect the community around you,” Yaksich says. He believes this year above all is the most crucial for flu vaccination to prevent overwhelming the capacity of health care systems who are also treating COVID-19.Dr. Deborah Charfoos, a practicing OBGYN in Farmington Hills and Clawson, says this is a top concern in the medical community as we head into fall and winter. “We're really worried that what's going to happen is that if people don’t get their flu vaccine, they will get sick and end up in the emergency room and in all of our doctors offices,” she says, “and it’s going to overrun the system if COVID-19 also resurges in the winter.”She calls it a potential “double attack” on the medical system that could impact supplies and other items needed to keep people healthy. With overlaps in some symptoms between COVID-19 and influenza as well, Dr. Charfoos also recommends paying attention to timing. The flu will come on suddenly, she says, within a matter of hours, while COVID-19 can be more insidious and take days to fully develop. She also recommends speaking to physicians or pediatricians with any concerns regarding the vaccine and cautions that the shot itself cannot cause the flu.“Most people get a killed virus,” Dr. Charfoos explains. “That’s the shot. The only time you’re getting any kind of live virus at all is if you do the nasal spray [flu mist], which most people don’t.” Feeling under the weather for a day or two after the flu shot is normal, she says, and a sign that your body is learning how to fight the virus. “It’s activating to make antibodies so that when you get exposed to the flu, you’re not going to get it.”Yaksich adds that while traditional methods such as handwashing, wearing masks and staying home when sick can all help prevent the spread of influenza, getting a flu vaccine is the best form of defense. “It doesn’t take that long,” he says, “and the benefits far outweigh the risks.”For a list of free Alana's Foundation flu clinics, visit AF clinics 2020.

Manchester schools had 24,000 pupils off, 9,000 fewer than last week; Oldham school absences had fallen from 9,400 to 4,000 in ten days; at Bolton 34 per cent were off compared with 50 per cent last week; at Leeds there were 16,000 absentees against 30,000 at the peak.Even where absenteeism had fallen, however, there were sometimes more deaths to report. In Manchester fifteen people – eight women and seven men – died last week, compared with twelve the previous week. At Durham, where the epidemic appeared to be waning, there were five deaths (three men and two women) in the past few days. Bolton had four deaths last week, making a total of nine.The epidemic also appears to be subsiding in the Royal Navy, an Admiralty spokesman said yesterday.

(dcr)Winter is coming: Whatâs next in COVID-19 testing | McKinsey Skip to main contentWinter is coming: What’s next in COVID-19 testingSeptember 30, 2020 | Article Daniel CramerÂ Paul Rutten Â Audrey StikkersThe upcoming flu season in the Northern Hemisphere is expected to increase demand for COVID-19 testing. Decision makers may ask: Will there be enough flexible testing capacity to respond to global demand and avoid second lockdowns? (PDF-643 KB) Sufficient testing capacity is widely recognized as critical to managing COVID-19 and minimizing further outbreaks, as noted by the World Health Organization. Testing enables the quick identification, management, and isolation of COVID-19 patients. As a result, many countries have prioritized COVID-19 testing in the last six months and have increased it by orders of magnitude.

Consider seeking advice of legal and other relevant certified/licensed experts prior to taking any specific steps. Yet stakeholders around the globe are now preparing for an even larger challenge. With the onset of the winter and accompanying 2020â21 flu season, the demand for COVID-19 testing might increase threefold over the testing that has been performed in the summer months of 2020 (Exhibit 1), whether we see a second wave of virus infection or not. 1 Countries still have time to prepare for this increase in demand. However, they will have to expend substantial effort and agility, with a large amount of flexibility, to prepare for all possible scenarios that might arise in the winter months. We identify two focus areas for countries and their governments to prepare their test capacity for the winter: Scaling up testing capacity Organizing for success The importance of sufficient test capacity As we discussed in âSafeguarding our lives and our livelihoods: The imperative of our time,â an effective COVID-19 strategy includes containing outbreaks, protecting high-risk groups, safeguarding vital parts of the economy, andâif requiredâproviding a sense of security and comfort. This strategy sounds simple, but is surprisingly complex to implement. Luckily, stakeholders can learn to handle all aspects from practices around the world (Exhibit 2). Containing outbreaks It is imperative to effectively and efficiently identify micro-outbreaks early. To do so requires a testing capacity and contact-tracing infrastructure that could be rapidly applied to a single region. Examples of success in testing/contact tracing include slaughterhouses in Germany,1Lindhout S, âMore than a thousand corona infections in the North Rhine-Westphalia slaughterhouse,â de Volkskrant, June 20, 2020, volkskrant.nl. a shopping mall in the Netherlands,2NOS News, âBijenkorf Amsterdam closed; corona test advised for visitors with complaints,â NOS, August 18, 2020, nos.nl. and a nightclub in South Korea.3Gunia A, âWhat South Koreaâs nightclub coronavirus outbreak can teach other countries as they reopen,â Time, May 12, 2020, time.com. When a large number of visitors, employees, or people in these particular communities contracted COVID-19, extensive testing of visitors and employees was used to isolate positive cases and thereby curb further infections. Would you like to learn more about our Healthcare Systems & Services Practice? Protecting high-risk groups Highly vulnerable groups and groups of people that are highly exposed to the virus require additional focus and support. Long-term care facilities or care homes could consider the regular testing of residents and staff, including those who are asymptomatic. In Denmark, additional and regular testing of nursing home personnel and residents proved highly successful in containing outbreaks of COVID-19.4âTest and infection detection,â Politi, 2020, politi.dk. Employing additional safety precautions for essential workers Essential workers have a valuable role in societyâfrom giving people access to food and healthcare to ensuring the economy can run. Regular and asymptomatic testing would provide an extra safety barrier for those workers. Examples include successful testing of public transport officials and supermarket personnel in parts of the United Kingdom and United States, and isolation of positive cases. Basing policy decisions on facts If an outbreak causes paralysis in society or the economy, sometimes testing large parts of the asymptomatic population can help to rebuild trust. Widespread testing also provides the data on which to base policy decisions. Examples include Chinaâs widespread testing in Wuhan and Luxembourgâs population-wide sampling. 2 One conclusion that arises from this comparison is that all testing goals require fast results and widespread availability to ramp up capacity quickly. Not surprisingly, these two requirements are possible only if testing capacity exceeds demand. Given that we expect to see a sharp increase in demand5See Exhibit 1. in winter, it is essential countries come up with a way to scale up capacity quickly and avoid having to restrict testing. The next challenge: Winter is coming In winter, demand for tests in the Northern Hemisphere is expected to increase drastically. Counterintuitively, COVID-19 incidence itself is not expected to be the main driver of the need for increased COVID testing. Rather, the most significant factor is the recurring increase of other respiratory diseases and influenza-like symptoms in the colder winter months. These illnesses historically have had much larger penetration in the population, even when compared with COVID-19 at its peak. The peak incidence of flu-like symptoms in a population is, on average, three times higher in the winter than in the spring (Exhibit 1).6This peak incidence is if countries test all symptomatic people at a given moment in time. Since COVID-19 and the flu present with similar symptoms, more suspected âsymptomatic casesâ will require a COVID-19 test. With increased concern about a second wave, we also see many people in Europe who wanted to get tested with lighter symptoms. Moreover, as people grow concerned about their flu-like symptoms, a non-positive test on COVID-19 might still require further polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testingâeither to reaffirm that it is not COVID-19 or to identify what virus is present. A key challenge in predicting the demand for testing lies in the fact that the peak of the annual influenza outbreak differs from year to year. This year, the public health restrictions countries apply to contain COVID-19 also may cause a significantly decreased spread of the flu. For example, Australia saw a six-fold decrease in flu from January until June, their winter months, when the tightest lockdown measures were in place, admittedly from a high base year.7Scott S and Edmonds C, âFlu deaths drop in Australia as coronavirus restrictions save hundreds of lives,â ABC News, July 22, 2020, abc.net.au In the peak flu year of 2017â18, flu-like symptoms were more than five times higher in the winter than in the spring.8See Exhibit 1. Simply put: in the upcoming flu season, it is not known when the peak will hit or how high it could go. Some Northern Hemisphere countries could be hit while they are still fighting to contain the first wave of COVID-19. Decision makers may want to consider a strategy to prepare for a wide variety of possible peaks that takes these factors into account. 1. Scaling-up testing capacity Over the past several months, laboratories and other players in the diagnostic chain have shown dedication and resilience to scale up their capacity. The increase in capacity, however, was mostly linear, including adding more machines, materials, or people. This scale up was frequently accomplished by working late hours or deprioritizing other diagnosticsâwhich are quick fixes, rather than sustainable solutions. As we discussed âUnderstanding and managing the hidden health crisis of COVID-19 in Europe,â health systems across Europe canceled or postponed tens of thousands of elective procedures and outpatient appointments in spring 2020. Countries are challenged to create exponential growth in testing capacity, while simultaneously refraining from putting unsustainable pressure on the regular diagnostics. We describe four opportunities below to meet this challenge: improvements in productivity, the use of sample pooling, the use of multiplexing, and the adoption of creative testing methods. Productivity improvements Various manufacturing industries operate at significantly higher Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) than medical labs. By distilling best practices from other industries, medical labs could improve productivity substantially and decrease workload for their people. Potential improvement areas include optimizing machine-run schedules with working hours, more careful planning to fully load sample plates (to avoid waste of materials), better ergonomics, and increasing machine utilization through further automation, in particular of pre-analytical work. Experience shows that even if productivity improvements are well known, realizing them requires capabilities that are uncommon in many labs. On top of that, medical labs currently involved in COVID-19 testing often have challenges finding the right professionals. Labs could consider changing culture and behaviors in their organizations while ensuring the additional COVID-19 demand does not interfere with (or is not hampered by) regular processes. These labs also are working on maintaining the highest quality, while under extreme pressure caused by the crisis. Sample pooling Sample pooling is the practice of combining samples from multiple patients in one tube and treating it as a single sample during the testing process (Exhibit 3). If the test turns out negative (no COVID-19), all patients are diagnosed negative. If the test is positive, all samples need to be retested individually (leading to additional use of supplies and machine capacity). The efficiency gain is therefore dependent on the positive test rate of the patients and the pooling batch size. 3 As an example, Germany currently has a positive test rate of less than 2 percent.9Roser M et al., âCoronavirus (COVID-19) Testing,â Our World in Data, 2020, ourworldindata.org. Using a pooling batch size of 7 or 8 would lead to almost four times the effectiveness of current capacity, with a small sacrifice in sensitivity (which experts note is not clinically significant). Pooling is considered to be one of the safest ways to increase testing capacity rapidly. To implement pooling successfully, stakeholders could consider focusing on a limited set of larger labs that are used to processing high volumes with automated capabilities and, ideally, with pooling experience. Multiplexing Multiplex testing allows one patient sample to be tested for multiple indications at the same time (for example, a combination influenza flu A and B virus, respiratory syncytial virus, COVID-19). Especially with the upcoming flu season, multiplexing could be important: it can take away the confusion of a COVID-19 or influenza diagnosis with one test and thus allow labs to process more tests in a given period. However, it does require machine capacity and specific assay. Innovative testing methods New tests could truly transform the diagnostic landscape. A variety of options exists that could be dramatically easier, faster, and cheaper to administer. The highly sensitive PCR test is seen worldwide as the gold standard. However, it is also relatively expensive and virtually all versions require a lab. Other tests with different characteristics are under development. A much cheaper test (perhaps slightly less sensitive but still preferably with very few false negatives) would provide widespread screening and catch asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic patients. A non-lab-driven test could make tests accessible in many more locations. In a clinical setting, the overall sensitivity and accuracy of PCR would still be preferred. This means that additional communication and stratified testing methods should be used for different populationsâwhich would introduce complexity. Opening economies could depend not only on the availability of testing, but also on quick results indicating whether a person is contagious or not. Public health testing and lower sensitivity could get equally good results if applied in very high frequency, as in daily testing. This kind of testing would require easily available, fast, and extremely inexpensive tests. It is worth noting, however, that in a clinical setting the overall sensitivity and accuracy of PCR would still be preferred. This preference means that additional communication and stratified testing methods should be used for different populations, although doing so introduces complexity. Such testing methods are rapidly being developed. These methods include the use of saliva instead of a respiratory swab, isothermal amplification instead of PCR (for example, in the loop-mediated isothermal amplification [LAMP] protocol), and antigen instead of genetic tests. There also is the hope for a paper strip-based test, as well as methods based on Raman-spectroscopy, breath, and more.10Vogels C et al., âSalivaDirect: Simple and sensitive molecular diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance,â medRxiv preprint, August 4, 2020, medrxiv.org.11Lalli M et al., âRapid and extraction-free detection of SARS-CoV-2 from saliva with colorimetric LAMP,â medRxiv preprint, May 11, 2020, medrxiv.org. Governments may choose to take an active role in introducing these technologies to the market. Potential support models include access to testing samples, accelerated certification trajectories, upfront investments, and even operational coordination across academia, labs, developers, and industrial suppliers and, potentially, in investment across borders. Some testing technologies have been proven in the lab, but will require an extraordinary investment to make them available at industrial scale in the course of months rather than years. These tests could make a major difference in limiting the virus spread this winter when vaccines will not be widely available. New tests could fill that period of time. Understanding the hidden costs of COVID-19’s potential impact on US healthcareRead the article 2. Organizing for success To successfully organize increased capacity, strong governance is key. Currently, in many countries, the roles and responsibilities along the diagnostic chain are highly fragmented, which means central coordination is truly cumbersome in times of (peak) crisis. We see the following ways to organize for success. End-to-end transparency Create a holistic overview of key performance indicators (Exhibit 4) that show the relationships in the diagnostic chain from the moment a person is infected until the last possible moment an infection can occur. 4 Dedicated operational control Build a nerve center to centrally coordinate the end-to-end testing process (Exhibit 5). 5 Clear roles and responsibilities. Make sure that roles and responsibilities are clear along the diagnostic chainâand that the variety of parties can be held accountable. This accountability is needed to decrease the risk of responsibilities falling between the cracks when pressure is put on the system. Aligned financial incentives Create a strategy for financial compensation of COVID-19 testing. Although compensation depends on the countryâs specific regulatory and financing systems, some common considerations exist. Typically, labs are compensated on a per-test basis. However, in the run up to the winter, labs are asked to ramp up their capacity in anticipation of an uncertain demand. Therefore, compensation schemes with fair risk-sharing should be created. For example, one could compensate a lab for having capacity ready, in the same way firefighters are compensatedânot by the number of fires they extinguish, but by their ready capacity to do so. Early investments in innovation Stakeholders may want to evaluate how innovative testing methods take time to develop and validate. It is challenging to speed up this process at will or fully at risk. Therefore, early decision making and technological investments by governments or government consortia are crucial to create the opportunity for the long-term impact that can stem from these innovations. The first wave of COVID-19 has taught us that responding to the crisis early and decisively acting is essential. Winter is coming, and it is increasingly clear that testing can help us unlock our lives and our economies faster and more confidently. Therefore, we expect that investments in innovationsâto ensure both an intelligent testing strategy and a strong governance systemâare vital. The lessons we have learned from the past months can help guide usâand support our ability to mitigate, or even prevent, a second wave.Daniel Cramer is a solution leader in McKinsey’s Amsterdam office, where Paul Rutten is a partner, and Audrey Stikkers is a consultant.

Mott Children's Hospital National Poll on Children's Health at Michigan Medicine. ANN ARBOR, Mich. -- The pandemic doesn't seem to be changing parents' minds about the importance of the flu vaccine. It could be a double whammy flu season this year as the nation already faces a viral deadly disease with nearly twin symptoms. And while public health experts have emphasized the importance of people of all ages receiving seasonal flu vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic, many parents may not be getting that message. Just a third of parents believe that having their child get the flu vaccine is more important this year, a national poll suggests. And as schools reopen for the first time since the novel coronavirus outbreak, one in three parents don't plan to vaccinate children against the flu, according to the C.S. Mott Children's Hospital National Poll on Children's Health at Michigan Medicine. "We may see peaks of flu and COVID-19 at the same time, which could overwhelm the health care system, strain testing capacity and potentially reduce our ability to catch and treat both respiratory illnesses effectively," says Mott Poll co-director Sarah Clark. "Our report finds that even during the pandemic, some parents don't see the flu vaccine as more urgent or necessary. This heightens concerns about how the onset of flu season may compound challenges in managing COVID-19." Influenza has led to between 9 to 45 million illnesses, 140,000 to 810,000 hospitalizations and 12,000 to 61,000 deaths a year since 2010, according to estimates by the Centers for Disease Control. Children younger than five, and especially those younger than two, are at high risk of developing serious flu-related complications. The CDC reported 188 pediatric flu deaths during the 2019-2020 flu season. The nationally representative Mott Poll report includes 1,992 responses from parents of children age 2-18 years who were surveyed in August. Families who were least likely to get children vaccinated against the flu were those who didn't do so last year - less than a third of those parents say their child will probably get a flu vaccine this year. In contrast, among parents who said their child got flu vaccine last year, nearly all (96%) intend to have their child get flu vaccine this year. "A key challenge for public health officials is how to reach parents who do not routinely seek seasonal flu vaccination for their child," Clark says. "When getting a yearly flu vaccine is not a pattern, parents need to be prompted to think about why it's essential for their child to get vaccinated." And according to the Mott Poll report, families whose provider strongly recommends vaccination are more likely to get children vaccinated against the flu. Still, less than half of parents say their child's regular health care provider strongly recommends that their child get the flu vaccine this year. Clark notes that this may be due to the impact of COVID on the health care delivery system, as many child health providers have limited the number of patients seen for in-person visits, with increased use of telehealth visits. This may reduce opportunities for providers to give a strong recommendation about flu vaccination for children and to answer parents' questions about flu vaccine safety and effectiveness. Given the decrease in in-person visits, child health providers should look for other strategies, such as reminder postcards or website banners to emphasize the importance of children getting the flu vaccine during this pandemic year, Clark says. Among the 32% of parents who say their child is unlikely to get a flu vaccine this year, the most common reasons include concerns about side effects or beliefs that it isn't necessary or effective. But experts say these notions are often based in misconceptions about the flu vaccine, which still offers the best protection against both contracting the virus and also developing severe influenza-related illness. "There is a lot of misinformation about the flu vaccine, but it is the best defense for children against serious health consequences of influenza and the risk of spreading it to others," Clark says. Fourteen percent of parents said they will not seek the flu vaccine because they are keeping children away from health care sites due to the risk of COVID exposure, according to the Mott Poll. "Most child health providers have made changes to their office environment to keep children safe during office visits and vaccinations," says Clark. "Parents who are concerned about COVID exposure should contact their child's provider to learn about what types of precautions have been put in place." Nine percent of parents also say their child is afraid of needles or does not want to the get flu vaccine, which prevents them from scheduling an immunization. Mott teams recommend several strategies, including using books and comfort positions to help alleviate fears and anxiety among young children. Parental intention regarding flu vaccine this year is also slightly lower for parents of teens compared to younger children (73% for children ages 2-4, 70% for ages 5-12 and 65% for ages 13-18.) Teens sometimes receive the flu vaccine outside of their usual health care provider office. Some of those options may be limited by COVID, Clark notes, including schools, health fairs, and walk-in clinics at a local health department. However, many retail pharmacies are also expanding their flu vaccine services to children during the pandemic. Reports from the state health department and CDC indicate that during the pandemic, the overall rates of childhood vaccinations dropped significantly in states like Michigan. Children appeared to be falling behind on vaccinations for diseases like measles and pertussis (whooping cough), magnifying public health concerns about kids potentially catching vaccine-preventable diseases. Experts say the flu vaccine will help limit the stress on health care systems during the pandemic by reducing the number of influenza-related hospitalizations and doctor visits, and decreasing the need for diagnostic tests to distinguish flu from COVID, which has similar symptoms. "Children should get the flu vaccine not only to protect themselves but to prevent the spread of influenza to family members and those who are at higher risk of serious complications," Clark says. ### Disclaimer: AAAS and EurekAlert! are not responsible for the accuracy of news releases posted to EurekAlert! by contributing institutions or for the use of any information through the EurekAlert system.

But to satisfy curious minds, TODAY asked the experts why this happens. "The quick and simple answer is we're putting a needle into the muscle of the arm and injecting fluid," said Marc Schechter, D.O., chief of family medicine at ProHEALTH. "That in itself can cause a little discomfort. The longer explanation revolves around why we're giving you the vaccine in the first place. The body takes a look at what's in (the vaccine) and starts developing an immune response. Your body is developing antibodies to whatever infection you're trying to prevent — in this case, influenza. That causes some swelling, redness, a little discomfort."In other words, it's just inflammation. One way to look at it is that the soreness is a sign that the vaccine is doing its job. But if you're among the lucky ones who don't experience soreness, that doesn't mean the flu shot isn't working. Different people have different reactions to the vaccine. (Different vaccines can also cause different reactions. For example, Schechter noted that the Tdap vaccine is known to be one of the more uncomfortable shots, likely because it's providing vaccines for three separate diseases: tetanus, diphtheria and whooping cough.)There are ways to minimize flu shot discomfort, though.RelaxDr. Jake Deutsch, M.D., clinical director of Cure Urgent Care, recommends tapping the arm for about 30 seconds before getting a flu shot to desensitize the area and make the injection less painful.Doctors often tap or massage the arm to distract the patient as well. Relaxing beforehand will make the shot more comfortable.Take pain relieversIf you typically experience lots of soreness after flu shots, it's fine to take a dose of acetaminophen or ibuprofen one or two hours before the shot, Schechter said.Or, if you find you're feeling really sore the next day, take it then.Try a cold compress — or a hot oneApplying a cold compress to the area of the injection can help soothe discomfort after the shot.A heating pad, or a dip in the Jacuzzi, may also work to ease muscle tension.Drink lots of water"Any degree of dehydration is going to exacerbate that muscle tension," Deutsch said.Doctors stress that any soreness from the flu shot should be minimal and last only a day or two.Overall, the flu shot shouldn't hurt all that much — and getting the flu will always be worse than a little bit of soreness.Experts say that it's especially important to get the flu vaccine this year, during the COVID-19 pandemic, to help rule out the influenza as a possibility in the event a patient gets sick, and also to keep hospitals clear in case coronavirus cases spike."This season more than ever, eliminating all possibilities for illness is that much more important," Deutsch said.Rheana MurrayRheana Murray is the essays editor for TODAY.com.

The added urgency stems in part from the symptoms it shares with COVID-19 and concerns about confusing them. (Sept. 14)APEvery September, like clockwork, my colleagues and I start delivering the same stern message to our patients and pretty much anyone else who will listen: Get a flu shot to protect yourself and those around you.Well, here we go again — except this year, in the midst of a pandemic, the vaccination plea is more urgent than ever before.With COVID-19 still circulating in our community and even gaining steam in some areas, a bad influenza season could have dire consequences — for you and for the medical system.More: Coronavirus updates Monday: 202 infectious cases in Lane CountyLet’s start with the risks for you and your loved ones. Both flu and COVID-19 are respiratory illnesses with similar symptoms, such as fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, congestion, body aches, chills and fatigue.We now know that people can contract COVID-19 and flu simultaneously. Even though flu is less deadly than COVID, an estimated 61,000 Americans died of the disease in the last bad flu season of 2017-18. Especially for those who are older or have underlying medical issues, an unprecedented flu-COVID double whammy could be deadly.We know that the effectiveness of the flu vaccine varies from year to year and person to person, and it’s never perfect. But we also know that even if you got a flu shot and still caught the disease, your symptoms would likely be milder than they would be if you hadn’t been vaccinated — and you’d be better able to withstand a dual flu-COVID infection.In addition to protecting you and those around you, getting a flu shot also will lessen the chances of our hospitals becoming overwhelmed by a surge of flu and COVID patients.One day last week, PeaceHealth Sacred Heart Medical Center at RiverBend in Springfield had nine COVID patients on our medical and intensive care units — the highest single-day number. Lane County Public Health is reporting bigger numbers and worrisome trends as we head into the fall.The worst-case scenario — an influx of COVID patients and a very bad flu season, especially if it’s on a national scale — keeps me awake at night. Although our staff is trained and prepared and our equipment supply adequate, high numbers of patients requiring intensive respiratory care could overburden caregivers, deplete supplies and make it harder to care for patients hospitalized for other reasons.We all hope that a safe, effective COVID vaccine will be available soon. But thankfully, we do have a safe, effective influenza vaccine. Help save lives by getting your flu shot.Some guidance:The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that anyone 6 months or older get an annual flu vaccine, including pregnant women.The best time to get your shot is anytime between now and the end of October (though it’s never too late while flu season is ongoing).PeaceHealth wants to make sure getting a flu shot this year is easy and convenient. The vaccine is available at all PeaceHealth Medical Group primary care clinics, including Pediatrics and Urgent Care. Some are offering drive-up flu shots. Visit www.peacehealth.org/flushot for more information.Finally, I want to remind everyone about the other steps we can take to collectively and effectively fight the transmission of flu and COVID-19:Practice social distancing of at least 6 feet at all times.Avoid large social gatherings.Wear a face covering in all public places, including outdoors if you aren’t able to maintain 6 feet of physical distance.Wash your hands often and thoroughly.Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze. Use the crook of your arm (not your hands) if you don’t have a tissue handy.Stay home if you are sick.Bob Pelz, M.D., is the PeaceHealth Oregon medical director of infection prevention and member of Gov.

Trump isn't the first US president to contract an illness while in office, let alone during a pandemic. In 1919, Woodrow Wilson contracted the disease known as the 1918 Spanish flu, and his doctor lied, telling the press the president had a cold. President William Henry Harrison died 34 days into his term after suffering from what was believed to be pneumonia. Franklin Delano Roosevelt was another president who battled illness in office — he suffered from polio and famously disguised the severity of the disease from the American public.

Vice President John Tyler became president following Harrison, though there was no rule that dictated this at the time.The 25th Amendment, which states that the vice president will become president if the president is removed from office due to resignation or death, was passed by Congress as an Amendment in 1965, and ratified in 1967, following the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Advertisement Zachary Taylor died during his second year in office after battling an illness thought to be cholera. Zachary Taylor.

Advertisement Woodrow Wilson contracted the 1918 influenza during the pandemic, and his doctor and wife tried to hide it from the public. Woodrow Wilson, the 28th U.S. President, poses for a portrait in this undated photo. AP Trump isn't the first president to fall ill during a pandemic.President Woodrow Wilson was in office amid the 1918 influenza pandemic, which the CDC considers the most severe pandemic in recent history and led to an estimated 20 million deaths worldwide.The Wilson administration reportedly tried to downplay the threat of the virus, which was named "the Spanish flu," and the president apparently never addressed the nation about the pandemic."Wilson never made a public statement about the pandemic. Never," John M. Barry, author of "The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History," told CNN.Barry also said that the flu impacted Wilson's stamina and his concentration, and affected "his mind in other, deeper ways," according to USA Today. In April 1919, Wilson contracted the virus while in Paris for the Big Four peace talks, and his doctor lied when speaking to the press, telling the public that Wilson had caught a cold from walking in the rain in the French city, according to the History Channel.Wilson's wife, Edith, also tried to conceal her husband's illness, telling people that he was overworked, Thomas Schwartz, a professor of history at Vanderbilt University, told NBC News.Wilson suffered a stroke in 1919, six months after contracting the flu, which left him partially paralyzed and blind, according to the History Channel. He died in 1924, three years after leaving office. Advertisement Warren G. Harding died while on a cross-country tour due to apparent heart failure. Warren G. Harding. Library of Congress Warren G. Harding's presidential term started in 1921 and ended in 1923 when he died, suddenly, at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco, one of the cities on his cross-country tour, according to the History Channel.Harding's death was attributed to congestive heart failure. Some experts believe he may have suffered multiple undiagnosed heart attacks months prior to his death, the History Channel says.That day, Vice President Calvin Coolidge became president and went on to serve one full term. Advertisement Franklin Delano Roosevelt battled polio, but he famously concealed the visible markers of his condition throughout his presidency. President Franklin D. Roosevelt waves to the crowd shortly before his public address on foreign affairs, Aug. 15, 1936, in Chautauqua, New York State. AP Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the 32nd US president, was diagnosed with polio — infantile paralysis — in 1921 when he was 39. He was paralyzed from the waist down.Upon becoming president in 1933, Roosevelt found ways to hide his disability from the public. In private, he used a wheelchair he designed himself using a dining chair and bicycle-like wheels, according to the FDR Presidential Library and Museum.In public, when arriving for a speaking engagement, Roosevelt developed a walking method — he used a cane and the arm of an adviser or his son, and he swayed his legs and hips forward to give the illusion of the movement, as described by the FDR Presidential Library and Museum.He also requested to not be photographed walking, and the Secret Service was instructed to intervene if anyone snapped a picture of Roosevelt appearing "disabled or weak."After four terms in office, on April 12, 1945, Roosevelt died of a cerebral hemorrhage at age 63 while at a retreat in Georgia. That day, Harry Truman, who was Vice President under Roosevelt, was sworn in as president. Advertisement Dwight D. Eisenhower recovered from a heart attack and stroke while in office. Dwight D. Eisenhower. Getty Images President Dwight D. Eisenhower "suffered several serious illnesses" during his first term, according to the National Institutes of Health.In 1955, Eisenhower had a heart attack, which the White House told the public was "a digestive upset," according to National Geographic.While Eisenhower was discouraged by a cardiologist against running for re-election in 1956, the president continued his campaign, and he later had an emergency surgery that led to his diagnosis of Crohn's Disease. In 1957, Eisenhower suffered a stroke but completed his presidential term. As Eisenhower's presidency predated the 25th Amendment, he formed an agreement in 1958 with Vice President Richard Nixon, which stated that Nixon would serve as Acting President if Eisenhower became unable to complete the duties. Advertisement During his presidency, John F. Kennedy suffered from chronic back pain and Addison's disease. John F. Kennedy. UniversalImagesGroup/Getty Images While in office, President John F. Kennedy quietly suffered from health complications. Prior to becoming president, Kennedy had a series of unsuccessful back surgeries in the 1940s and '50s, which were supposed to alleviate the chronic back pain, according to Dr. Howard Markel for PBS NewsHour.During much of his adult life, Kennedy often experienced so much back discomfort that he couldn't bend over to tie his own shoes, wrote Markel.Kennedy also wore a back brace during his presidency, and some physicians cite this as a contributing factor to his death by assassination.In addition to the back pain he experienced, Kennedy suffered from Addison's disease, which can cause patients to experience low blood pressure, diarrhea, vomiting, and fatigue, and can be fatal if left untreated, according to Markel.

The bullet just missed his heart, reported Politico. Reagan "walked unassisted into the emergency room" and made a full recovery, signing a bill while sitting in his hospital bed, according to Politico.In July 1985, Reagan underwent surgery to have cancerous tumors removed. During his procedure, he transferred presidential power to Vice President George H.W. Bush for about eight hours, according to the New York Times.Read more:Trump 'resting comfortably' at Walter Reed Medical Center where he will receive treatment for 'few days' after testing positive for COVID-19 and developing a fever and coughTrump's age, weight, and sex all make him more at risk of getting a severe coronavirus infectionWhite House physician says Trump is fever-free but dodged questions of whether he has ever received supplemental oxygen during coronavirus treatment Read next coronavirus Donald Trump White House Advertisement Close icon Two crossed lines that form an 'X'.

Pandemics have afflicted civilizations throughout human history, with the earliest known outbreak occurring in 430 BC during the Peloponnesian War. Many of these pandemics have had significant impacts on human society, from killing large percentages of the global population to causing humans to ponder larger questions about life. Here are 11 of the most momentous pandemics that altered the course of human history, including the coronavirus, declared a pandemic by the WHO on March 11. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. Advertisement Plague of Justinian (541 - 750 AD) Justinian I (483 - 565 AD) ruled the Byzantine (aka Eastern Roman) Empire, and reconquered much of the Western Roman Empire before losing it again. Bettmann/Getty Images The reign of Justinian I, the emperor of the Byzantine Empire in the 6th century, was hampered by an outbreak of bubonic plague. Now known as the Plague of Justinian, this pandemic is thought to have killed between 30 million and 50 million people, perhaps equal to as much as half of the world's population at the time.The Justinian plague definitely happened, but researchers are still poring over the evidence as to just how bad it was, about 1,500 years ago.The traditional narrative of this pandemic was that trade largely ceased and the empire was weakened, allowing other civilizations to reconquer previously Byzantine lands in the Middle East, Northern Africa, and parts of Asia. As Justinian was in the process of reuniting the eastern and western halves of the Roman empire when the plague hit, it has even been blamed as the true end of that era. Ultimately, we know how bad it could have been: half of the world died, the Roman Empire was never united again, and the Dark Ages began. Advertisement Black Death (1347 - 1351) Image from the Toggenburg Bible (1411) of plague victims suffering from boils. Wikimedia Commons Between 1347 and 1351, bubonic plague spread throughout Europe, killing approximately 25 million people. European population levels took over 200 years to return to their level from before 1347. It likely killed greater numbers in Asia, especially China, where it is thought to have originated.Other results of the pandemic, known later as the Black Death, was the beginning of the decline of serfdom as so many people had died that the survivors' standard of living actually increased. Workers had more work opportunities, and social mobility increased, while there was also a short-lived moratorium on warfare.Culturally, the cataclysm prompted an increase in mysticism as so much suffering challenged the religious dominance of the Roman Catholic Church. Reactions to the plague also included an upsurge in bigotry and scapegoating, with more instances of heightened prejudice and even pogroms against minorities including Jews and Roma. Advertisement Smallpox (15th - 17th centuries) Undated illustration depicting English physician Edward Jenner's first smallpox vaccination, performed on James Phipps in 1796. After a painting by GG Melingue. Bettmann/Getty Images Europeans introduced a number of new diseases when they first arrived in the continents of the Americas in 1492. One of these was smallpox, a contagious disease that kills around 30% of those infected.During this period, smallpox claimed the lives of approximately 20 million people, close to 90% of the population, in the Americas. The pandemic helped Europeans colonize and develop the newly vacated areas, forever altering the histories of the Americas, their European conquerors, and the global economy.The exploitation of the mineral wealth of the "New World" in the form of silver and gold from Latin America, for example, led to massive inflation within the farflung Spanish Empire. The great economic thinker John Maynard Keynes wrote in 1930 that this "price revolution" was a crucial turning point in the formation of modern capitalism. Advertisement Cholera (1817 - 1823) Patients wait at the Cholera Treatment Center of Diquini in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Thomson Reuters The first cholera pandemic began in Jessore, India, and spread through most of the region and then to neighboring areas. It was the first of 7 major cholera pandemics that have killed millions of people. A British physician named John Snow knew some things about how to prevent it from spreading, and in 1854 stemmed the outbreak by isolating its source to a particular water pump in London's Soho neighborhood.The World Health Organization has called cholera "the forgotten pandemic" and said that its seventh outbreak, which began in 1961, continues to this day. Cholera reportedly infects 1.3 million to 4 million people every year, with annual fatalities ranging from 21,000 to 143,000.As cholera is caused by ingesting food or water contaminated with a certain bacteria, it overwhelmingly harms countries hampered by extreme wealth inequality and lack of social development. Cholera continues to change the world by hurting the parts of it least able to defend themselves, while richer countries barely worry about it.

Underwood Archives/Getty Images The Spanish Flu, also known as the 1918 influenza pandemic, was an outbreak of a H1N1 virus that infected around 500 million people, or a third of the world's population, in the early 21st century. The pandemic was responsible for killing over 50 million people globally.At the time of the outbreak, World War I was coming to an end and public health authorities had no or few official protocols in place for dealing with viral pandemics, which contributed to its large impact.In the years to come, research into understanding how the pandemic happened and how it could have been prevented led to improvements in public health and helped lessen the impact of similar outbreaks of flu-like viruses afterward. Advertisement Hong Kong Flu, or H3N2 (1968 - 1970) A 2011 electron microscope image provided by the CDC showing the H3N2 influenza virus. Associated Press Fifty years after the Spanish Flu, another influenza virus, H3N2, spread around the world. Estimates put the number of global fatalities at around one million people, about 100,000 of which were in the US.The 1968 pandemic was the third outbreak of influenza to occur in the 20th century, the other two being the Spanish Flu in 1918 and the Asian flu pandemic of 1957. It is believed that the virus responsible for the Asian flu evolved and reemerged 10 years later into this so-called "Hong Kong flu," resulting in the H3N2 pandemic. The 21st century, though, has continued to see influenza outbreaks.While not as deadly as the 1918 influenza outbreak, H3N2 was exceptionally contagious, with 500,000 people becoming infected within 2 weeks of the first reported case, in Hong Kong. The pandemic helped the global health community understand the vital role of vaccinations in preventing future outbreaks. Advertisement HIV/AIDS (1981 - present) A man during an HIV/AIDS awareness campaign the day before World AIDS Day in Kolkata, India. Reuters The first known cases of HIV/AIDS were reported in 1981 but the disease continues to infect and kill people today. Since 1981, 75 million people have had the HIV virus and approximately 32 million have died as a result. As a sexually transmitted disease for which there is no cure, HIV/AIDS is a persistent epidemic that continues to impact millions of people every year. Despite the lack of a cure for AIDS, antiretroviral therapy medications can control HIV and slow its progress dramatically, allowing someone infected to live a long life.Basketball superstar Magic Johnson made history when he retired from the NBA in 1991, becoming the most prominent celebrity to go public with an HIV diagnosis at that time. Johnson remains a prominent businessman, and was part of a group that acquired the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team in 2012.The negative influence of HIV/AIDS on the global economy is still being studied, particularly in Africa, the continent which has the largest percentage of HIV/AIDS cases. In the 1980s and '90s, the global LGBTQ community became vocal and visible in unprecedented ways because of the disproportionate impact of HIV/AIDS on its members. One of the first mainstream films to address HIV/AIDS and homophobia was the Academy Award-winning "Philadelphia," released in 1993. Advertisement SARS (2002 - 2003) People wear masks as protection against the SARS virus as they wait to buy tickets at the Beijing Railway Station Wednesday, April 23, 2003. Greg Baker/ AP SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, is an illness caused by one of the 7 coronaviruses that can infect humans. In 2003, an outbreak that originated in the Guangdong province of China became a global pandemic as it rapidly spread to a total of 26 countries, infecting just over 8,000 people and killing 774 of them.The consequences of the 2003 SARS pandemic were largely limited due to an intense public health response by global authorities, including quarantining affected areas and isolating infected individuals. Scientists studying the new 2019 coronavirus have found that its genetic makeup is 86.9% identical to the SARS virus, and officials are now comparing the two to see if governments can successfully replicate any of the containment procedures from 2003.The SARS outbreak increased awareness about preventing viral disease transmission, particularly in Hong Kong, where public surfaces have been regularly sanitized since and facemasks have become a common sight. Advertisement Swine Flu, or H1N1 (2009 - 2010) A map shows the path of H1N1, or "swine flu," as it spread across the US in the fall of 2009. PLOS Computational Biology A new form of the influenza virus emerged in 2009, infecting approximately 60.8 million people in the US, with global deaths in the range of 151,700 to 575,400. Called the "swine flu" because it appeared to cross over from pigs to humans in transmission, H1N1 differed from typical influenza outbreaks in that 80% of the virus-related deaths occured in people younger than 65. Typically, 70% to 90% of deaths from influenza outbreaks occur in those older than 65.H1N1 demonstrated just how quickly a viral pandemic can spread in the 21st century, indicating that additional preparations would be needed for the global community to respond faster in the future. A major legacy of the swine flu may have been how it exposed the persistent vulnerability of many countries with advanced healthcare systems to a fast-moving, flu-like outbreak.

Jerome Delay/AP Photo The Ebola virus, named for a river close to the initial outbreak, was limited in its range compared to most modern pandemics but incredibly deadly. It began in a small village in Guinea in 2014 and spread to a handful of neighboring countries in West Africa. The virus killed 11,325 of the 28,600 infected people, with most cases occurring in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Of the 8 Americans who contracted Ebola, one died, according to the CDC.Ebola is estimated to have cost a total of $4.3 billion, with inbound investments dramatically dropping in the three countries above. Like "the forgotten pandemic" of cholera, Ebola most ravaged countries least equipped to defend against it.

Woohae Cho/Getty Images The ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus, which causes a disease known as COVID-19, has revealed vulnerabilities in the global community's response to outbreaks of viruses. On March 11, the WHO characterized the outbreak as a pandemic.As of September 2020, confirmed cases worldwide have surpassed 34 million with more than one million deaths. The CDC has recommended practicing social distancing. Theme parks and museums were shut down and major events around the globe were either canceled or postponed indefinitely.In six months, over 60 million Americans have filed for unemployment insurance. This number is higher than the claims filed during the 18-month long Great Recession. Travel, hospitality, and service sectors have been hit hard by layoffs and furloughs. On September 29, Disney announced it was cutting 28,000 theme park jobs. CNBC has previously reported that it had lost $3.5 million due to closures. Other major companies with layoffs and furloughs include Ralph Lauren, Dell, United Airlines. Ryder Kimball contributed reporting to this story. Read next coronavirus Health Arts & Culture More...

Judy Persichilli, a New Jersey health commissioner, said last week a vicious year of influenza, along with a predicted uptick in coronavirus cases by the end of the year, has the capacity to constrain healthcare resources across the state this fall. “This year, more than ever,” she said, “it is important that everyone six months of age or older get vaccinated against the flu.” By getting vaccinated, according to doctors, your body develops antibodies against influenza, reducing the risk of catching the disease and transmitting it to others. Flu vaccination can also protect children, women in pregnancy, working-age adults, and older adults from flu-associated hospitalizations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that anyone over the age of six months get the flu shot in the next few weeks, before the start of flu season. Experts suggest that people with life-threatening allergies to eggs or past flu vaccines talk with their doctor about what’s right for them. A high-dose vaccine {for people aged 65 or older} is available at most pharmacies. Flu providers recommend rescheduling your vaccine if you’ve been sick with fever or cough in the last 48 hours, or if you’ve been in close contact with someone who has coronavirus. A flu shot is free at most locations with Medicaid, Medicare, and nearly all private insurance plans. If needles make you squirm, ask about a nasal spray alternative, which scientists say is just as effective. Read on to find where you can get your flu shot in Hoboken + Jersey City today.

Like Covid-19, no one had immunity to it, and it was highly infectious, spreading through respiratory droplets that pass when an infected person coughed or sneezed.Several cities implemented mask mandates, describing them as a symbol of "wartime patriotism," but some people refused to comply or take them seriously.Members of the American Red Cross remove influenza victims in 1918.St. Louis Post-Dispatch | Tribune News Service via Getty ImagesIn less than nine months, the coronavirus has quickly spread to more than 33 million people across the globe, killing more than 1 million and becoming the third-leading cause of death in the United States, behind only heart disease and cancer. There is nothing in recent history that compares to a contagious crisis of this magnitude, according to historians who study infectious diseases and disasters. The H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009 infected an estimated 60.8 million people in its first year, but the virus wasn't nearly as severe as Covid-19, killing between 151,700 and 575,400 worldwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. MERS, another coronavirus that emerged in 2012, was much deadlier than Covid but significantly less infectious with only 2,494 reported cases.Covid-19 is "a scary virus and definitely one that you do not want to get," said Howard Markel, a physician and medical historian at the University of Michigan. "It's a very dangerous, very crafty, stealthy virus."The 1918 virus was also a "novel" virus, meaning it was brand new. Like Covid-19, no one had any immunity to it, and it was highly infectious, spreading through respiratory droplets that pass when an infected person coughed or sneezed.Different symptomsThe viruses attacked the body in different ways. Covid-19 can be mild, sometimes causing no symptoms whatsoever, or severe — putting patients in hospitals and on ventilators for weeks and leaving them with lingering effects of fatigue and coughing for months. Covid-19 can also be unpredictable, stressing virtually every system in the body, including the heart, kidneys and brain.The 1918 flu pandemic came in three waves, occurring in the spring of 1918, the fall of 1918; and the winter and spring of 1919, according to the CDC. The 1918 flu killed 50 million people worldwide from 1918 through 1919, including 675,000 Americans, according to the CDC. It is estimated that one-third of the world's population became infected with the virus.The first wave of the 1918 flu came with the usual flu symptoms: fever, nausea, body aches and diarrhea. The second wave was dramatically worse. It could set in suddenly, killing patients within days or even hours after symptoms began. The virus would cause their lungs to fill with fluid and the lack of oxygen would make their skin turn blue until they suffocated. There also wasn't a vaccine for the 1918 flu, and, like Covid-19, the crisis was highly politicized in the United States. watch nowVIDEO4:3904:39What would a second wave look like?CNBC Explains"We were getting involved in World War I and it was a very patriotic effort. You know, the war to end all wars," Markel said. "They were sending off young men in parades. Women were left behind and starting Red Cross chapters and making bandages and all sorts of things, sending the men off in a proper way."The pandemic became mixed in with the patriotic fervor, he said.Like today, schools and businesses were closed and infected people were quarantined, according to influenzaarchive.org.1918 mask mandates"You told people to wash your hands, don't cough on people, stay at home, stay away from other people," he said. "It was the patriotic thing to do to not cough on people or stay home if you were sick."But the thing that really drew public backlash were mask recommendations. As it turns out, resistance to wearing the face coverings isn't new. People during the 1918 pandemic called them dirt traps and some clipped holes so they could smoke cigars. In Europe, the Italian Supreme Command asked residents not to fail their cities by not wearing a mask. Several U.S. cities implemented mandates, describing them as a symbol of "wartime patriotism." In San Francisco, Mayor James Rolph said, "conscience, patriotism and self-protection demand immediate and rigid compliance," according to influenzaarchive.org. But some people refused to comply or take them seriously, Markel said.San Francisco residents considered masks a nuisance while others harbored resentment for being forced to wear them, he said. Some of them were arrested."One woman, a downtown attorney, argued to Mayor Rolph that the mask ordinance was 'absolutely unconstitutional' because it was not legally enacted, and that as a result, every police officer who had arrested a mask scofflaw was personally liable," according to influenzaarchive.org.Pandemic newsThe news in 1918 didn't flow as quickly as it does today with the internet and smartphones, but it also couldn't be manipulated as much as today and newspapers published at least six or seven editions a day back then, Markel said. State public health departments also held regular public press briefings, he added. "If you wanted to partake on it, it was there," he said. Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT) lift a patient into an ambulance while wearing protective gear, as the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues, in New York City, New York, March 24, 2020.Stefan Jeremiah | ReutersSome newspapers referred to the virus as the "Spanish flu," even though the first known case was reported at an army base in Kansas. Spain remained neutral throughout World War I and reported on the virus freely, giving the impression that the outbreak was bad there. Eventually, newspapers would just refer to it as "influenza" or the "influenza epidemic," Markel said.Woodrow Wilson vs Donald TrumpAdditionally, some reports have suggested that then-President Woodrow Wilson downplayed the virus, but that is a "wrong and a false trope of popular history," Markel said. Wilson, who would later contract the virus, was organizing and commanding the U.S. effort in World War I and once the war ended, he sailed for Paris, where he stayed until April of 1919 organizing a peace treaty and the League of Nations, Markel said. "The federal government played a very small role in American public health during that era. It was primarily a city and state role and those agencies were hardly downplaying it," he said. Unlike today, there was no CDC or national public health department. The Food and Drug Administration existed but consisted of a very small group of men. Additionally, there were no antibiotics, intensive care units, ventilators, IV fluids or vaccines. "You got a bed or maybe nursing care," Markel said.But there was an epidemiologist much like Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who withstood criticism for publicly pressing for safety protocols, according to Forbes. "At the center of public health efforts in both states was a practical, plainspoken, bespectacled scientist: Dr. Thomas Dyer Tuttle, who became a powerful, if polarizing, figure in the fight against the Spanish flu," according to Forbes. Scientists hadn't even seen a virus under the microscope at that point, said Graham Mooney, a medical historian at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. They didn't have the technology and they knew almost nothing of virology, which was considered a nascent science because viruses are so small, he said. In fact, some scientists thought the 1918 virus was caused by a bacteria called Haemophilus influenzae, he said."Now we have a much greater capacity to create a preventative mechanism through immunizations and vaccinations," Mooney said. Massive death tollThe 1918 virus also tended to kill differently than Covid-19, Mooney and Markel noted. With World War I, there was a massive movement of men across all of America and Europe. While the coronavirus can be especially severe for the elderly and those with underlying health conditions, the 1918 virus was unusual in that it killed many young adults, Markel said."Influenza generally has a U shaped mortality curve, meaning it looks like a U, but the tops of the U are the most deadly," Markel said. "But in 1918 it was a W shaped mortality curve and that upside-down part of the W, the V, was young people between ages 18 and 40 dying like flies. That was odd. That was not typical for previous flu pandemics or subsequent ones."It's also important to consider population when talking about outbreaks or disasters, said Samantha Montano of the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, who studies disasters. In 1918, the world population was much smaller with an estimated 1.8 billion people. Today, there are nearly 8 billion on the planet.Mooney echoed those remarks, saying, "We're talking about a global population that is sort of smaller than it is now." He said the death toll from 1918 virus likely had a great impact on the workforce who were unable to work from home or remotely like we can today."You end up having major structural, economic and social readjustments when you have such a massive death toll like that," he said. "We have social welfare networks ... people travel around the globe. We have different societies and economies."Medical historians say the U.S. can learn from the 1918 virus."It is utterly earth-shaking what we've done in the last century alone," Markel said. watch nowVIDEO2:0902:09This 106-year-old family business survived the Spanish influenza – but its fourth-generation owner says they've never seen anything like thisCoronavirusSubscribe to CNBC PROSubscribe to Investing ClubLicensing & ReprintsCNBC CouncilsSupply Chain ValuesCNBC on PeacockJoin the CNBC PanelDigital ProductsNews ReleasesClosed CaptioningCorrectionsAbout CNBCInternshipsSite MapAd ChoicesCareersHelpContactNews TipsGot a confidential news tip?

Advertisement One of the best ways to stay healthy through the winter is to get a flu vaccine, which protects you against the influenza virus and flu symptoms like fever, coughing, and congestion. Yet, a majority of US adults skip getting the flu shot each year – during the 2018-2019 flu season, only 45% of adults got a flu vaccine. Some may worry about mild side effects like achy muscles from the flu shot, but getting vaccinated can help you avoid serious complications like pneumonia and keep you out of the hospital. Here are some of the pros and cons of getting a flu shot. Advertisement Pros of the flu shotGetting vaccinated for the flu is an important step to protect your health, and may also benefit the people around you. Here are some of the advantages of getting the flu shot.1. Prevents the fluOn years when the vaccine is a good match, it is able to prevent 40% to 60% of flu infections. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), flu vaccines prevented 4.4 million cases of the flu and 3,500 deaths during the 2018 to 2019 flu season.The flu shot works by injecting proteins from the influenza virus into your bloodstream. Your immune system reacts by generating specialized immune cells called antibodies that can fight off the flu virus. These antibodies stay in your system throughout the flu season and can stop you from getting sick or make a flu infection much less severe. Advertisement 2. Even if you do get the flu, it will likely be less severeIt's still possible to get the flu even if you've had the flu shot, but your infection may be less severe. This is because after getting a flu shot, your immune cells are more likely to recognize the flu virus as a threat and fight it off more quickly.A study published in 2015 in the journal Vaccine found that vaccinated adults with a flu infection were less likely to have a fever over 101 degrees, but were more likely to have muscle aches, compared with unvaccinated people. Vaccinated people's symptoms also cleared up faster – they had 1 to 2 days less of fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath.Vaccinated adults were also between 52% and 79% less likely to die from the flu, compared with people who had not gotten a flu shot. Advertisement 3. The flu shot can keep you out of the hospitalMost cases of the flu are mild and don't require medical treatment. But in some cases, a flu infection can lead to life-threatening complications, like pneumonia, that need to be treated at a hospital. The flu shot can keep you out of the hospital by helping your immune system recognize and fight the infection more quickly and effectively.The CDC estimates that between 140,000 and 960,000 people are hospitalized for flu infections each year, depending on how bad the flu season is. But an estimated 91,000 hospitalizations are also avoided each year, thanks to the flu vaccine. People most at risk of developing a serious complication include:Adults over 65Pregnant peopleChildren under 2 years oldPeople with chronic health conditions like asthma or diabetes Advertisement 4. The flu shot could save you moneyIf you end up in the hospital with a severe flu infection, the costs can be extremely high. Adults hospitalized for flu infection end up spending around $18,000 for an average 6-day hospital stay. Children under 4 and adults over 85 tend to stay about 4-6 days in the hospital and can rack up a bill of around $12,400.So getting vaccinated can potentially save you thousands of dollars by keeping you out of the hospital. And — bonus — most insurance plans cover the cost of a flu shot so it's free. If you don't have insurance, expect to pay around $20 to $40 to get your flu shot at a pharmacy. Advertisement 5. Protects the public"By getting a flu vaccine, you are not only protecting yourself, you are stopping the spread of the virus," says Laura Haynes, PhD, a professor of immunology at the University of Connecticut Center on Aging. This is because of herd immunity, which means that "the more people in the population who are immune to flu infection, the less likely it will be to spread easily."This may be particularly helpful to protect your older friends or relatives, who may be at greatest risk, Haynes says. Building up herd immunity is also important to protect babies under 6 months old who cannot get the flu shot. Advertisement Cons of the flu shotA flu vaccine can help keep you and your loved ones healthy, but it comes with some discomfort and can't completely shield you from infection. Here are some of the cons that come with getting the flu shot.1. Side effects of the flu shotThere are some side effects of the flu shot, but they tend to be mild and only last for 1 to 2 days. Some common side effects include:Low-grade feverHeadacheMuscle achesFeeling nauseousSwelling, soreness, or redness around the area of the injectionThough the symptoms are similar to a very mild flu, "The vaccine can NOT give you the flu," Haynes says, as it does not contain any live virus that could spread infection."The only folks who should not get a flu vaccine are those that have had a severe reaction to one in the past," Haynes says. Though allergic reactions to the flu shot are rare, if you develop symptoms like difficulty breathing or hives, you should get medical help immediately. Advertisement 2. You may still get the fluGetting a flu shot doesn't guarantee that you won't get the flu. It takes about two weeks for your body to build up an immunity to the flu virus, leaving you vulnerable to infection during that time.Moreover, 40% to 60% of people who get the flu shot may still become ill – but it can make your symptoms much milder. Advertisement The bottom lineThough the flu shot may come with some discomfort, it reduces your risk of serious illness or even death. Getting vaccinated can also help save you money on healthcare and help protect your community from infection. For the best protection, make an appointment to get a flu shot at the start of flu season during September or October.

Getting a flu shot now could help decrease the burden on the health care system during the overlapping flu season and COVID-19 pandemic. (Navy photo by Dale Davis) By: FEDweek StaffNearly all Navy personnel must receive an influenza vaccination as soon as it is available to them, the service stated in a directive to all hands. “The seasonal influenza vaccination is mandatory for all DoD uniformed personnel who are not medically or administratively exempt,” the directive stated. “Any refusal to receive [the flu shot] will constitute a failure to obey a lawful order and may be punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice and/or result in administrative action.” The directive also stated that Navy civilian employees are required to get flu shots. The inoculations will be available to TRICARE beneficiaries free of charge. The COVID-19 (novel coronavirus) pandemic “is not a contraindication for administration” of flu shots, the directive stated. Should a vaccine for COVID-19 become available while the health care system is meting flu shots, the Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED) will issue further instructions. Ships, operational assets and training commands have priority for receiving the vaccine. Once these or any commands’ medical teams receive their supply of flu vaccine, service members stationed at them will have 72 hours to get their flu shots. They also must be able to provide proof of having done so. More in: Armed Forces News Like this article?

As coronavirus cases continue to rise, it’s important to be able to tell the difference between the symptoms of a common cold, influenza and COVID-19. But this also may be difficult to do.Influenza, the common cold and COVID-19 are all contagious respiratory illnesses, and are caused by different viruses. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 is caused by infection with a new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2), the flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses and the common cold is caused by countless viruses such as rhinovirus and coronavirus. Story continues below advertisement Dr. Jerome Leis, medical director of infection prevention and control at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, said there are subtle differences between all three sicknesses, but they can be difficult to determine. 2:11 Flu shot recommended to ease pandemic burden on hospitals “It’s unfortunately impossible to reliably distinguish the cold from a virus-like influenza or COVID-19,” he said. “The symptoms are just too non-specific. And we know from COVID-19 that there is a wide spectrum of different presentations, (including) extremely mild symptoms that could resemble the common cold. So, unfortunately, we can’t distinguish those without testing.”Here are some differences in the illnesses.

The main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, a persistent dry cough, and fatigue, according to Health Canada. Story continues below advertisement Other symptoms include shortness of breath, a loss of sense of taste and smell, and a rash on skin or discolouration of fingers or toes. This can also be accompanied by aches and pains, a headache and gastrointestinal symptoms (such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, or vomiting).Upper respiratory symptoms, like runny nose and sinus congestion, are very uncommon in COVID-19.“There are some symptoms that might be potentially distinguishing like the loss of taste or smell that’s widely reported … (or) change in the skin that might occur. But I really would not rely on those for people to self-diagnosis with COVID-19,” Leis explained. 0:43 This is what can happen to your lungs when you have coronavirus The fluThe most common symptoms of influenza are fever, fatigue, a dry cough, aches and pains and headaches. Some people may experience a sore throat and a runny or stuffy nose. Diarrhea can sometimes occur in children. Story continues below advertisement Sneezing is usually not associated with the flu, but shortness of breath can develop.Because COVID-19 and the flu tend to affect the lungs and lead to severe complications, the two illnesses can be very difficult to distinguish, according to Dr. Zain Chagla, an infectious disease expert with McMaster University.“Unfortunately muscle pains, cough, fever, nausea, shortness of breath, all of those fit COVID-19. And they fit influenza. So from a clinical standpoint, they’re very hard to distinguish,” he said.Common coldWhile you may feel miserable when you have a cold, the symptoms are generally mild compared to the other viruses.

Speaking at the Ministry of Health’s press conference today, Manager of the Expanded Programme on Immunization, Grace Sookchand, explained that this vaccine has more to offer than its predecessor. “There are two types of the influenza; Type A and B and for both Type A (H1N1 and H3N2), the component has been changed to match the circulating virus as well as for the Type B virus. So, yes, the vaccine has been upgraded and definitely to match the season,” she said. With these additions, the vaccine is essentially new. This means that even those who would have taken the annual vaccine earlier this year, can and should take this new one as soon as possible. Chief Medical Officer, Dr Roshan Parasram added that as another advantage, getting the vaccine would help patients and health care providers to be able to differentiate between whether a person has COVID-19 or a seasonal flu. “If someone has the vaccine, based on the efficacy of the vaccine, once the physician asks that when taking history from the person that has flu-like symptoms and they would have had the vaccine, then the likelihood of it being influenza would be less,” he said. It’s a solid assist in the face of the pandemic since Dr Parasram said there are very few ways to know the difference between the flu and COVID-19. To be sure, he’s calling on everyone with symptoms for either to present themselves for testing so that health authorities can treat them effectively. “There’s a lot of the same symptoms that present with both (COVID-19 and the flu), there has been some research that has said that with COVID-19 you see more of loss of taste and loss of smell, but that can occur with influenza as well. “One of the only ways we can actually tell the difference is to have a test done. So, anyone with flu-like symptoms, we are asking you to present and we will have your COVID-19 test done," he implored. Dr Parasram added that with a COVID-19 sample done, even if it’s negative, it could help them deduce what specific ailment you could be facing. “The Caribbean Public Health Agency is able to test for H1N1, H3N2, the Type B viruses and 13 other pathogens of the respiratory type. So, once you have a negative COVID-19 test, we can test for other viruses that are in circulation,” he added. The flu season starts from tomorrow, October 1 and will persist until May. Citizens with pre-existing conditions like diabetes, hypertension and other comorbidities are advised to get vaccinated at the soonest possible time. The advice is also applicable for children and pregnant women. Loop is better in the app. Customize your news feed, save articles for later, view your reading history and more.

He knows first-hand the devastation that can be caused by the flu. This is his story. In May 2017 I developed some flu-like symptoms and needed to take some time off work. I hadn’t got my flu vaccine that year, for no good reason at all. Braden I didn’t get it done simply out of laziness. I didn’t think I could get the flu: I thought I’m young: I just didn’t think I would get it. I ended up developing a secondary bacterial pneumonia (I lost half of my air capacity in my left lung) and sepsis. I had chest pain that didn’t go away after seven hours. I went to hospital and ended up in a resus bed. After two days of testing I was diagnosed with myopericarditis* secondary to the infection with a mild pericardial effusion**. I spent two weeks in the critical care unit and then was discharged home for a month. It then took three months of ‘light duties’ at work before I could respond to patients again. I am very lucky to have recovered like I have with no permanent effects. The flu, while mild for most people, can be debilitating and having experienced some of the worst effects of the influenza virus, I would not want this to happen to any of my friends or family. It takes only a couple of minutes to be vaccinated. By getting the jab we can all work together to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our community. More information: *Myopericarditis is inflammation of both the heart muscle and pericardium (the sac surrounding the heart). **Mild pericardial effusion is small amount of fluid between the heart and the sac that surrounds it. Both cases are caused mostly by infection.
