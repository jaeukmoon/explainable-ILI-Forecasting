However, neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant viruses have already been identified from various influenza virus isolates. Here, we report the development of a class of macrocyclic peptides that bind the influenza viral envelope protein hemagglutinin, named iHA. Of 28 iHAs examined, iHA-24 and iHA-100 have inhibitory effects on the in vitro replication of a wide range of Group 1 influenza viruses. In particular, iHA-100 bifunctionally inhibits hemagglutinin-mediated adsorption and membrane fusion through binding to the stalk domain of hemagglutinin. Moreover, iHA-100 shows powerful efficacy in inhibiting the growth of highly pathogenic influenza viruses and preventing severe pneumonia at later stages of infection in mouse and non-human primate cynomolgus macaque models. This study shows the potential for developing cyclic peptides that can be produced more efficiently than antibodies and have multiple functions as next-generation, mid-sized biomolecules.

Human H1N1 and H3N2 viruses are highly contagious and cause respiratory disorders with high morbidity and mortality2. In addition, highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses sporadically transmit to humans with a high fatality rate. Although neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors are globally approved for influenza treatment, NA inhibitor-resistant viruses have already been isolated among seasonal H1N13,4, pandemic (H1N1) 20095,6,7, and even highly pathogenic avian H5N18,9 viruses. These resistant viruses can only be controlled by an alternative antiviral with a mechanism of action that is totally different from NA inhibition.Hemagglutinin (HA), an envelope protein of the influenza virus that forms trimers on the surface of the virions, plays a critical role in the virus replication cycle. HA mediates cell attachment through binding to receptor molecules and low pH-dependent membrane fusion in endosomes10. Although HA is classified into 16 subtypes based on its antigenicity, all HA molecules share the same fundamental biological function10. Since HA is the most immunogenic among influenza viral proteins and HA-targeted antibodies have the potential to neutralize HA-mediated virion-cell binding10, several HA-specific monoclonal antibodies have been established and demonstrated to be useful as anti-influenza drugs. However, the antibody binding sites on HA are frequently mutated, and thus escape mutants are easily generated. Moreover, the molecular size of antibodies is comparable to that of the HA trimer, thus limiting access to the HA functional domain.An emerging screening technology, the Random non-standard Peptides Integrated Discovery (RaPID) system, is constructed by combining mRNA display technology with the Flexible In vitro Translation (FIT) system, which consists of the artificial ribozyme “flexizyme” and an Escherichia coli-reconstituted cell-free translation system. This technology allows us to freely express thioether-macrocyclic peptides incorporating non-standard amino acids in a custom-made in vitro translation system and display this massive library (greater than 1012 members) on cognate mRNA templates. The recent development of the RaPID system enables the identification of high-affinity ligands for a protein of interest from easily prepared libraries consisting of over a trillion macrocyclic peptides11,12,13.In this work, to devise smaller molecules capable of binding to influenza viral HA as potential antiviral agents14 (Supplementary Fig. 1a), we use the RaPID system to obtain HA-targeting macrocycles, named iHAs. Among candidate iHAs, iHA-24 and iHA-100 show inhibitory effects on the in vitro replication of a wide range of Group 1 influenza viruses. Notably, iHA-100 bifunctionally inhibited viral adsorption and membrane fusion, both of which are mediated by HA. The binding site for iHA-100 in HA is the stalk domain, which is highly conserved among various subtypes of the influenza virus. Moreover, iHA-100 exhibits efficacy in inhibiting virus growth and preventing severe pneumonia at later stages of infection in mouse and non-human primate cynomolgus macaque models.ResultsMacrocycles iHA-100 and iHA-24 inhibit Group 1 influenza A virusesIn the RaPID system, iterative selection rounds were performed to enrich potent macrocyclic binders against recombinant HA derived from the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1/VietNam1203; clade 1) or A/Bar-Headed goose/Qinghai Lake/1 A/05 (H5N1/Qinghai Lake: clade 2.2) (Supplementary Fig. 1b). We utilized two libraries of thioether-macrocycles in which the random region consists of only proteinogenic amino acids or both 11 proteinogenic and four types of N-methyl-amino acids of choice15. The latter library was designed to assure greater metabolic stability than the former type with simple thioether-macrocyclic peptides. After five rounds of selection, we found an appreciable increase in the cDNA recovery rate. Sequencing of 69 molecular clones from the selected cDNAs revealed 28 candidates for an inhibitor of HA (iHA) (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Twenty-four iHA candidates (iHA-1–24) and four iHA candidates (iHA-100–103) were identified against the HA protein of H5N1/VietNam1203 and H5N1/Qinghai Lake, respectively. Of the 28 candidates, eight iHA macrocycles (iHA-11, −12, −14, −18, −19, −23, −24, and −100) (Fig. 1a) inhibited plaque formation of the low pathogenic H5N1 avian virus A/duck/Hokkaido/Vac-3/07 (H5N1/Vac-3) (Fig. 1b, left panel).Fig. 1: Macrocycles iHA-100 and iHA-24 inhibit Group 1 influenza A viruses.a HA-targeted macrocycles selected with the RaPID system. Amino acid sequences of the selected HA-binding macrocycle candidates are shown. Images of protein molecules were created using the software program PyMOL. b (left panel), Eight iHA macrocycles (iHA-11, −12, −14, −18, −19, −23, −24, and −100, NT; without iHA) inhibited plaque formation of the low pathogenic H5N1 avian virus A/duck/Hokkaido/Vac-3/07 (H5N1/Vac-3). (right panel), Binding of the iHAs to influenza viruses. RNAs were extracted from A/duck/Hokkaido/Vac-3/07 (H5N1/Vac-3) virus bound to biotin-iHAs and subjected to real-time PCR to quantify viral RNAs according to the M gene. Relative RNA amounts associated with each biotin-iHA to that of the iHA-4sf control macrocycle, which consists of a scrambled iHA-4 amino acid sequence, are shown. Error bars indicate standard deviations (SD) of three replicates, and the results showed are representative of two biologically independent experiments. c Chemical structure of iHA-24 (left) and iHA-100 (right) macrocycles. d–k Effect of the selected macrocycles on plaque formation by Group 1 influenza viruses. Percentage (%) of plaque reduction normalized to the untreated control is indicated. Results are mean values from three biologically independent experiments, and error bars indicate the SD of three replicates. Viral strains are H5N1/Vac-3 (clade unclassified) (d), H5N1/Vietnam (clade 1) (e), H5N1/Mongolia (clade 2.2) (f), H5N1/Hokkaido (clade 2.3.2.1) (g), H1N1/PR8 (h), pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses H1N1/Tokyo2619 (i), H1N1/Narita (j), and H2N2/Adachi (k). MDCK cells were infected with 100 PFU of each virus that was pre-treated with 0.01, 0.1, or 1 µM iHA-24 or iHA-100. At 1 h post-infection, cells were washed and overlaid with agarose medium containing 0.01, 0.1, or 1 µM of either the indicated macrocycle or zanamivir. After 48–72 h of incubation, plaque numbers were counted and divided by their back-titration counterparts (i.e., plaque numbers formed by untreated viruses in agarose medium without the macrocycle or zanamivir).Full size imageTo determine if the iHA macrocycles bound to influenza viruses, we established a pull-down assay for the quantification of peptide-associated viral RNAs. Higher copy numbers of the viral RNA were detected in the avidin-biotin complex with each of the eight iHAs tested compared to a control biotinylated peptide (Fig. 1b, right panel). Thus, iHAs potently bind to not only recombinant HA but also influenza virions, indicating that the nature of this inhibitory activity of iHAs is their strong binding to HA.Among these macrocycles, iHA-24 and iHA-100 (structures are shown in Fig. 1c) remarkably reduced the plaque numbers of H5N1/Vac3 (Fig. 1d) and their sizes (Supplementary Fig. 2), and also inhibited plaque formation of different antigenicities among clades of H5N1 viruses: A/Vietnam/UT3040/04 (H5N1/Vietnam; clade 1), A/whooper swan/Mongolia/3/05 (H5N1/Mongolia; clade 2.2), and A/whooper swan/Hokkaido/1/08 (H5N1/Hokkaido; clade 2.3.2.1) (Fig. 1e-g). Intriguingly, iHA-24 and iHA-100 were also more effective against the H1N1 virus laboratory strain, A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1/PR8), the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus A/Tokyo/2619/09 (H1N1/Tokyo2619), and A/Narita/1/09 (H1N1/Narita) than zanamivir (Fig. 1h-j). Moreover, iHA-24 and iHA-100 inhibited the H2N2 virus (Fig. 1k, Supplementary Table 1). HAs of H1N1, H2N2, and H5N1 viruses belong to the Group 1 HA subtype. Consistent with these data, iHA-24 and iHA-100 bound to HA on H1N1 and H2N2 virions (Supplementary Fig. 3). Thus, iHA-24 and iHA-100 inhibited the replication of a wide range of Group 1 influenza viruses via interaction with HAs.iHA-100 bifunctionally inhibits viral adsorption and membrane fusion through binding to the stalk domain of HAViral replication steps including adsorption, endocytosis, fusion, and uncoating are required for influenza A virus invasion of host cells16. To investigate the mechanism of the neutralizing activity of iHA-100, we examined whether iHA-100 actually interferes with the adsorption of the virus to host cells. H5N1/Vac-3 was pre-treated with iHA-100 and then adsorbed to Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells on ice to prevent endocytosis. The virus-adsorbed cells were extensively washed, and residual viral RNA was measured. iHA-100 inhibited the adsorption of H5N1/Vac-3 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2a, IC50 = 0.036 µM). Moreover, the KD value of iHA-100 binding to recombinant HA protein was estimated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to be 1.5 nM (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 4).Fig. 2: In vitro characterization of iHA-100.Results are shown as mean values and are representative of three biologically independent experiments. Error bars indicate SD of three replicates. a Effect of iHA-100 on the adsorption of H5N1 to host cells. H5N1/Vac-3 (2.5 × 104 PFU) is pre-treated with various concentrations of iHA-100 (0.01, 0.1, or 1 µM) for 1 h and then adsorbed to MDCK cells (5 × 104 cells) on ice for 1 h. The virus-adsorbed cells are extensively washed and used for qRT-PCR. Virus adsorption is represented as the relative value of a nontreated virus. b Single-cycle kinetic analysis of the interaction between HA and iHA-100 by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). SPR kinetic data of iHA-100 binding to H5 HA is shown. c, d Time course of the addition of iHA-100. H5N1/Vac-3 was pre-treated with the macrocycles (−1 h; pre-attachment), or virus-adsorbed cells were added at 0 h (post-attachment), 20 min (endocytosis), 1 h (HA acidification), 1.5 h (fusion), or 3 h (uncoating) after infection. At 8 h after infection, infected cells were lysed and used for western blotting. e, f Effect of iHA-100 on virus spread. MDCK cells were infected with H5N1/Vac-3 at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 and treated with iHA-100 at 3 h after infection in the absence (e) or presence (f) of trypsin. The absence of trypsin resulted in complete inhibition of virus spread. At 0, 4, 8, and 24 h after infection, RNAs were prepared from infected cells and used for qRT-PCR. g Effect of iHA-100 on influenza viral HA-mediated polykaryon formation. HEK293 cells transiently expressing HA from A/Vietnam/1194/04 (H5N1; clade 1) were trypsinized and exposed to low pH. After incubation at 37 °C for 6 h, HA (green in left images) and nuclei (red in left images) were visualized with immunofluorescence staining. The polykaryons are indicated by dotted ovals. Right panel: Percentage (%) of polykaryon formation normalized to the no treatment (NT) control was indicated. Vertical error bars indicate the SD of five randomly selected fields (g). iHA-12sf is a control macrocycle that consists of a scrambled iHA-12 amino acid sequence. h, Structure of HA and escape mutants. HA mutations found in escape mutants from iHA-100 are indicated in a schematic diagram of the three-dimensional structures of the HA trimer (created by PyMOL software). i iHA-100 and anti-HA stalk Ab protected HA from low pH-induced protease sensitivity. Exposure to low pH rendered H5 HA sensitive to trypsin digestion, but iHA-100 prevented conversion to the protease-susceptible conformation. 14A7 and CR6261 are anti-HA head and stalk antibodies, respectively. CR6261 functioned as a positive control in the trypsin susceptibility assays. HA was detected in immunoblots with rabbit anti-H5 HA antibody.Full size imageTo further examine the target of iHA-100 after adsorption, iHA-100 was applied at the virus infection steps of uncoating and fusion (Fig. 2c). Virus replication was inhibited by iHA-100 treatment at −1 h, 0 h, 0.3 h, 1 h, and 1.5 h after infection, but uncoating at 3 h after infection was not inhibited (Fig. 2d). The negative control peptide iHA-12sf, which has a scrambled iHA-12 amino acid sequence (see “Methods” section for details), did not inhibit virus entry. Thus, the fusion step may be a critical target of iHA-100. Furthermore, MDCK cells infected with H5N1/Vac-3 at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 were treated with iHA-100 3 h after infection in the absence (Fig. 2e) or presence (Fig. 2f) of trypsin. Virus spread occurs in an HA-dependent manner in the presence of trypsin, but no virus spread is observed in the absence of trypsin. As shown in Fig. 2f, treatment with iHA-100 3 h after infection completely inhibited viral RNA replication as in the absence of trypsin (Fig. 2e), indicating inhibition of viral spread.To characterize the inhibition of viral fusion by iHA-100, we tested its effect on HA-mediated membrane fusion activity using the polykaryon formation assay. The membrane fusion activity was assessed by counting polykaryon numbers. Polykaryon formation mediated by H5 and H1 HAs was significantly inhibited by iHA-100 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2g, and Supplementary Fig. 5). We further confirmed the inhibitory effect of iHA-100 on membrane fusion with a red blood cell (RBC) fusion assay (Supplementary Fig. 6). Thus, iHA-100 inhibited HA-mediated membrane fusion. Taken together, iHA-100 shows potent neutralization activity by inhibiting HA-mediated adsorption, fusion, and virus spread (Fig. 2a, d, f, g).To map potential binding site(s) of macrocycles to HA, we isolated escape mutants (Fig. 2h, Supplementary Fig. 7). After three serial passages of H1N1/PR8 or H5N1/Vac-3 in cultured cells in the presence of iHA-100, we isolated 10 clones that formed plaques in the presence of 0.1 µM iHA-100 more efficiently than the parental virus. The HA gene sequences of these escape mutants were determined. Escape mutations against iHA-100 were located in the stalk domain (Fig. 2h, Supplementary Fig. 7a), which is highly conserved between Group 1 HAs. In addition, we confirmed that these mutations were responsible for the reduced sensitivity to iHA-100 (Supplementary Fig. 7b, c). These substitutions may change the conformation of the stalk domain, decreasing the accessibility of iHA-100.To gain initial insight into possible stalk binding of iHA-100, we examined whether iHA-100 can protect HA protein from pH-induced protease degradation. Stalk-targeting Abs like CR6261 stabilize the prefusion conformation and block HA conformational change at low pH and subsequent susceptibility to trypsin17,18. In our trypsin susceptibility assay, HA was normally degraded by trypsin completely at acidic pH and partially at neutral pH, but when incubated with iHA-100 or CR6261, HA became protease-resistant (Fig. 2i), suggesting binding of iHA-100 to the HA stalk region. These results also indicated that iHA-100 protected HA from trypsin cleavage at neutral pH (Fig. 2i, compare lanes 4 and 6). We consider that iHA-100 primarily interacted with the stalk domain to interfere with the conformational change in the HA protein at neutral conditions to block the viral adsorption process. Collectively, iHA-100 inhibited the adsorption and fusion step of the influenza virus by binding to the stalk domain of HA.Efficacy of iHA-100 against lethal influenza virus infection in miceWe evaluated the in vivo efficacy of iHA-100 against influenza virus infection in a murine lethal infection model (Fig. 3). H5N1-infected mice were intranasally administered 1.9 mg/kg/day iHA-100 at 0 (3 h), 2, 4, or 6 days after infection. When the administration was started 0 days after H5N1 infection, bodyweight showed more fluctuation in mice treated with iHA-100 compared to the zanamivir-treated group. The survival rate in the iHA-100-treated group was comparable with the survival rate in the zanamivir-treated group (Fig. 3a, b). Although all mice in the zanamivir-treated group died due to severe weight loss when the administration was delayed to 4–8 days post-infection (dpi) and 6–10 dpi (Fig. 3a, b), the iHA-100-treated group exhibited slight weight loss, eventually recovered, and showed 40% survival. In both early (0–4 dpi) and delayed (4–8 dpi) administration of iHA-100, the virus-related increase in lung weight and viral replication in the lungs were significantly suppressed (Fig. 3c–f). In addition, the administration of iHA-100 prevented the progression of pneumonia (Fig. 3g). Thus, iHA-100 exhibited a high efficacy whether administered during the early phase (after 0 or 2 days) or late phase (after 4 or 6 days) of H5N1 infection.Fig. 3: Efficacy of iHA-100 against lethal influenza virus infection in mice.Five mice per group were intranasally inoculated with 5 MLD50 of A/whooper swan/Hokkaido/1/08 (H5N1) and were then intranasally administered iHA-100 (1.9 mg/kg/day) or zanamivir (3.3 mg/kg/day) at 0-4, 2-6, 4-8, or 6-10 dpi. Bodyweight and survival were monitored daily for 14 days. a Changes in body weight and b, survival rate. Results are shown as mean values, and error bars indicate SD. c–f Efficacy of early and delayed administration of iHA-100. H5N1-infected mice were administered iHA-100 (1.9 mg/kg/day) (closed squares) or vehicle (open triangles) at 0-4 dpi (c, e; early administration) or 4-8 dpi (d, f; delayed administration), and sacrificed at 3, 5, or 7 dpi (c, e; early administration), or 5, 7, or 9 dpi (d, f; delayed administration; 4 dpi sacrifice was performed before administration). Lung weights in iHA-100-treated mice (closed squares) or vehicle-treated mice (open triangles) with early (c) and delayed (d) administration were measured and normalized to the body weight. Virus titers in the lungs of mice with early (e) and delayed (f) administration were determined with plaque assays in MDCK cells (detection limit: 250 PFU/g lungs). Results are shown as mean values, and error bars indicate SD. g Effect of iHA-100 on H5N1-induced pathogenesis. Representative histopathologic findings with H&E staining of the lungs of infected mice given early administration (0-4 dpi) of vehicle or iHA-100 at 3 and 7 dpi are shown. Scale bar = 100 μm.Full size imageEfficacy of iHA-100 against highly pathogenic H5N1 in a non-human primate infection modelWe further evaluated the in vivo efficacy of iHA-100 against influenza virus infection in a non-human primate cynomolgus macaque infection model (Fig. 4). Cynomolgus monkeys were intratracheally, intranasally, and orally infected with a total of 3 × 106 plaque-forming units (PFU)/monkey of H5N1/Vietnam, and then were intratracheally given 3 mg/kg/day iHA-100 once daily for 5 days beginning at 2 dpi. Immediately after infection (1 and 2 dpi), all monkeys exhibited increases of 3 °C in body temperature (around 40 °C) at night (Fig. 4a, b). The high body temperature in monkeys of the vehicle-treated group continued during the experimental period (Fig. 4a), resulting in the death of ID #1627 at 4 dpi. In contrast, the body temperature in monkeys in the iHA-100-treated group (ID #1597 and #1602) returned to a normal range (within 1 °C before infection, 37.5–38.5 °C) at 5–7 dpi (Fig. 4b). Although the fever continued in ID #1605, this may have been due to suppurative inflammation of the telemetry implantation site. The effect of treatment with iHA-100 on body temperature was plotted as the total body temperature increase from day 3 to day 7 (AUC day 3–7) (Fig. 4c). The average body temperature increase in the iHA-100-treated group was lower than that in the vehicle group, except for ID #1627 because of a low body temperature attributed to a serious clinical condition. Bodyweight loss was relatively attenuated in monkeys in the iHA-100-treated group compared to the two vehicle-treated monkeys (#1627 and #1635) (Fig. 4d). Regarding pathological findings, lung weights were relatively lower in the iHA-100-treated group than in the vehicle-treated group (Fig. 4e, p = 0.062). In nasal, oral, and bronchial swabs of vehicle-treated monkeys, the virus was detected until 6 dpi. In contrast, the virus in these swabs of iHA-100-treated monkeys disappeared at 3–6 dpi (Fig. 4f, g, h). By calculating the area under the curve, the iHA-100-treated group showed significantly lower virus shedding after treatment (3–7 dpi) in nasal swabs, oral swabs, and bronchus brush (Supplementary Fig. 8). Virological analysis of autopsy lung samples at 7 dpi showed low virus titers in the lungs of two monkeys (#1605 and #1602) that were treated with iHA-100 (Fig. 4i). In contrast, the virus was detected in almost all lung lobes in vehicle-treated monkeys (Fig. 4i). Macroscopic findings of the extirpated lungs of the vehicle-treated group indicated obvious inflammatory lesions compared with the lungs of the iHA-100-treated group (Supplementary Fig. 9).Fig. 4: Evaluation of iHA-100 against influenza virus infection in a primate infection model.Cynomolgus monkeys were intratracheally, intranasally, and orally infected with a total of 3 × 106 PFU/monkey of A/Vietnam/UT3040/2004 (H5N1/Vietnam) and were then intratracheally administered 3 mg/kg/day iHA-100 once daily for 7 days from 2 dpi. a, b Body temperature changes in monkeys in the vehicle-treated group (a) and iHA-100-treated group (b). c Summations of body temperature increase after treatment (AUC day 3 to day 7).

The bar symbol means the average of the vehicle group (except for ID #1627 because of low body temperature attributed to a serious clinical condition) and the iHA-100 group. d Bodyweight change in monkeys infected with influenza virus and treated with iHA-100 (closed symbols) or vehicle (open symbols). e Weights of lungs in vehicle-treated monkeys (open symbols) or iHA-100-treated monkeys (closed symbols) were measured and normalized to body weight. f–h Nasal, oral, and bronchial swabs were collected every day from each monkey and used to determine the virus titer with TCID50. Open symbols indicate the titers of vehicle-treated monkeys. Closed symbols indicate the titers of iHA-100-treated monkeys. i Autopsies of H5N1-infected monkeys were performed 7 days after infection (the sample from #1627 was collected at 4 dpi). Each lobe of the lung was homogenized and used to determine virus titers. Results are shown as mean values and are representative of three biologically independent experiments (n = 3). j–l Comprehensive cytokine analysis of lungs removed from H5N1-infected monkeys. Each lobe of the lung was homogenized and used for the multiplex assay for 23-plex non-human primate cytokines. The six-lobe mixes (Right upper: RU, Right middle: RM, Right lower: RL, Left upper: LU, Left middle: LM and Left lower: LL) of the lung homogenates of each monkey were used for measurements, and the concentration is represented as the average of three monkeys in the vehicle (white bars)-treated or iHA-100 (black bars)-treated group. Results are shown as mean values and are representative of three biologically independent experiments. Vertical bars indicate the SD of three replicates. P values were calculated by Student’s t-test (two-sided, unpaired).Full size imageTo investigate the influence of iHA-100 on the pathology of H5N1 infection, a comprehensive analysis of cytokines was performed. Inflammatory cytokines (interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-6) in the lungs of iHA-100-treated monkeys were significantly reduced compared with vehicle-treated monkeys (Fig. 4j, k). In addition, IL-15 was also decreased in the lungs of iHA-100-administered monkeys (Fig. 4l), but other cytokines did not show significant changes (Supplementary Fig. 10). IL-15 is involved in the pathogenesis of influenza virus-induced acute lung injury19. These findings suggested that H5N1-induced inflammation and pathogenesis were suppressed by the administration of iHA-100. Thus, the results of the non-human primate cynomolgus macaque experiment support the results of the mouse experiments and are proof of concept design. We also assessed the stability of iHA-100 in serum and showed that its half-life is approximately 3.85 h (Supplementary Fig. 11). Taken together, our data suggest that iHA-100 is a candidate antiviral agent that inhibits both virus replication and pathogenesis in vivo.DiscussionHemagglutinin (HA) contributes to the binding of the influenza virus to its receptors and is known as the main target for neutralizing antibodies. However, HA shows antigenic diversity due to high-frequency mutation; therefore, the effectiveness of neutralizing antibodies targeting HA is limited to specific strains of the virus. In recent years, broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAb) that have a different mechanism of action from conventional neutralizing antibodies have been reported to inhibit the infection of a wide range of subtypes17,18. In this study, 28 HA-targeting macrocyclic peptides (iHAs) were found using the RaPID system. Of this iHAs, iHA-100 and iHA-24 effectively inhibited the in vitro replication of various Group 1 subtypes (Fig. 1d-k).One of the mechanisms of action of the antiviral effect exerted by iHA-100 is inhibition of HA-mediated membrane fusion (Fig. 2g, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6), similar to bNAb. In HA protein, the stalk domain is highly conserved among subtypes, as opposed to the globular head domain, which has diverse antigenicity. By binding to the stalk domain (Fig. 2h, and Supplementary Fig. 7), iHA-100 can inhibit HA-mediated membrane fusion of a wide range of subtype viruses, resulting in the prevention of viral entry into host cells. Recently, it has been reported that the influenza virus spreads by an alternative infection mode (cell-to-cell transmission) that does not require NA activity-dependent viral release, and thus shows NA inhibitor resistance20. Cell-to-cell transmission requires trypsin-induced HA maturation, which leads to viral entry into adjacent cells dependent on mature HA-mediated membrane fusion. Therefore, iHA-100, which has inhibitory activity against HA-mediated membrane fusion, may also inhibit the cell-to-cell transmission of influenza viruses that cannot be inhibited by conventional neutralizing antibodies and NA inhibitors20.Another mechanism of action of the antiviral effect exerted by iHA-100 is inhibition of viral adsorption to host cells (Fig. 2a). Since the globular head domain, not the stalk domain, is involved in viral adsorption (binding to the receptor), bNAbs that bind the stalk domain do not have this mechanism of action. Although iHA-100 also binds to the stalk domain like bNAbs, the exact mechanism of how it exhibits inhibition of virus adsorption is unclear at present. Intriguingly, in the presence of iHA-100, trypsin-induced cleavage of HA0 was inhibited under not only acidic conditions but also neutral conditions (Fig. 2i). This indicates that iHA-100 prevents trypsin cleavage of HA0 on the cell surface (neutral conditions). We consider that iHA-100 primarily interacts with the stalk domain to interfere with the cleavage of HA0 protein in neutral conditions to block the viral adsorption process. Alternatively, in the analysis of escape mutations against iHA-100, mutations in the stalk domain were mainly found (Fig. 2h), while a mutation in the globular head domain (E219G) was also identified (Supplementary Fig. 7c). Therefore, iHA-100 mainly binds to the stalk domain, but it might also bind to the globular head domain. The 219th residue of HA constitutes the 220-loop involved in receptor binding21 and has been reported to affect virus binding to the human receptor22. We consider that iHA-100 may inhibit the binding of HA to the receptor (virus adsorption) through binding to the globular head domain.Furthermore, iHA-100 can act on HA intracellularly even if it is applied after virus entry (Fig. 2c–f). It has been reported that HA binds to STING and INFAR1, resulting in suppression of innate immune response signaling23,24. Thus, iHA-100 can bind to intracellular HA and might inhibit interactions among HA, STING, and INFAR1, thereby canceling the HA-mediated blockade of the innate immune signal. Therefore, by targeting HA, iHA-100 can inhibit virus entry (direct inhibition of infection), and it is also expected to cancel the suppression of innate immunity mediated by HA (indirect inhibition of infection). In animal models, viral growth was significantly suppressed and the progress of pulmonary edema/pneumonia ceased in the iHA administration group (Figs. 3 and 4). Aberrant innate immune responses are considered to be a determinant of severe pathogenicity caused by influenza virus infection25. Suppression of pathogenesis as seen in the iHA-100 administration group might have been the result of iHA-mediated cancellation of innate immune response suppression caused by influenza virus infection. These effects of iHA-100 may contribute to its anti-viral effect in the late stages of influenza virus infection in vivo.This study suggests that macrocyclic peptides may be powerful molecules to target the HA stalk region and may lead to the development of broad-spectrum influenza virus inhibitors, despite the considerable difference in antigenicity among virus strains. The RaPID system can attain a broader anti-viral spectrum of macrocycles. Thus, building on this work, we expect that more potent, broad-spectrum anti-influenza macrocycles will be developed in the near future.MethodsEthics statementAll experiments using mice were approved by the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science Animal Experiment Committee and were performed in accordance with the animal experimentation guidelines of the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science. All macaque experiments were approved by the Shiga University of Medical Science Animal Experiment Committee and were performed in accordance with the Guidelines for the Husbandry and Management of Laboratory Animals of the Research Center for Animal Life Science at the Shiga University of Medical Science and with Fundamental Guidelines for Proper Conduct of Animal Experiment and Related Activities in Academic Research Institutions under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan.Viruses and cellsMadin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, non-essential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, glucose, penicillin, and streptomycin. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and the derivative HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. All cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2.Low pathogenic avian virus A/duck/Hokkaido/Vac-3/07 (H5N1; clade unclassified); highly pathogenic avian viruses A/Vietnam/UT3040/2004 (H5N1; clade 1), A/whooper swan/Mongolia/3/05 (H5N1; clade 2.2), and A/whooper swan/Hokkaido/1/08 (H5N1; clade 2.3); laboratory strains A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1), pandemic 2009 virus A/Tokyo/2619/09 (H1N1), and A/Narita/09 (H1N1); and A/Adachi/2/57 (H2N2) were used.In vitro peptide library selectionMacrocyclic peptides were selected by PeptiDream Inc. (Kanagawa, Japan). Baculovirus-derived recombinant full-length HA protein of A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1; clade 1) (PROSPEC, East Brunswick, NJ) (iHA1-24) or vaccinia virus-derived recombinant full-length HA of A/Bar-Headed goose/Qinghai Lake/1 A/05 (iHA100-103), and 2.5 equivalents of Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) were incubated in an aqueous sodium phosphate solution (pH 8.0) at ambient temperature for 1 h. Biotinylated HA was immobilized on Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). DNA templates and the codon table for peptide expression were constructed first15. For the initiation of translation, tRNAfMetCAU was charged with N-(2-chloroacetyl)-L- or D-tryptophan by flexizyme11,12,13,26 and used in the cell-free translation system at a final concentration of 50 µM. The volume of the translation system for the first selection round was 200 µL, which could generate about 4 × 1013 fusion molecules. The fusion molecules and the HA-immobilized beads were incubated in TBST (50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween20) at 4 °C for 1 h. The concentration of the immobilized protein was estimated at 250 nM in the incubation solution. The beads were washed with cold TBST three times and heated in TBST at 95 °C for 5 min. The supernatants were taken as eluates, and a fraction of the supernatant was subjected to real-time PCR for quantification of recovered fusion molecules. The remainder was used for preparative PCR. The PCR products were transcribed to generate templates for the next selection round. After five rounds of selection, in which the recovery rate of templates from the target-immobilized beads was about 50-fold higher than that from the control beads, the recovered templates were ligated to cloning plasmids (pGEM-T Easy; Promega, Madison, WI) for sequencing.Chemical synthesis of iHAsMacrocyclic peptides were synthesized by PeptiDream Inc. All chemical peptides were assembled on Peptide Synthesizer SyroI (Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden) using the standard solid-phase peptide synthesis method with a 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) protecting group for the α-amino group of the amino acids. Rink Amide resin, 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate, and Fmoc-amino acids were purchased from Novabiochem (Merck4Biosciences, Darmstadt, Germany). Piperidine, N,N-dimethylformamide, and 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone were purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). N,N-diisopropylethylamine was purchased from Watanabe Chemical Industries (Hiroshima, Japan). After the last Fmoc group was removed, six equivalents of N-hydroxysuccinimide chloroacetate dissolved in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone were added to the peptide resin and mixed for 1 h. The peptide resin was washed with dimethylformamide and dichloromethane three times each, dried, and then mixed with trifluoroacetic acid:triisopropylsilane:H2O (90:5:5, v/v/v) for 2 h. The cleaved peptide was precipitated by pouring cold tert-butyl methyl ether, washed with diethyl ether twice, and dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) so that the final concentration was about 10 mM. Six equivalents of triethylamine were added, and the mixture was stirred for 30 min at ambient temperature. The macrocyclic peptides were purified by reversed-phase chromatography with a C4 column Cosmosil AR300 5C4 (Nacalai Tesque). The purified peptides were identified by MALDI-TOF-MS measurements by using an AutoFlex II (Bruker, Billerica, MA).The negative control iHA-4sf or iHA-12sf was synthesized based on the scrambled peptide sequence of peptide iHA-4 or iHA-12 (Fig. 1a). The iHA-4sf peptide sequence is Cyclo(HLSWELYDQYGWNC)G, and the iHA-12sf peptide sequence is Cyclo(VNWKFPLEWAIRYC)G.Plaque formation assayIn some experiments (see Figure legends for details), viruses were pre-mixed with macrocyclic peptides at 37 °C for 60 min. MDCK cells in six-well plates were washed with minimum essential medium (MEM) twice, inoculated with 50–100 PFU of viruses (200 µL), and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min with rocking every 15 min. After removing the viruses, cells were washed with MEM and overlaid with agarose medium containing macrocyclic peptides selected in this study or zanamivir (GlaxoSmithKline, Middlesex, UK). After incubation of cells at 37 °C for 2–3 days, plaques were visualized with crystal violet staining and counted.Virus pull-down assayH5N1/Vac-3, H1N1/Narita, or H2N2/Adachi viruses (1 × 105 PFU each) were mixed with biotin-iHAs (final concentration 1 µM) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The virus-iHA mixtures were further incubated with NeutrAvidin-agarose (Pierce, Rockford, IL) at 4 °C for 2 h. After washing the agarose four times, eluates were subjected to RNA extraction with a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands). Viral RNAs from precipitated viruses were quantified for the M gene with the real-time thermal cycler CFX96 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and RNA-direct SYBR Green Realtime PCR Master Mix (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan)27 using primers listed in Supplementary Table 2.The effect of the biotinylated macrocyclic peptides on plaque formation due to H5N1/Vac-3 virus replication was evaluated with the plaque formation assay as described above. The negative control biotin-iHA-4sf was synthesized based on the sequence of peptide iHA-4 (Fig. 1b) and exhibited no inhibitory effect on virus replication. This negative control was composed of the scrambled peptide sequence: Cyclo(HLSWELYDQYGWNC)GG-polyethylene glycol (PEG)-Biotin.Polykaryon formation assayHEK293 cells (5 × 104 cells/well) in 48-well plates were transfected with the protein expression plasmid pCAGGS for HA from A/Vietnam/1194/04 (H5N1; clade 1), A/Indonesia/5/05 (H5N1; clade 2.1), A/Bar-Headed goose/Qinghai Lake/1 A/05 (H5N1; clade 2.2), A/Anhui/1/05 (H5N1; clade 2.3), or A/California/07/2009 (H1N1). At 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with acetylated trypsin (1 µg/mL) in MEM containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 30 min to cleave the HA into its HA1 and HA2 subunits and then treated with low pH buffer (MEM containing 20 mM sodium citrate (pH 5.0)) for 2 min at 37 °C. Cells were further incubated in a complete medium containing various concentrations of iHA-100 (0.01, 0.1, or 1 µM) at 37 °C for 6 h and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. HA expression was detected with immunofluorescence staining with anti-HA rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Clones Pep10-(DAAEQTRLYQNPTTYISVG)-#11 for H5 and Pep20-(YSKKFKPEIAIRC)-#20 for H1 HA; prepared in our laboratory) and Alexa Fluor-488-conjugated secondary antibodies (Life Technologies). Nuclei were counterstained with TO-PRO-3 Iodide (Life Technologies). Cells were observed under a confocal laser microscope (FV300; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). For quantification of the polykaryon formation efficiency, numbers of nuclei in five randomly chosen fields were divided by counterparts of the HA-expressing cells. Percentage (%) of polykaryon formation was normalized to the no treatment (NT) control.RBC fusion assayH5N1/Vac-3 or H1N1/pdm2619 virus (1 × 107 PFU each) was incubated with chicken RBCs (final concentration 2%) on ice for 10 min. Dilutions of iHA-24 were added to the virus-RBC mixtures and incubated on ice for 30 min. The pH of the mixture was then reduced to 5.0 by adding sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.6), followed by further incubation at 37 °C for 60 min. After centrifugation at 3000 rpm (800×g) for 3 min, clarified supernatants were used for the determination of the NADPH concentration by measuring the optical density at 340 nm.Isolation of influenza A virus escape mutants from iHA-100Ten-fold serial dilutions of H5N1/Vac-3 and H1N1/PR8 virus (101 to 108 PFU) were mixed with iHA-100 (0.1 and 0.01 µM, respectively), and MDCK cells were inoculated with viral dilutions in a 96-well plate. After 3–4 days of incubation, the supernatants of the cytopathic effect-positive wells that were infected with the highest dilutions of virus (H5N1/Vac-3: 106 PFU and H1N1/PR8: 104 PFU) were subjected to plaque purification in six-well plates in a medium containing iHA-100 (0.1 and 0.01 µM). Ten virus clones each derived from H5N1/Vac-3 and H1N1/PR8 were selected for amplification in 10-cm dishes in a medium containing iHA-100 (0.1 µM). RNAs were extracted from the two plaque-purified viruses with the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method and subjected to reverse transcription using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies) for the influenza viral genome (all eight genes). The cDNAs for the HA gene were amplified with PCR and subjected to DNA sequencing using the BigDye Terminator 3.1 reagent and 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Life Technologies) using primers listed in Supplementary Table 2.Surface plasmon resonance (SPR)All SPR experiments were performed with the Biacore X100 Plus Package (Cytiva, Tokyo, Japan) at 25 °C28. His-tagged HA was immobilized on a Sensor Chip NTA (Cytiva) activated by Ni2+. iHA-100, dissolved in DMSO, was diluted in running buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, 0.05% surfactant P20, and 2% DMSO). Binding constants were obtained from a series of injections of iHA-100 from 0.1 nM to 100 nM with a flow rate of 30 μL/min. Data from single-cycle kinetics were analyzed by BIAevaluation. The reference sensorgrams were subtracted from the experimental sensorgrams to produce curves representing specific binding, followed by background subtraction. Binding kinetics was evaluated using a 1:1 binding model to obtain association rate constants (ka) and dissociation rate constants (kd). Binding affinity (KD) was calculated from those constants.Trypsin susceptibility assayFor the trypsin susceptibility assay, 0.5 μM HA was pre-incubated at pH 8.0 with 2.5 μM iHA-100, 1.0 μM 14A7, or 1.0 μM CR6261 for 30 min at room temperature18. 14A7 is an HA head binding antibody produced in-house29. CR6261 is an HA stalk binding antibody that protects HA from pH-induced proteases17. Control reactions contained 2% DMSO without iHA-100. The pH of each reaction was lowered to pH 4.9 using 1 M sodium acetate buffer, while one reaction was retained at pH 8.0 to examine trypsin digestion at near-neutral pH. The reaction solutions were then thoroughly mixed by pipetting and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After incubation, the reaction solutions were neutralized to pH 8.0 with 1 M Tris-HCl buffer. Trypsin-ultra (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) was added at a final ratio of 1:50 by mass, and the samples were digested for 20 min at 37 °C. Trypsin digestion was quenched by the addition of SDS loading buffer, and samples were boiled for 3 min at 99 °C. Finally, all samples were analyzed with 4–20% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with rabbit anti-H5HA antibody (Pep-10#11, produced in-house).Murine lethal infection modelFive BALB/c female mice (8–9 weeks old) (Japan SLC, Hamamatsu, Japan) per group were anesthetized by injection of ketamine and then intranasally inoculated with 50% mouse lethal dose (5 MLD50) of H5N1/Hokkaido virus (50 µL). Mice with bodyweight loss of more than 25% of their pre-infection value were euthanized. On 14 days post-infection, mice were euthanized, and the lungs and spleen were isolated. Histopathological analysis was performed with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and virus titers in the lungs were determined with plaque assays in MDCK cells. For therapeutic treatment, H5N1/Hokkaido-infected mice were administered iHA-100 (1.9 mg/kg/day in Maintenance medium/0.4% PEG/0.4% 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPCD), 50 µL) or zanamivir (3.3 mg/kg/day in PBS, 50 µL) intranasally 3 h after infection and once daily for 4 days at 0–4, 2–6, 4–8, or 6–10 dpi. The vehicle for iHA-100 (Maintenance medium/0.4% PEG/0.4% HPCD, 50 µL) or zanamivir (PBS, 50 µL) was administered at 0–4 dpi. Bodyweights and survival of infected mice were monitored daily for 14 days. Mice with bodyweight loss of more than 25% of their pre-infection value were euthanized. On 3, 5, and 7 dpi (for early administration at 0–4 dpi) or 4, 5, 7, and 9 dpi (for delayed administration at 4–8 dpi), mice were euthanized, and the lungs and spleen were isolated. Histopathological analysis was performed with H&E staining, and virus titers in the lungs were determined with plaque assays in MDCK cells.Non-human primate infection modelThree cynomolgus monkeys (3–4 years old, female) per group were anesthetized by injection of ketamine and xylazine and then intranasally (500 µL × 2), orally (500 µL × 2), and intratracheally (2.5 mL × 2) inoculated with a total of 3 × 106 PFU of H5N1/Vietnam. The infected monkeys were administrated iHA-100 (3 mg/kg/day in Maintenance medium/0.74% PEG/0.74% HPCD) or vehicle (Maintenance medium/0.74% PEG/0.74% HPCD) intranasally (250 µL × 2), orally (250 µL × 2), and intratracheally (1 mL × 2) at 2–6 dpi. Bodyweight, body temperature, and clinical signs of infected monkeys were monitored daily for 7 days. Body temperature was monitored using telemetry. Body temperature changes of cynomolgus macaques were calculated as follows: Average temperatures of individual macaques from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. every night were calculated from the temperature recorded using a telemetry probe (TA10CTA-D70, Data Sciences International, St. Paul, MN) every 15 min (e.g., averages on day −1 indicate from 8 p.m. on day −1 to 8 a.m. on day 0 before virus inoculation, and averages on day 0 indicate from 8 p.m. on day 0 to 8 a.m. on day 1 after virus inoculation). Body temperature changes in individual macaques on each day after virus inoculation were compared with the average body temperature from day 0 before virus inoculation. Swabs were sampled from the eye, nose, oral cavity, trachea, bronchus, and rectum of each monkey. These swabs were added to the MDCK cell culture for titration of the virus. At 7 dpi, monkeys were sacrificed under ketamine and pentobarbital anesthesia, and an autopsy was performed. Histopathological analysis was performed with H&E staining, and virus titers in the lung lobes were determined by TCID50 in MDCK cells.Multiplex cytokine assayComprehensive cytokine analysis of the lungs from H5N1-infected monkeys was performed using the Milliplex Map Non-Human Primate Cytokine Magnetic Bead Panel (Millipore, PCYTMG-40K-PX23) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Each lobe (RU, RM, RL, LU, LM, and LL) of the lung from the monkey was homogenized in lysis buffer (0.01 M Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, 1% Triton-X100, 20 mM EDTA) and used in the multiplex assay for 23-plex non-human primate cytokines.Serum stability assayiHA-100 (200 µM) and internal standard peptide (20 µM) (Supplementary Fig. 11, NH2-PEG5-DWDSDTDNDDDWDSDTDNDD-PEG5-CONH2) were co-incubated in human serum (Cosmo Bio) at 37°C for 0, 1, 3, 8, 24, and 48 h. Note that the internal standard peptide is peptidase resistant, and no degradation was observed under these experimental conditions. At each time point, 15 μL of the serum mixture was added to 35 μL methanol, incubated on ice for 5 min, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm (15,300×g) at 25 °C for 3 min. The supernatant (30 µL) was mixed with 120 µL of 1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm (15,300×g) at 25 °C for 3 min. Then, 2 µL of the supernatant was analyzed with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) (Xevo G2-XS QTof system, Waters) using a reverse-phase column (ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18, 1.7 μm, 2.1 × 150 mm, Waters) with a linear gradient from 1% buffer B to 60% buffer B. Buffer B is CH3CN containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid, and buffer A is H2O containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid.Statistical analysisThe significance of differences in the viral RNA titers in pull-down assays was assessed with the Dunnett’s test and cytokine assay, lung weight and virus amout were assesed by two-tailed Student’s t-test. To evaluate differences in other assays including plaque formation and polykaryon formation, one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc comparison tests were applied. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Data availability All relevant data are available from the corresponding author on request.

The 1918-1919 pandemic was the most destructive in recorded history. It started as World War I (1914-1918) was ending and caused from 20 million to 50 million deaths - two to five times as many deaths as the war itself. When and where the pandemic began is uncertain, but because Spain experienced the first major outbreak, the disease came to be called the Spanish flu. The virus was exceptionally lethal. Many of the deaths were among young adults age 20 to 40, a group usually not severely affected by influenza. In the United States, the first reported cases surfaced at an Army camp in Kansas as World War I began winding down. In Alabama, the first cases were reported in Huntsville. The virus quickly spread and paralyzed many communities as it circled the world. If a pandemic were to hit the country today, mild projections predict 200,000 Americans and 4,000 Alabamians would die while severe estimates put the death toll at 1.9 million Americans and 29,000 Alabamians. While medical technology has come a long way in the nearly 90 years since the first flu pandemic of the 20th century, reactions to another pandemic wouldn’t be much different in 2007 than they were in 1918.

Shown here are a group of workers making face masks during the 1918 influenza epidemic. May 10, 2021 As the coronavirus pandemic spread across the country in 2020, American Red Cross volunteers joined a new project to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by making face coverings for veteran and military hospitals and military bases across the world. Similarly, more than 100 years ago, the United States found itself juggling the effects of World War I and the 1918 influenza pandemic. The Production Corps of the Red Cross, one of the most popular volunteer units in Red Cross history, manufactured and provided millions of surgical dressings and articles of clothing for soldiers, veterans and refugees during its years of operation, also making gauze face coverings to prevent the spread of influenza. THE PRODUCTION CORPS TRACES ITS ORIGINS BACK TO 1916, when the Women's Bureau of the Red Cross recruited women across the nation to make surgical dressings, hospital garments and refugee clothing for sister Red Cross societies and military hospitals in war-torn Europe. When the United States entered World War I in 1917, the program expanded to meet the needs of U.S. service members. The Army and Navy regularly requested thousands of surgical dressings and what were referred to as "comfort" items — hand-knitted socks, sweaters, soap and razors. Between 1917 and 1919, more than 8 million women, along with many Junior Red Cross members, produced over 370 million relief articles for the Allied armed forces and civilians in Europe. From 1919 to 1939, the Production Corps continued its work as a peacetime operation. Volunteers made thousands of comfort items and surgical dressings for hospitalized service men and veterans, as well as for soldiers at remote military outposts or Navy stations. In addition, these volunteers provided the same items for civilian hospitals and disaster relief responses. DURING WORLD WAR II, THE PRODUCTION CORPS WAS THE MOST POPULAR UNIT with more than 3.5 million members spread across more than 3,000 local Red Cross chapters. Unlike other volunteer jobs, there was no prerequisite training, and recruitment and task assignments were accomplished quickly. The women, and in some cases men, who volunteered enjoyed the camaraderie. Workrooms were set up not only at chapter buildings, but also at schools, churches and other public or private facilities for their convenience. From 1939 to 1946, the volunteers of the Production Corps made: More than 63.5 million garments for civilians and the military More than 31.2 million kit bags with items like playing cards and soap Nearly 2.5 million surgical dressings More than 1.4 million infant garments IN 1950, THE RED CROSS COMBINED THE PRODUCTION CORPS with the Community Service to Camps and Hospitals — which supplied recreation equipment to the armed forces — to create the new Production and Supply Service. By the late 1960s, these services phased out: War-time demands declined, and the introduction of synthetic textiles and advances in manufacturing sterile medical supplies eliminated the need to hand-make such items. DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, RED CROSS VOLUNTEERS ALL OVER THE WORLD have sewn more than 130,000 face coverings for military installations, veterans’ hospitals and military families in need. Last year in Bahrain, women joined together to make face coverings for the U.S. military community. With the demand extending beyond Bahrain, they also shipped them out to other installations all over Europe. In Japan, the Red Cross answered the call for face coverings as well. Volunteers and employees filled requests made from the U.S. Naval Hospital in Okinawa and quarantined service members.

Here, we utilize longitudinal samples from patients hospitalized with acute influenza to understand these immune responses. We report the dynamics of 18 important immune parameters, related to clinical, genetic and virological factors, in influenza patients across different severity levels. Influenza disease correlates with increases in IL-6/IL-8/MIP-1α/β cytokines and lower antibody responses. Robust activation of circulating T follicular helper cells correlates with peak antibody-secreting cells and influenza heamaglutinin-specific memory B-cell numbers, which phenotypically differs from vaccination-induced B-cell responses. Numbers of influenza-specific CD8+ or CD4+ T cells increase early in disease and retain an activated phenotype during patient recovery. We report the characterisation of immune cellular networks underlying recovery from influenza infection which are highly relevant to other infectious diseases.

In 2017, an estimated 9.5 million people globally were hospitalized with influenza virus lower respiratory tract infections, for a total of 81.5 million days1. Moreover, an estimated 243,000–645,000 of seasonal influenza-associated respiratory deaths occur annually2. Although seasonal influenza virus infections can cause debilitating illness leading to hospitalization and death3, viral, host and immune factors determining the disease severity are unclear, as are the precise mechanisms of why some individuals present with a mild ‘asymptomatic’ infection, while others, including previously healthy or vaccinated individuals, succumb to severe viral pneumonia and fatal influenza disease. Increased susceptibility to influenza virus infection and exacerbation of disease severity can reflect an overactivation of the innate immune system, leading to hypercytokinemia, alveolar oedema and pulmonary complications, and/or impaired humoral and cellular immunity, delaying the recovery phase. While neutralizing antibodies can reduce disease transmission and viral load, the current vaccination regimens targeting antibody responses4 are often short-lived and directed against specific influenza strains, thus not protective against unpredicted influenza viruses.Based on human studies of natural and experimental influenza virus infection, it is well-established that in the absence of neutralizing antibodies, pre-existing memory CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells can reduce disease severity5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. Published evidence also associates genetic host factors, such as specific HLA types and interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with clinically poor outcomes15,16,17,18,19. The IFITM3 rs12252-C/C genotype along with early detection of inflammatory mediators IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and MIP-1β measured in the blood within 48 h of hospital admission, were associated with fatal disease outcomes in our 2013 study of hospitalized H7N9-infected patients in China (n = 18 patients, 12 recovered, 6 died)18. Association of hypercytokinemia (IL-8, MCP-1, IP-10) with fatal outcomes was first reported for the H5N1 virus20. In contrast, recovery from severe H7N9 infection was associated with lower cytokine levels and prominent CD8+ T cell responses18. Inflammatory serum cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 have also been linked to severe seasonal and pandemic influenza virus infections in hospitalized adult patients21 and predicted hospitalization in a household cohort of naturally-infected individuals, including infants, children and adults22. In critically-ill children, higher levels of blood cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IP-10, GM-CSF, MCP-1, and MIP-1α) measured within 72 h of ICU admission correlated with fatal influenza virus infection23.There is scant data on the main drivers of severe influenza resulting in hospitalization or death24,25. Previous studies of influenza-infected patient cohorts mainly focused on a very select number of immunological parameters, with only three studies combining innate (cytokines/monocytes/NK cells) and adaptive T cell immunity12,26,27, and two other studies incorporating innate immunity, T cell immunity and antibody responses10,28. The limited number of parameters measured is often due to a difficulty in obtaining longitudinal samples from acutely-infected patients combined with the amount of biological material required per assay. Only one other study, the SHIVERS report28 analyzed convalescent samples 2 weeks post-enrolment (along with one acute sample) and showed prolonged immune activation of innate and adaptive cellular responses in hospitalized patients compared to non-hospitalized patients. Thus, there is a clear deficiency in our understanding of the specific interplay between genetics, innate and adaptive immune responses driving recovery from acute viral pneumonia.Here, we utilize longitudinal samples obtained from patients hospitalized with acute influenza disease to elucidate how innate and adaptive immune responses function together to resolve influenza disease. We report, at a very high level of resolution, the overall breadth and kinetics of 18 key immune parameters: the antiviral/inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, hemagglutinin (HA)-directed antibodies, HA-probe-specific B cells, antibody-secreting cells (ASCs), circulatory CD4+ T follicular helper (cTfh) cells, influenza peptide/MHC-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, IFN-γ-producing CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) and γδ T cells, and granzymes A, B, K, M and perforin expression in CD8+, CD4+, NK and MAIT cells. This comprehensive panel of immune parameters, combined with host genetic factors and patient clinical data, enables a detailed dissection of human factors driving susceptibility, severity and recovery in patients hospitalized with seasonal influenza viruses, highly relevant to other infectious diseases, especially newly-emerging respiratory infections.ResultsPatient DISI cohortWe recruited 64 patients admitted to the Alfred Hospital (Prahran, Australia) between 2014 and 2017 into our “Dissection of Influenza-Specific Immunity” (DISI) cohort. The inclusion criteria for the DISI study included hospital admission of consenting adult patients with influenza-like illness (ILI). The longitudinal study involved serial blood and nasal swab samples collected from influenza-PCR-positive patients (influenza+, n = 44) within 1–2 days of hospital admission to discharge and follow-up blood samples ~30 days later, allowing analyses of the recovery phase (Fig. 1a). Patients who were influenza-PCR-negative (influenza-, n = 20) were included, which represented a unique set of patients with other respiratory illnesses, some caused by viral infections. The DISI cohort included one death patient in each of the influenza+ and influenza- groups (#11 and #28, respectively). The remaining cohort was admitted to the Respiratory/General Ward with one influenza+ patient requiring ICU (#62). 53 patients presented with ILI, while 6 influenza+ and 1 influenza- patient presented with pneumonia (Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Data 1).Fig. 1: Cluster analysis of patient clinical information, genetic characteristics and inflammatory cytokines.a Flow chart of study design. b Frequency of patients infected with seasonal influenza virus strains.

Overall, influenza+ patients were predominantly (55%) infected with the H3N2 influenza A virus (IAV) subtype (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1), followed by the co-circulating IAV 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1)-like strain (16%) and two co-circulating influenza B virus (IBV) strains (Phuket/3073/2013 (9%) and Brisbane/60/2008 (7%)), representing the dominant strains for each year in Australia. IAV-infected patients (median 58 yrs, n = 34) were significantly older than IBV-infected (45 yrs, n = 10) and influenza- patients (47 yrs, n = 20) (Fig. 1c). Apart from age, patient demographics in influenza+ and influenza- groups were well-matched, with 86% and 70%, respectively, having one or more high-risk conditions for severe influenza disease. Both groups had a median of 4 days in hospital (Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Data 1). Time in hospital was significantly lower for seasonal influenza+ patients compared to the more severely-ill H7N9 cohort18 with a median 14 days for recovery (n = 12, p < 0.0001, Kruskal–Wallis test) and a median of 33 days for those who died (n = 6, p = 0.0437, Kruskal–Wallis test) (Fig. 1d). The lower hospital burden reflects the lower severity of seasonal influenza compared to avian A/H7N9 disease.Cytokine clusters positively correlate with each other during influenza virus infectionHypercytokinemia of early inflammatory mediators (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, MCP-1, MIP-1α, and MIP-1β) have been associated with an increase in disease severity causing death in a number of hospitalized cohorts18,21,22,23. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines measured in the blood of acute representative influenza+ patients showed increased cytokine levels, particularly IL-6 and IL-8, between mild and moderate patients as defined by lower (0–1) or higher (2–6) sequential (sepsis-related) organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores29, respectively, and in the more severe patient requiring ICU support (Fig. 1e). Heightened IL-6 levels were also associated with the more severe 2013 H7N9-infected patients (Fig. 1e)18. After adjusting for age and the sampling time after days of disease onset, IL-6, IL-8, MIP-1α, MIP-1β and IFN-γ were significantly, strongly positively correlated with each other early after infection at V1 timepoint. This inter-correlated cytokine cluster except IFN-γ was still strongly present at convalescence, as well as the convergence of a IFN-α, IL-17 and IL-10 cluster (Fig. 1f). Therefore, our data support previous reports that IL-6, IL-8, MIP1α and MIP-1β serve as biomarkers for severe influeza disease.Antibody responses increase in magnitude and breadth at convalescenceThe annual influenza vaccine is provided for free for high-risk groups under the National Immunization Program. Despite the high proportion of influenza+ patients in this cohort being defined as high-risk due to pre-exisiting comorbidities (86%), only 48% of these patients were vaccinated against influenza prior to infection, compared to 65% of influenza- patients (Supplementary Table 1). There was rapid antigenic drifting of the H3N2 viruses between 2014 and 2017, with more annual updates of the H3-HA vaccine component compared to the less variable H1-HA and B-HA components (Supplementary Table 2). Rapid drift of the H3N2 component was evident in the viral HA-sequence analyses of nasal swabs from H3N2-infected patients with sufficient RNA. All 12 H3N2 viruses isolated from patients, including 9 who had been vaccinated, were from a different H3N2 clade when compared to the current H3N2 seasonal vaccine strain (Fig. 2a). Conversely, fewer H1-HA and B-HA sequence variations were observed between isolates from the infected patients compared to the WHO reference strains (Supplementary Fig. 1). Interestingly, despite the H3N2 clade-mismatches, all H3N2-infected patients (except one A/unsubtyped patient) generated HA inhibition (HAI) antibody titres of 40 and above (equivalent to log2(HAI/10)>2) against the H3 vaccine strain (same year as infection) at follow-up, compared to 54% at acute timepoints (Fig. 2b), suggesting a boost in strain-specific antibodies that may have contributed to the significant increase in vaccine-strain titres (p < 0.0001, Mann–Whitney test). However, only marginal increases in antibody titres were observed in H1- and B-infected patients at follow-up (Fig. 2b). Geometric mean titres (GMT) were low for all three H1, H3 and B subtypes during acute infection, but their ability to mount antibody responses at follow-up was generally comparable to vaccine-induced responses in a healthy cohort but with greater GMT fold-changes (Fig. 2c, d). As expected, antibody titres were low and remained unchanged in the influenza- group (Fig. 2c, d).Fig. 2: Viral analysis and antibody responses.a H3N2 phylogenetic tree of HA amino acid sequences from previous WHO reference strains in black, influenza vaccine strains in red and sequences isolated from the nasal swab of 12 H3N2-infected patients in blue.

Lines and shading indicate the GMT and 95% confidence intervals, respectively. Gradient colored dots indicate individual titres.Full size imagePrevious exposures to past influenza strains, influenced by age, can affect our immune responses to current influenza virus infections30. To study the breadth of antibody responses, HAI antibody landscapes were generated against current and older influenza strains from the last century that the patients may have previously encountered (Supplementary Table 2). Antibody responses to past strains were minimal during acute infection (V1 and V2) (Fig. 2e, f). However, at follow-up, influenza+ patients induced robust antibody responses to older strains from the same subtype that they were infected with, a phenomenon known as back-boosting30, but not against the other subtypes (Fig. 2e, f). Therefore, compared to the influenza- and healthy cohorts, influenza+ patients started with lower antibody titres at hospitalization, perhaps due to lower vaccine coverage, but were able to mount robust and broad antibody responses at convalescence.Activation of cTfh, ASCs and influenza-specific memory B cells prior to recoveryTfh cells are essential for generating high-affinity memory B cells in germinal centers (GCs) and are located in secondary lymphoid organs31. cTfh cells share phenotypic and functional properties to GC Tfh cells, and it has been shown that inactivated influenza vaccination (IIV) induces expansion and PD-1/ICOS-activation of CD4+CXCR5+CXCR3+ cTfh type-1 (cTfh1) cells, which correlated with antibody and CD19+CD27++CD38++ ASC responses4,32.Here, we show that activated PD-1+ICOS+ cTfh1 cells emerged within influenza-infected patients in parallel with ASC responses, both peaking between days 7 and 10 after disease onset in both influenza+ and influenza- groups, prior to patients’ recovery (Fig. 3a–d, Supplementary Fig. 2a). Activated cTfh1 cells peaked higher in influenza+ patients compared to influenza- groups, as shown by the separation of the 95% confidence intervals and individual patients’ dynamic responses (Fig. 3c-d, Supplementary Fig. 2a). The number of ASCs was significantly higher (~2–8 median fold) during acute infection compared to follow-up for both influenza+ and influenza- groups (Fig. 3e). Moreover, influenza+ patients at acute phase had higher ASC numbers than our previously described healthy cohort prior to vaccination (4.4 median fold) and at d7 post vaccination (2.6 median fold), the peak of the vaccine response. Activated cTfh1 cells were also trending higher at acute compared to follow-up (~2 fold, p = 0.0519, Mann–Whitney test, Fig. 3f). The number of activated cTfh1 cells for acute influenza+ patients was only 1.5 median fold higher compared to healthy individuals at baseline, and was slightly lower than d7 post vaccination in the healthies. This could be in part due to the patients’ lymphopenic state during acute illness where the total CD45+ lymphocyte and subset-specific cell counts were significantly lower at acute-V1 compared to follow-up, except for B cells, which explains the higher ASC numbers observed in acute patients. Cell counts were less variable in the influenza- patients and more stable in healthy donors (Supplementary Fig. 3a–c).Fig. 3: Circulating Tfh cells, ASCs and influenza-specific B cell responses.a Representative FACS plots of CD4+CXCR5+ cTfh subsets (cTfh1/2/17) and expression of activation markers PD-1 and ICOS. b Representative FACS plots of CD19+CD20-/loCD27++CD38++ ASCs and PD-1+ICOS+ activated CXCR3+CCR6– cTfh1 cells at acute (V1 and V2) and follow-up (Fup) timepoints.

Dashed line is the median baseline level for healthy controls. Statistical significance (0.0001 > p < 0.05) was determined using the two-tailed (e) Mann–Whitney test and (f) Friedman test. g–i Statistically significant p values are shown (0.0001 > p < 0.05).Full size imageNevertheless, numbers of activated cTfh1 cells in influenza+ patients were significantly higher than the cTfh2 and cTfh17 subsets, at both acute and follow-up timepoints (Fig. 3f). Further, cTfh1 responses strongly correlated with ASC responses (rs = 0.7060, p < 0.0001, Spearman test) during acute influenza virus infection, but less so for total cTfh (rs = 0.5397, p = 0.0003, Spearman test) and cTfh2 cells (rs = 0.3741, p = 0.0174, Spearman test) and no correlation with cTfh17 subsets (Fig. 3g). Whereas strong correlations were observed between acute ASC responses and total cTfh, cTfh1 and cTfh2 T cell subsets for influenza- patients (Fig. 3h). Acute ASC responses also correlated with high antibody responses (log2(HAI/10)>2 or HAI>40, Fig. 3i). However, acute cTfh responses did not significantly correlate with antibody responses, perhaps due to the low titres observed in some patients during acute infection, in contrast to a vaccination response where IIV-induced cTfh1 responses correlated with the fold-change in antibody titres (d28 over d0 baseline)4.To evaluate influenza-specific memory B cell responses during natural influenza virus infection in comparison to vaccination, recombinant HA probes relevant to the 2014-2017 vaccine strains were used to detect class-switched IgD– HA-specific B cells in influenza+ patients (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 2b). These rHA probes have been extensively validated for their specificity4,33,34. Numbers of rHA+IgD– B cells in total and per probe did not significantly change between acute and follow-up timepoints (Fig. 4b), and were comparable to the magnitudes observed following IIV4. Phenotype and isotype distributions of the total B cells remained stable between acute and follow-up timepoints (Fig. 4c, d). Specifically, rHA+IgD− B cells for H3 and B probes were more CD21loCD27hi activated memory in proportion at the acute timepoint compared to follow-up (H3: p = 0.0007, B: p = 0.0017, Tukey’s multiple comparison test), before becoming more CD21hiCD27hi resting memory at follow-up compared to acute timepoints (H3: p = 0.0004, B: p < 0.0001, Tukey’s multiple comparison test) (Fig. 3c, e top panels). Conversely, in a healthy vaccinated cohort, the resting memory phenotype was most prominent at baseline, before becoming more activated memory from days 7-28 following IIV (Fig. 3f, top panel). The isotype distribution in influenza+ patients was enriched for IgG–IgM− cells (mostly IgA+) for H3, and IgA+ cells for the B-probe at acute timepoints, before becoming largely IgG+ at follow-up for each probe (Fig. 3c, e bottom panels). In contrast, the isotype distribution of rHA+IgD− B cells did not change in healthy donors following IIV (Fig. 3f, bottom panel). Thus, our analyses show striking differences after influenza virus infection compared to vaccination of recruited rHA+IgD− B cells at both phenotypic and isotype levels.Fig. 4: Contrasting influenza-specific B cell responses between influenza infection and vaccination.a Representative FACS plots of H1-, H3- and B-specific rHA+ B cells at V1 and Fup timepoints (days after disease onset in brackets). b Numbers of total rHA+ B cells and per H1-, H3- and B-specific rHA+ B cells at acute (Ac) (n = 21) and Fup timepoints (n = 22).

Colored p values refer to each group legend within the graph.Full size imageAlthough patients’ HA-specific B cell responses did not positively correlate with their acute antibody responses which were generally low, there was a significant positive correlation between activated or resting memory HA-specific B cells with their acute ASC response, as well as resting memory HA-specific B cells with the acute cTfh responses (Supplementary Fig. 4). Taken together, we show prominent activation of cTfh1 cells during acute influenza virus infection, at the time of the ASC and influenza-specific memory B cell responses.Influenza-specific adaptive CD8+ and CD4+ T cells respond early after infectionOur previous work showed that rapid recovery from severe A/H7N9 was associated with early IFN-γ-producing CD8+ T cell responses, while late recovery involved a network of humoral (Abs) and cellular (CD8+, CD4+, NK) responses12. Here, influenza+ patients’ PBMCs were incubated with live seasonal H1N1, H3N2, B/YAM and B/VIC viruses to measure influenza-specific innate (NK, γδ, CD161+TRAV1-2+ or MAIT cells) and adaptive (CD4+ and CD8+ T cells) immune responses elicited via IFN-γ production after 18 h (Fig. 5a, b, Supplementary Fig. 5a). Kinetics of influenza-specific IFN-γ-producing cells across days after disease onset showed low numbers of IFN-γ-producing populations across all cell subsets at patients’ admission. These however increased over the course of infection, before stabilizing at convalescence (Fig. 5c). Despite lymphopenia, a fixed number of cells were added to the assay, and therefore the ability of adaptive CD8+ and CD4+ T cells to generate IFN-γ-responses, as a frequency per subset, continued to increase during acute infection until ~15 days after disease onset (Fig. 5d). Conversely, for innate cells, their ability to produce IFN-γ responses did not change, further suggesting that adaptive T cells can increasingly respond to the virus during acute infection and are the main drivers of early recovery.Fig. 5: Innate and adaptive immune responses in seasonal influenza-infected patients.a–d Data following influenza virus infection assay. a Representative FACS plots of innate (NK cells, γδ T cells and CD161+TRAV1-2+ MAIT cells) and adaptive (CD4+ and CD8+ T cells) immune cell subsets gated on live/CD14–/CD19– singlet lymphocytes. b Representative FACS plots measuring frequency of infection (intracellular nucleoprotein (NP) staining) and IFN-γ production for each immune cell subset.

Statistical significance (0.0001 > p < 0.05) was determined using two-tailed (e, f) Tukey’s multiple comparison and (g) Permutation tests.Full size imageCytolytic potential of MAIT, NK and CD8+ T cells in influenza+ patientsTo assess the cytolytic potential within the influenza+ patients’ cell subsets, we measured cytotoxic molecules: granzymes (A, B, K and M) and perforin (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Overall, MAIT cells had the highest frequency of total cytotoxic molecules expressed, followed by NK cells and CD8+ T cells, with minimal production in CD4+ T cells (Fig. 5e). However, for MAIT cells, the influenza+ patients at acute and convalescence exhibited significantly lower levels compared to healthy donors (demographics in Supplementary Table 3), but on the contrary for NK cells, possibly suggesting differences in degranulation kinetics. No differences were observed for CD8+ and CD4+ T cell subsets. Individual expression of cytolytic molecules revealed different patterns between cell subsets and cytolytic molecules (Fig. 5f). Patient NK cells had significantly higher levels of granzymes (A, B, M) and perforin compared to healthy donors, but significantly lower levels of granzyme K. Patient MAIT cells expressed lower levels of granzyme A compared to healthy donors, while patient MAIT and CD8+ T cells had lower granzyme K and perforin expression. No significant differences were observed between acute and follow-up subsets. Furthermore, co-expression of multiple cytolytic molecules (4+) was significantly reduced in influenza+ patients, both at acute and follow-up, compared to healthy individuals across all cell subsets (NK cells: acute versus healthy p = 0.0002, p < 0.0001 for all comparisons, Permutation test) (Fig. 5g), most likely reflecting their degranulation activities during influenza infection.Immune dynamics of activated memory influenza-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responsesTo dissect epitope-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells during acute IAV infection, we performed patient-specific tetramer staining, utilizing an extensive range of peptide/MHC class-I and class-II tetramers covering the most frequent HLA alleles, with an estimated population coverage of 63-100% across all ethnicities (Fig. 6a, Supplementary Table 4). Following tetramer-associated magnetic enrichment (TAME), robust tetramer+CD8+ T cell populations were detected for all donors (n = 19) and specificities tested directly ex vivo (Fig. 6b, c, Supplementary Fig. 6b, c), even when using 10–20% less cell numbers generally required for successful detection of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in healthy donors35,36,37. In 17 patients, tetramer+CD8+ T cell populations were detected at all the timepoints, while two patients had tetramer+CD8+ T cells directed toward the subdominant B7-NP epitope detectable only at follow-up. For comparison, A2-M1-tetramer+CD8+ T cells were also measured in influenza- patients (n = 4/4 detected) (Fig. 6d). Apart from CD8+ T cells, we also identified influenza-specific CD4+ T cells in 5/5 H3N2-infected patients with either HLA-DR*01:01-, DR*04:01- or DR*11:01-HA-tetramers (Fig. 6e, f), despite ~10-fold lower numbers of antigen-specific CD4+ T cells ex vivo. DR*15:02-HA tetramers were also tested but yielded no specific cells in 2/2 patients.Fig. 6: Influenza-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses.a List of influenza-specific HLA class I (A, B) and class II (DR) tetramers used in the study. b, c Concatenated FACS plots of TAME-enriched class I-tetramer+ cells gated on CD8+ T cells from influenza+ patients and (d) influenza- patients.

Statistical significance (0.0001>p<0.05) was determined using two-tailed Tukey’s multiple comparison test for (i) number of activation markers present (0, 1 or 2+) and (j) T cell differentiation subsets.Full size imageOverall, tetramer precursor frequencies (where 10−3 denotes 1 per 1000 cells or 1e-3), were stable across timepoints, with no significant differences observed between acute and follow-up (Fig. 6f). Pooled tetramer+CD8+ T cell precursor frequencies in influenza+ patients (mean ± SD, range: 2.62e-4±6.37e-4, 8.07e-7 to 3.56e-3) and influenza- patients (7.00e-5±8.11e-5, 8.38e-6 to 2.65e-4) were significantly higher 79-fold (p < 0.0001, Kruskal–Wallis test) and 21-fold (p = 0.0026, Kruskal–Wallis test), respectively, than pooled tetramer+CD4+ T cells (3.30e-6±3.20e-6, 6.19e-7 to 1.17e-5) (Supplementary Fig. 6d). Frequencies of pooled tetramer+CD8+ T cells were similar between influenza+ and influenza- patients and fell within the ranges described previously for HLA-A2+ H7N9-influenza+ patients38,39.Although the frequency of tetramer+CD8+ T cells were similar between acute and follow-up timepoints in influenza+ patients, and influenza+ versus influenza- patients, the activation phenotypes markedly differed. Based on four activation markers expressed (CD38, HLA-DR, PD-1 and CD71), higher levels of activation were detected at the acute timepoint compared to follow-up (Fig. 6g, Supplementary Fig. 6e). Notably, in influenza+ patients, expression of two or more activation markers was most evident between days 6-10 of disease onset for A2-M1+CD8+ T cells, which was in stark contrast to the mainly single-PD-1 expressing or non-activated phenotypes exhibited among the influenza+ follow-up samples, influenza- patients (Fig. 6h), and the parent CD8+ T cell populations. High levels of activation at acute compared to follow-up samples were clearly observed across all tetramer+CD8+ T cell specificities and, despite limited numbers, in tetramer+CD4+ T cells when compared to parental CD8+ and CD4+ T cell populations (Fig. 6i, Supplementary Fig. 7).Similarly, analysis of CD27/CD45RA/CD95 phenotypes showed significant differences in the activation of tetramer+ CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in influenza+ patients when compared to the parental CD8+ and CD4+ T cell populations at acute and follow-up timepoints. In general, among influenza+ patients, tetramer+CD8+ T cells consisted of central memory-like (Tcm, CD27+CD45RA–) and, to a lesser extent, effector memory-like (Tem, CD27–CD45RA–) phenotypes, while tetramer+CD4+ T cells were predominantly of Tcm-like cells. (Fig. 6j, Supplementary Fig. 6f). These proportions remained stable across timepoints but were significantly enriched in Tcm compared to the overall CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations, respectively.Overall, we show an extensive breadth of highly activated, non-cultured, ex vivo influenza-specific memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells detected during acute IAV infection, which were still present in a less activated state following recovery.Immune correlates of influenza severityWe also probed clinical, genetic and immune correlates of influenza severity and patients’ recovery. We found no significant associations between influenza disease severity (SOFA scores 0–6, clinical presentation: ILI and/or pneumonia), clinical parameters (age, sex, influenza strain, days of disease onset, days in hospital, risk factors and vaccination status) and genetic host factors (IFITM3 SNP alleles). This might be as the majority of hospitalized DISI patients were already in high-risk groups based on their comorbiditiesisk factors (86% influenza+, 70% influenza-), including chronic respiratory disease (61% influenza+, 40% influenza-). Furthermore, patients infected with seasonal influenza viruses experienced less severe disease, with short hospital stays, no requirements for mechanical ventilation, and only one patient requiring ICU for one day, in contrast to the more severe avian H7N9-infected patients18.To investigate any potential links between the overall breadth of immune responses in human influenza disease, including cytokines, antibodies, ASCs, activated cTfh1s, IFN-γ-producing innate (NK, γδT, MAIT cells) and adaptive (CD4+ and CD8+ T cells) immune cells, and key clinical/genetic parameters and SOFA scores as a measure for disease severity, we generated heat maps with all of the above mentioned parameters. Unsupervised heat maps of acute and convalescent timepoints were generated for both influenza+ (Fig. 7a, b, Supplementary Data 2 and 3) and influenza- groups, as well as the entire cohort (Supplementary Data 2–6). For influenza+ at the acute timepoints, regions of relatively lower cytokine levels of IL-6, MIP-1α, IL-8, MIP-1β, MCP-1, were linked to higher levels of functional IFN-γ-producing immune cells, ASCs and activated cTfh1s (Fig. 7a). As shown in Fig. 1f, these cytokines were strongly positively correlated to each other. At convalescence, lower cytokine regions were linked to higher IFN-γ-producing immune cells, but not ASCs or activated cTfh1 cells, which peaked during acute infection (Fig. 7b). In both acute and convalescent phases, reciprocal regions of higher cytokines levels and lower IFN-γ-producing immune cells (and lower ASCs and activated cTfh1 cells for acute) were observed. However, these observed regions were not defined specifically by SOFA scores or other clinical/genetic parameters.Fig. 7: Analyses of immune responses and clinical and genetic host factors.a,b Unsupervised heatmaps of immune, clinical and genetic parameters in influenza+ patients at (a), acute and (b), convalescent timepoints. Scale visualizes each variable using the Empirical Percentile Transformation. A value of 1 means that the measure was higher than 100% of the other samples for that measure. Each variable was transformed independently. Interactive heatmaps are shown in Supplementary Data 2–6 for influenza+, influenza- and combined datasets. Regions of low (maroon) and high (pink) cytokine clusters are boxed. c Box plots of IFN-γ-producing cells following influenza virus infection assay (n = 37), at the earliest acute (V1) and convalescent (Fup) timepoints as a function of patients’ disease severity via binned SOFA scores of 0–1 versus 2–6. Box plots represent the median (middle bar), 75% quantile (upper hinge), and 25% quantile (lower hinge), with whiskers extending 1.5 times the inter-quartile range. Nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction was used for comparisons between SOFA categories (two-tailed). Wilcoxon signed rank test (a paired test, two-tailed) was used to compare differences between V1 and Fup among the same individuals. Tests were carried out on the actual data, although plots were on a log10+1 scale for ease of visualization. Statistically significant p values are shown (0.0001>p<0.05).Full size imageBased on the functional implications of IFN-γ-producing cells detected here and our previous H7N9 study12, we analyzed specifically the numbers of IFN-γ-producing cells across acute (V1) and convalescent timepoints (Fup) as a function of patients’ disease severity via binned SOFA scores due to unequal numbers of SOFA scores across the cohort, skewing toward low (0–1) SOFA scores, classifying the least severe. At the earliest acute timepoint (V1), decreases in innate IFN-γ-producing γδT and MAIT cells were significantly associated with more severe patients with higher SOFA scores (2–6) (Fig. 7c), but not for NK cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In contrast, at convalescence, lower adaptive IFN-γ-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were associated with higher severity (Fig. 7c). These results indicated that early influenza-specific NK, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were important in driving patients’ recovery from influenza disease, and less severe patients had more robust responses at convalescence, while deficiencies in early innate γδT and MAIT cell responses impacted disease severity.DiscussionWe describe a comprehensive panel of immune cellular networks, in association with clinical and genetic characterization, underlying recovery from influenza infection, which is highly relevant to other infectious diseases. We report that the breadth of robust immune responses to influenza viruses can be measured in peripheral blood prior to patient recovery. Firstly, activated Tfh cells emerged in the blood in parallel with ASCs, both peaking between days 7 and 10 after disease onset in both influenza+ and influenza- groups, prior to patients’ recovery, which has not been described before in the blood during and following influenza virus infection. Secondly, hospitalized influenza-patients had increased IL-6, IL-8, MIP-1α/β and IFN-γ inflammatory cytokines, which strongly positively correlated with each other and were associated with lower influenza-specific responses from CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, NK cells, MAIT and γδT cells, and lower ASC and Tfh responses. This is the most extensive study covering innate cells, adaptive cells and 17 cytokines/chemokines. Thirdly, influenza-specific B cell responses positively correlated with ASC and Tfh responses, but differed to vaccination-induced B-cell responses, revealing contrasting phenotype and isotype characteristics that will inform future B cell-based vaccine designs to promote both IgG+ and IgA+ responses. Forthly, patient-specific peptide/MHC-tetramer staining captured the broadest array of epitope-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells during acute IAV infection to date in one study, by utilizing an extensive range (n = 21) of peptide/MHC class-I and class-II tetramers. These tetramers cover the most frequent HLA alleles, with an estimated population coverage of 63–100% across all ethnicities, and provide essential tools for future T cell-immune monitoring of newly-emerging influenza viruses. Lastly, lower influenza-specific γδT and MAIT cell responses were associated with more severe patients with higher SOFA scores, but not for NK cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, showing that early influenza-specific NK, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses were important in driving patients’ recovery from influenza disease.Similarly broad and early immunologic analyses of follow-up samples for both influenza+ and influenza- patients after ~30 days post-discharge have not previously been reported. Our work expands on the SHIVERS study, which included follow-up sampling with blood samples collected from mild non-hospitalized and severe hospitalized influenza-infected patients at the acute phase and at 2 weeks post-enrolment during the 2013 New Zealand winter seasons (Aug–Oct)28. The SHIVERS cohort was similar to DISI, enrolling 27 hospitalized patients predominantly infected with a H3N2 virus (83%) and 76% with an underlying condition. However, our study differed from the SHIVERS study by the more rapid enrollment following symptom onset (DISI: 4.5 ± 4.4 days (mean ± SD) compared to SHIVERS:10.7 ± 4.8 days) and our patients were hospitalized for longer (DISI median of 4 days (range 1–38 days) compared to SHIVERS median of 2 days (1–10 days). Rapid recruitment and longer hospitalization with serial sampling enabled the capture of integral immune response kinetics very early during the first week of infection, at a time critical for determining patient outcome.Our cytokine analyses showed that inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, MIP-1α, MIP-1β and IFN-γ (an inducer of IP-10) were strongly positively correlated with each other, after adjusting for age and the sampling days from disease onset, and supports previous studies on their collective role as biomarkers for influenza severity18,20,21,22,23. These cytokine correlations were still robust following recovery at the convalescenct phase, in addition to the emergence of an IFN-α, IL-17 and IL-10 cluster. Furthermore, lower expression of IL-6, IL-8, MIP-1α and MIP-1β were associated with higher IFN-γ-producing immune cells following influenza virus infection assay, as well as ASCs and activated cTfh1 cells, and vice versa.Since genetic host factors, such as specific HLA types and IFITM3 SNPs have been associated with influenza disease severity15,16,17,18,19 we compared these genetic factors between influenza+ and influenza- patients. However, given that our cohort was mainly white Australian (82% influenza+, 95% influenza-), we found no differences in the number of “universal” or “risk” alleles based on studies describing HLA-A*02:01/03:01 and HLA-B*08:01/18:01/27:05/57:01 molecules binding universally conserved influenza peptides40 versus HLA-A*24:02/68:01 types positively correlating with pH1N1 mortality15 and morbidity16. Similarly, for IFITM3 SNP analyses, the non-risk rs12252-T/T homozygous allele was observed in 91% of influenza+ patients (remaining were C/T heterozygous) and 100% of influenza- patients, whereas the risk C/C homozygous allele was absent. The rs34481144 SNP showed a higher frequency of the A/G-heterozygous allele for both groups (41% and 50%, respectively), with equal or similar proportions of the risk A/A and non-risk G/G homozygous alleles. Further analyses of influenza+ patients with the risk A/A rs34481144 SNP versus influenza+ patients with A/G-heterozygous allele and non-risk G/G homozygous alleles showed no differences in disease severity by SOFA scores (Supplementary Fig. 8).For antibody responses, HAI antibody titres were lower in influenza+ patients during acute infection compared to influenza- patients and healthy controls, but increased significantly following recovery against the infected strain and previous strains from the same subtype. It is unclear whether the SHIVERS study compared antibody responses between acute versus convalescent phase within mild non-hospitalized and severe hospitalized patient groups, although they did not observe any differences when comparing antibody responses of mild versus severe groups at both acute and convalescent timepoints28. Given that we observed back-boosting of cross-reactive antibody responses post-infection at the follow-up timepoint, we postulate that having a natural influenza virus infection, compared to a vaccine-induced response, elicits more effective cross-reactive antibody responses post viral clearance warranting further investigations.In a study to measure influenza-specific B and T cell responses following seasonal IIV in healthy individuals4, vaccine-induced antibody responses positively correlated with increases in ASCs, influenza-specific memory B cells and a subset of activated cTfh cells. Similarly, during acute influenza disease, we show prominent activation of cTfh1 cells, which correlated with ASC responses and memory influenza-specific B cells. In contrast, numbers of cTfh1 did not correlate with antibody titres at acute, follow-up or fold-change titres. Only ASC numbers positively correlated with higher acute antibody titres of 40 and above, again supporting a cut-off titre of 40 as a measure of protection. A very small subset of CXCR5+PD-1high cTfh cells in the blood have been shown to correspond to CXCR5+PD-1high germinal centre Tfh cells by sharing transcriptional and TCR repertoire profiles41,42. We analyzed CXCR5+PD-1high expression on total CD4+ T cells in a small subset of influenza+ patients and also found very low levels in the blood at both acute and follow-up timepoints (0-0.2%, Supplementary Fig. 9). This is in contrast to a more prominent population found in lymph nodes41 and tonsils42. The role of cTfh cells as surrogates to germinal center Tfh cells have been described during dengue infection43 and very recently by our group in a COVID-19 patient44. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no previous reports on human cTfh cells following natural influenza virus infection.Interestingly, phenotypic analysis of the memory influenza-specific B cell response showed contrasting profiles induced by infection versus vaccination. During acute infection, influenza-specific B cells were of an activated-memory phenotype comprising IgG and IgA isotypes but were predominantly a resting-memory IgG+ population at convalescence. Conversely, IIV induced an expansion of activated-memory influenza-specific B cells but there were no changes in the isotype distribution which were predominantly IgG+ B cells, given that the influenza vaccine is not delivered to a mucosal site. IgA+ memory B cells are able to localize in the blood and mucosal sites of inflammation such as the respiratory tract during influenza virus infection to provide a rapid immune response, while IgG+ memory B cells generally circulate throughout the body45. Therefore, in accordance with our earlier antibody findings, we suggest that future B cell-based influenza vaccines promoting cross-reactive B cell responses encompassing both activated-memory IgA+ and IgG+ subclasses may provide further protection at the site of infection.Our study utilized a whole live virus assay to measure the kinetics of influenza-specific responses in NK cells, γδ T cells and CD161+TRAV1-2+ MAIT cells (innate-like), and CD8+ and CD4+ T cells (adaptive). We observed robust and increasing proportions of adaptive CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses within the first 2 weeks of infection, despite the patients’ overall lymphphopenic state, illustrating the ability of these cell types to drive patient recovery. In contrast, innate lymphocytes did not increase in their ability to respond to influenza virus infection by cytokine production, and lower IFN-γ-producing γδ T cells and MAIT cells were significantly associated with higher disease severity based on SOFA scores at the earliest V1 timepoint. Similarly, an H7N9 study showed the robustness of the adaptive CD8+ and CD4+ T cell-immune response in driving recovery from severe H7N9 disease12. These findings have important implications for future influenza vaccines because, apart from the CD4+ T cell help compartment, IIV fails to induce CD8+ T cell responses nor any innate responses from NK cells, γδ T cells and MAIT cells, as previously reported4.We probed influenza-specific T cells ex vivo using a range of peptide/MHC class I and class II tetramers covering the most frequent HLA alleles with an estimated population coverage of 63–100% across all ethnicities. Tetramer+ CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were highly activated at acute timepoints, compared to a less activated profile at follow-up, and mainly expressed combinations of PD-1 with CD38 and CD71, and HLA-DR to a lesser extent. In contrast to severe H7N9 influenza13, Ebola46 and COVID-19 disease44, with prominent CD38+HLA-DR+ populations in the total CD8/CD4 compartments, we did not observe marked populations of CD38+HLA-DR+ T cells in either tetramer+ or parent populations, perhaps reflecting a less severe cohort of diseased patients in our DISI study. Nonetheless, we provide acute and convalescent populations of rare HA306-318-specific CD4+ T cells in H3N2-infected patients that were HLA-DR*01:01+ (n = 3), HLA-DR*04:01+ (n = 1) or HLA-DR*11:01+ (n = 1), which complements other studies assessing cells in HLA-DR*04:01+ healthy donors and rheumatoid arthritis patients following influenza vaccination47,48. Although we may have missed strong responses to rarer epitopes and HLA presenting molecules, our results represent the broadest array of influenza-specific tetramer+ T cell responses during acute influenza infection, providing essential tools for future T cell-immune monitoring of newly-emerging influenza viruses.Intriguingly, influenza-specific T cells were rarely above 1% of total CD8+ T cells in the blood and were not significantly increased during acute infection compared to the convalescence phase. This is in stark contrast to blood and lymphoid infections such as EBV and HIV-1 where blood levels can be very high (>10% for a single specificity). It is tempting to speculate that perhaps they may be migrating to the respiratory tract during acute influenza infection, although we do not have BAL samples from influenza+ patients to test this hypothesis. However, human lung cells from deceased organ donors labeled with influenza class I tetramers (HLA-A2-M158 and HLA-B57-NP199) showed high frequencies of up to 8% of influenza-specific CD8+ T cells within the memory CD45RO+CD8+ T cell population49. We speculate that perhaps these cell populations in the lung may expand to even greater numbers during acute infection. In support, an RSV infection study showed higher frequencies of RSV-specific CD8+ T cells in the BAL compared to the blood at day 10 and day 28 post-infection50. Blood RSV-specific CD8+ T cells peaked on day 10 (<0.5% of CD8+ T cells) and then contracted by day 28, whereas BAL RSV-specific CD8+ T cells continued to increase from day 10 (~1–2%) to day 28 (~10%) in the convalescence phase.There are limitations to this study. The DISI cohort included influenza+ patients who were ill enough to be admitted to hospital, thus representing a skewed population of severe influenza cases. The majority of these patients were also already at high-risk, with 86% having pre-existing comorbidities. Therefore, some findings of our study may not be applicable to the general population that experience mild influenza symptoms, have no comorbidities or are very young healthy individuals. We acknowledge that our DISI study included a small cohort (n = 65: n = 45 influenza+ and n = 20 influenza-), but we performed a comprehensive study, which included longitudinal sampling during the hospital stay and a follow-up sample at ~30 days after discharge. Although we cannot readily distinguish cause from effect, different hypotheses on the immune mechanisms underlying influenza disease severity remain. However, our DISI study provides a valuable and important body of work that provides key insights into understanding immune responses during severe influenza disease.Tracking antibody, B and T cell responses (and other immune mediators) may be predictive of patients’ severity or recovery from influenza virus infections that require hospitalization. Our current analyses of immunological and virological parameters within a clinical hospital framework provide a unique and key dataset on the mechanisms underpinning influenza severity and susceptibility in the human population. Furthermore, these efforts represent a substantial progression to elucidate the host immune responses underlying the recovery from this acute disease as well as other infectious diseases such as COVID-1944.MethodsStudy participants and designThe DISI cohort enrolled consenting adult patients admitted to The Alfred hospital during the 2014–2017 peak influenza seasons with ILI. We recruited 44 influenza-positive patients and 20 influenza-negative patients with other respiratory diseases. Bloods were collected within 24–72 h of hospital admission (Visit 1, V1), every 2–5 days until discharge (V2, V3, V4 etc), then followed up ~30 days later. Nasal swabs were collected at V1 and V2 timepoints while in hospital. Clinical data collection included vaccination status, sequential SOFA score29 as a measure of disease severity, and any significant risk factors (Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Data 1).The H7N9-infected hospitalized patient cohort (n = 18) has previously been described18. Healthy adults vaccinated in 2015 (TIV, n = 16) and 2016 (QIV, n = 26) have previously been described in detail4, where blood samples were collected prior to vaccination (day -1 or 0) and on days 7, 14 and 28 following vaccination. Healthy blood donors were recruited from The University of Melbourne and Deepdene Surgery. Buffy packs were sourced from Australian Red Cross Lifeblood, respectively (Supplementary Table 3).Human experimental work was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki Principles and according to the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Code of Practice. All participants provided written informed consent prior to the study. The study was approved by the Alfred Hospital (ID #280/14) and University of Melbourne (ID #1442952.1 and #1443389.4) Human Research Ethics Committees. Up to 40 mls of DISI patient blood was collected in sodium heparin tubes (including 1 serum tube) and processed within 24 h. Up to 60 mls was collected from healthy donors and ~50–60 ml for buffy packs. PBMCs were isolated by Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) density-gradient centrifugation and cryopreserved. DNA was extracted from the granulocyte layer using a QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany, #51306) and sent to the Victorian Transplantation and Immunogenetics Service (Australian Red Cross Lifeblood, West Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) for HLA class I and class II molecular typing using the Luminex platform and microsphere technology (One Lambda, Canoga Park, CA, USA), with LABType SSO HLA typing kits (One Lambda, #RSSO1E47, #RSSO2345). Nasal swab samples were kept cold during transport and stored at −80 °C within 4 h.In cases where fewer than the total number of donors were analyzed (Supplementary Data 7), DISI patients were selected for influenza-specific cellular assays based on their influenza status and remaining sample availability, such as the class I and II TAME experiments which were carried out on IAV+ patients and relied on HLA type and tetramer availability. HIV-positive patients (n = 5, Supplementary Data 1) were not included in such experiments to fulfil biocontainment regulations. No other blinding or randomization protocols were applied and no outliers (i.e., the two death patients) were excluded.IFITM3 SNP analysisAmplification and sequencing of exon 1 rs12252 region were performed by PCR on genomic DNA using IFITM3 forward and reverse primers (Supplementary Table 5) with Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen, #201209)51. Amplification of the rs34481144 promotor region was performed using the same forward and reverse primers but with the Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix with HF Buffer (New England Biolabs, #M0531S), and were sequenced with a different forward and reverse primer17. All primers are listed in Supplementary Table 5.Cytokine analysisPatient sera or plasma was diluted 1:4 for performing cytokine bead assay (CBA) using the Human CBA Kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, California, USA, #558265), according to manufacturer’s instructions. Capture beads included IL-2 (#558270), IL-4 (#558272), IL-6 (#558276), IL-8 (#558277), IL-10 (#558274), IL-12p70 (#558283), IL-17A (#560383), IL-1β (#558279), IFN-α (#560379), MIP-1α (#558325), MIP-1β (#558288), MCP-1 (#558287), CD178/FasL (#558330), granzyme B (#560304), RANTES (#558324), TNF (#558273) and IFN-γ (#558269). Samples were also diluted 1:100 for RANTES. Samples were acquired on a BD CantoII capturing all events. A limited panel of cytokines for H7N9 patients have already been described18.Viral sequencingThe IAV HA were sequenced by NGS using the method published before52. Briefly, virus RNA was extracted from nasal swabs or cultured virus using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, #52906). Influenza A or B multiplex RT-PCR reactions were set up using 3 µl of RNA and 3 µl of primer cocktail (Supplementary Table 5) with SuperScript III one-step RT-PCR system with Platinum Taq high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, #12574030). PCR products were further fragmented to 200 bp with Ion Xpress Plus fragment library kit (Life Technologies, #4471269) and then ligated to Ion Xpress barcode adapters 1–96 (Life Technologies, #4474517), then samples with different barcodes were pooled. AMPure XP reagent (Agencourt, #A63881) was used to clean up the library pool and quantified with the Ion library quantitation kit (Life Technologies, #4468802), 10 pM of final library concentration was used to prepare template-positive Ion Sphere particles on the Ion OneTouch 2 instrument (Life Technologies), Ion 316 Chip version 2 (Life Technologies, #4488149) was used for sequencing on the Ion Torrent PGM. FluLINE pipeline was used for data analysis to produce consensus sequence52. HA phylogenetic analysis with neighbor-joining trees were done using the Geneious 9.0.4 software (Biomatters Ltd).VirusesInfluenza A (A/H1N1/California/7/2009, A/H3N2/Switzerland/9715293/2013 and H3N2/Hong Kong/4801/2014) and B (B/YAM/Phuket/3073/2013 and B/VIC/Brisbane/60/2008) viruses were grown in 10-day old embryonated chicken eggs at 33 °C for 72 h. Allantoic fluid was harvested and titrated using standard plaque assays in MDCK cells for use in the influenza infection assays. Other viruses (Supplementary Table 2) were sourced from the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza (Melbourne, Australia).Hemagglutination inhibition assayRDE-treated sera or plasma samples were assessed for antibody titres against a panel of influenza viruses (Supplementary Table 2) using standard HAI assays with 1% turkey red blood cells (H1N1 and IBV) or 1% guinea pig red blood cells in the presence of oseltamivir (H3N2), according to WHO guidelines. HAI titres were reported as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum where hemagglutination was completely inhibited, then divided by 10 and log2-transformed.Flow cytometryFresh whole blood was used to measure absolute cell numbers using BD TruCount tubes and BD MultiTest (CD3 FITC/CD16+CD56 PE/CD45 PerCP/CD19 APC, #340500) according to manufacturer’s instructions (BD Biosciences), as well as Tfh and ASC populations as described4. Thawed PBMCs from influenza+ patients were stained with recombinant (r) HA probes from H1 (California/7/2009), H3 (Switzerland/9715293/2013 before 2016 or Hong Kong/4801/2014 since 2016) and B strains (Phuket/3073/2013 or Brisbane/60/2008)4,33, essentially as described, except anti-IgA was not included in rH1 and rH3 probe panels. PBMCs were stained with rHA probes conjugated to SA-PE and SA-APC and antibody cocktail4,33 in 150 ul of MACS buffer for 30 min on ice, washed and fixed with 1% PFA for 30 min before acquisition. PBMCs were cell surface stained in 50 ul with panels 1 and 3 (Supplementary Data 8) for 30 min on ice, fixed then permabilised and stained with intracellular antibodies from panels 1 and 3 using the BD Cytofix/Cytoperm Kit (#554714) according to manufacturer’s instructions. PBMCs were cell surface stained with panel 2 (Supplementary Data 8) following TAME as detailed below. TruCount/MultiTest samples were acquired on a BD CantoII to achieve 3000 bead events (~30,000 lymphocytes). All other samples were acquired on a BD LSRII Fortessa collecting all events. Flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo v10 software.Influenza virus infection assayThawed PBMCs (<1.5e6) from DISI influenza+ patients were cultured overnight at 37 °C/5% CO2 with their cognate live egg-grown virus (MOI = 4), essentially as described4,12, for a total of 22 h before cells were harvested, then cell surface and intracellularly stained with Panel 1a or 1b (Supplementary Data 8) using the BD Cytofix/Cytoperm Kit (#554714) according to manufacturer’s instructions. A no virus culture was included as a background staining control, which was subtracted from the virus culture. All events were collected on a BD LSRII Fortessa.Tetramer-associated magnetic enrichmentTAME was performed on thawed PBMCs (3-38e6) for the detection of influenza-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as described37,38. Peptide/MHC class I and class II monomers (Fig. 6a) were generated in-house53,54, before 8:1 molar ratio conjugation with either PE-streptavidin (SA) or APC-SA (BD Biosciences) to form tetramers. Briefly, cells were stained (1:100-200 dilution) with PE- (A2-M1, B7-NP, B8-NPs, B18-NP and B35-NPs) or APC-labelled (A1-NPs, A2-M1, A24-PB1, A68-NP, B57-NP and DR1/4/11-HAs) tetramers for 1 h at room temperature before dual-magnetic enrichment with anti-PE and anti-APC MicroBeads with LS columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Galdbach Germany) as described37,39. Tetramers restricted to the same HLA were added together at the same dilution. Unenriched, enriched and flow-through fractions were cell surface stained with Panel 2a (influenza+) or 2b (influenza-, follow-up samples only) (Supplementary Data 8) for 30 min on ice, fixed with 1% PFA, then acquired by flow cytometry. Panel 2b samples were fixed and permeabilized using the eBioscienceTM Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA, #00-5523-00). Samples with cell events just below 10, especially for tetramer+CD4+ T cells, were not further characterized phenotypically using these staining panels. All events were collected on a BD LSRII Fortessa.Expression of cytolyic moleculesFlow-through fractions of DISI patients following TAME or thawed PBMCs from healthy donors (Supplementary Table 3) were stained with Panel 3 (Supplementary Data 8) for measuring granzymes (A, B, K and M) and perforin using the Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set. All events were collected on a BD LSRII Fortessa.Statistical analysesStatistical significance was assessed using GraphPad Prism v8 software unless stated otherwise. Mann–Whitney (unpaired) and Wilcoxin (paired) tests were two-tailed. Friedman (matched) and Kruskal–Wallis (unmatched) tests were used to compare more than two groups. Tukey’s multiple comparison test compared row means between more than two groups. Partial correlation plots (Fig. 1f) showing significant (FDR-adjusted p value < 0.05) colored squares were partialed to account for the variance caused by log10(age) and the sampling days after disease onset. To build antibody landscapes (Fig. 2f), local regression (LOESS) was applied in R 3.5.355. LOESS with 95% confidence intervals was also used to plot Figs. 3c, 5c and 5d. Linear relationships between day of sample and percent of IFN-γ producing cells were assessed with ordinary least squares (lm function) in R with 95% confidence intervals shaded in gray and correlation coefficients (r2) reported in Fig. 5d. Correlations (Fig. 3g-i, Supplementary Fig. 4) were assessed using Spearman’s correlation coefficient (rs). Polyfunctionality pie charts (Fig. 5g) were generated using Pestle v1.8 and Spice v5 software56 and p values were calculated using Permutation Test. P values lower than 0.05 were considered statistically significant and exact p values are shown in the figure. All statistical tests are indicated in the figure legends.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Published today in Nature Communications, the team from the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity (Doherty Institute), Alfred Health and Monash University sought to understand which patients would recover quickly from influenza and which would become severely ill. The four-year project took samples from patients hospitalised with influenza at up to five time points during their hospital stay, and 30 days after discharge. They analysed the breadth of the immune response, enabling them to describe the specific roles of several different types of immune cells, including killer and helper T cells, B cells and innate cells. University of Melbourne Dr Oanh Nguyen, Research Fellow at the Doherty Institute, said two significant findings of the research include understanding the biomarkers that drive recovery and identifying four specific cytokines that cause serious inflammation during influenza virus infection. “Cytokines are key molecules needed for a robust immune response. However, too much of these cytokines can result in inflammation and in the case of influenza, much more serious infection,” Dr Nguyen said. “We found four specific types of cytokines that would cause severe inflammation, and this provides clinicians the ability to predict whether a patient will become really sick with influenza.” The team also consistently saw large populations of immune cells called T-follicular helper cells, working in parallel with antibody-secreting cells, in patients at around three days prior to their recovery. “These findings are the first to report the importance of T-follicular helper cells during acute influenza virus infection, following previous discoveries from our work and others on the key role of these immune cells after influenza vaccination. Signs of these cells could be used as a biomarker for recovery from influenza,” Dr Nguyen said. Professor Allen Cheng, Director of Infection Prevention and Healthcare Epidemiology at Alfred Health and Professor of Infectious Diseases Epidemiology at Monash University, said this had been a great collaboration between clinicians and world-renowned immunologists, and a good example of ‘bedside to bench’ science. “The COVID-19 pandemic, and before this, the swine flu pandemic, has highlighted the importance of improving our understanding of respiratory viral infections to improve the identification of patients at risk of severe outcomes and potentially future treatments,” Professor Cheng said. University of Melbourne Professor Katherine Kedzierska, Laboratory Head at the Doherty Institute and world-leading influenza immunologist, said this research laid the groundwork for her team’s understanding of how the immune system responds to COVID-19. “Because of our years of experience, experimental set up, knowledge and collaborations with Alfred Health for this and other influenza studies, we had the speed and agility to apply our work to immune studies of COVID-19,” Professor Kedzierska said. “This influenza study was the blueprint for our COVID-19 research.” News Archive 2024 January February March April May June July August September October November 2023 January February March April May June July August September October November December 2022 January February March April May June July August September October November December 2021 January February March April May June July August September October November December 2020 January February March April May June July August September October November December 2019 January February March April May June July August September October November December 2018 January February March April May June July August September October November December 2017 January February March April May June July August September October November December 2016 January February March April May June July August September October November December 2015 June July August October November December KEEP INFORMED Facebook Twitter Instagram Subscribe for the latest news, events and research For any media enquiries, please contact: Communications Team P: +61383441911 E: doherty-media@unimelb.edu.au Contact Us 792 Elizabeth Street Melbourne, 3000 Get Directions doherty-reception@unimelb.edu.au +61 3 9035 3555 Contact Us Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Keep informed Subscribe for the latest news, events and research First name Last name Email Subscribe We acknowledge the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin Nation as the traditional custodians of the land where our Institute stands.

In a typical flu season, the U.S. could see more than 200,000 lab-confirmed cases by this time of year, a tiny fraction of the true number of cases, estimated to range from 9 million to 45 million annually.Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreakScientists and public health experts say this year, Covid-19 mitigation measures, like social distancing and masking, most likely stopped flu transmission.RelatedHealthHealthCovid-19 lockdowns blocked flu in some placesBut according to scientists like Dr. Andy Pekosz, a professor of microbiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, a year without much flu could lead to a year with a whole lot of flu.“We’ve gone over a year without a significant portion of the population getting infected with flu and getting immunity because of that,” Pekosz said. “That could mean that the susceptible people in the population to flu are going to be increasing.”When someone gets the flu, they usually develop some immunity to the virus. That’s why young children and babies are often the most susceptible to getting infected, because their immune system hasn’t seen the virus yet. But since there was such little influenza circulating this year, the number of people without any prior immunity could double.“With low level population immunity, that could bring about more cases,” said Scott Hensley, a microbiologist at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. “We could see more pediatric deaths and, concurrent with that, a rise in cases within the whole community. That’s because overall population immunity is predicted to be low.”Scientists say another aspect of this unusual flu season is that there doesn’t appear to be many flu strains circulating.“It’s interesting,” Hensley said. “Typically, there’s a lot of genetic diversity of these viruses.”It’s unclear whether there are actually fewer strains circulating, or if there has just been limited sampling of the virus because there have been so few cases, meaning it may be possible other strains are out there that haven’t been detected.Which of these scenarios turns out to be the case could have a significant impact on next season’s flu vaccine, which is made yearly to protect against the most prominent virus strains circulating around the globe.Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak“Generally, we want less genetic diversity,” said Sarah Cobey, an epidemiologist and evolutionary biologist at the University of Chicago.If there are truly fewer strains circulating, then the vaccine stands a better chance of being a good match, making it more effective. In recent years one prominent strain, H3N2, has been problematic since there were so many substrains of it, making it more difficult for a vaccine to broadly protect against it, Cobey said. So far this year, few strains have been identified.But if the real issue is that there just hasn’t been enough sampling, then that could translate to the vaccine being a bad match, causing problems with protection.“Since we have had so few cases, we’re using a small number to make our choices from,” Pekosz said. “There could be strains circulating at a low number that could come to dominate. We worry about that normally in every flu season, but usually we have a much larger data set to choose from.”The World Health Organization selected the strains for the next flu vaccine in February, based on what’s been circulating around the globe. Scientists often pay particular attention to strains in the southern hemisphere, where flu season starts in June and typically peaks in August. Virus activity in that region is often a bellwether for what’s to come in the U.S.“The pattern of influenza activity in the Southern Hemisphere prepares the Northern Hemisphere for what may happen in their next season,” said Kanta Subbarao, director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza. “Often new viruses that are first noted in the Southern Hemisphere spread and become the dominant strain in the Northern Hemisphere.”Subbarao says there has been no local flu activity in the Southern Hemisphere yet, but it’s still early.Despite any concerns about effectiveness, the vaccine will still be key to preventing flu. Even if a flu shot is a poor match for circulating strains, it still gives some protection and reduces a person’s risk of hospitalization and death.“A lot of this is out of our hands,” Hensley said. “The one thing we can do is to get vaccinated. If there was ever a year to get vaccinated, this is the year to do that.”“A lot of this is out of our hands,” Hensley said. “The one thing we can do is to get vaccinated. If there was ever a year to get vaccinated, this is the year to do that.”Scientists also reassure that it’s not all doomsday scenarios. Indeed, predicting anything about flu is an unusually tough task. While the virus was isolated for the first time more than 80 years ago, scientists say there’s still a lot to learn.“What’s really challenging about influenza is that it’s fast evolving,” Cobey said, adding that it appears to mutate faster than SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. “Every year we are seeing flu viruses that have never been on this planet.”Dr. Jesse Goodman, professor of medicine and infectious disease at Georgetown University and former chief scientist at the Food and Drug Administration, said he believes the American population has learned a lot from Covid-19 and may carry on mitigation measures like frequent hand washing and even social distancing.“If some of these practices continue, it could be that things aren’t bad next year,” he said. “One question will be, how much will those habits persist?”Follow NBC HEALTH on Twitter & Facebook.

The rollout of over a dozen vaccines, with many more in the pipeline, has brought hope that the pandemic can be brought to an end and life can soon return to normal. Reduction in influenza temporary Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as lockdowns, mask-wearing, social distancing, and closure of non-essential institutions, have led to a temporary reduction in cases and deaths in most regions where they were applied. Along with the steep fall in COVID-19 cases, seasonal influenza has also shown a drastic decline during the pandemic. However, as vaccine uptake becomes more robust globally, social and business interactions are bound to increase, and the flu will come back, say researchers. As antigenic drift occurs, new strains will emerge, including potentially novel strains. This could, perhaps, lead to a new pandemic of influenza. Seasonal flu claims around 400,000 lives every year, on average, but four significant influenza pandemics have already occurred over the last century. The 1918-1919 H1N1 Spanish flu with 50 million deaths, 1957-1959 H2N2 Asian flu with 1.5 million deaths, 1968-1969 H3N2 Hong Kong flu with 1 million deaths, and 2009-2010 H1N1pdm09 swine flu with somewhere 150,000 to 575,000 deaths worldwide. Combination vaccine components Now, in new research posted to the bioRxiv* preprint server, scientists at Novavax, Inc. present a vaccine including recombinant influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antigen along with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, with saponin Matrix-M adjuvant. Both have passed independent safety tests in phase 1 trials. Quadrivalent nanoparticle influenza vaccine (qNIV) has repeatedly been shown to elicit broadly protective immunity against older and newly emerging strains, probably due to highly conserved neutralizing epitopes in the HA stem domain and rudimentary esterase domain. Both hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and microneutralizing (MN) antibodies have been elicited against both older and novel A and B strains of H3N2 and H1N1 viruses. Earlier researchers employed a recombinant insect cell production platform for the generation of nanoparticles bearing the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike stabilized in the prefusion conformation. These proteins are in the form of trimers that form rosettes by associating with polysorbate 80 (PS 80) micelles. The antibodies elicited by this vaccine were protective against the Wuhan-Hu-1-like virus USA-WA1, as well as the UK (B.1.1.7) and South African (B.1.351) variants of SARS-CoV-2. When tested in mice and two monkey models, the vaccine prevented both upper and lower respiratory tract infections after exposure to this virus. The vaccines' safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity have been established in many trials, showing it to induce a Th1-biased CD4+ T cell response. Thus, both components of this vaccine have been individually tested for safety and efficacy. Influenza virus neutralizing antibodies in hamsters immunized with qNIV/CoV2373 combination vaccine. Groups of hamsters were immunized with the combination qNIV/CoV2373 or with the component vaccines as indicated in Figure 2A. Virus neutralizing titers were determined 14 days after 1 dose and 14 days after the booster immunization (study day 28). (A, B) A/Kansas/14/2017. (C, D) A/Brisbane./02/2018.

Appeal of combination vaccine In the current study, the qNIV and spike vaccine combination was shown to retain its protective capabilities against influenza A and B, via HAI and neutralizing antibodies, while also protecting against both upper and lower respiratory infection with SARS-CoV-2. The researchers took advantage of this unique pandemic situation coupled with the data from the qNIV vaccine trial to develop this novel combination.

Protection against emerging variants In addition, the combination vaccine offers protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, which is an essential requirement in the current situation. Viruses like this one, with a ribonucleic acid (RNA) genome, are known to mutate rapidly and often, especially when faced with immune responses from host cells and organisms, and in the case of zoonoses like SARS-CoV-2, due to antigenic shift as well. The South African variant of SARS-CoV-2 has shown adaptation to immune challenges by escape mutations which enabled recurrent outbreaks among a population group supposed to have achieved population immunity. The use of nanoparticle-based spike protein allows for cryptic epitopes to be exposed, taking advantage of epitopes conserved between this variant and the prototype strain. This could include eliciting antibodies that are not obtained by natural infection. The influenza vaccine also appeared to show poor efficacy on the field, as shown by the occurrence of several seasonal outbreaks of severe influenza mainly due to A(H3N2) strains. This is apparently due to differences in the antigens when generated in the egg-based vaccines, but also due to antigenic changes in the viruses. However, the Matrix-M adjuvanted recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) trivalent nanoparticle influenza vaccine (tNIV) was recently shown to induce immunity to highly conserved epitopes with broad neutralizing capability. The use of the full-length surface HA glycoprotein allows the wild-type circulating viral sequence to be retained while simultaneously allowing cryptic epitopes to be exposed to the immune system and thus elicit polyclonal broadly neutralizing antibodies. Earlier studies showed that this formulation did improve the immune HAI response against A/H3N2 variants resulting from antigenic drift over several years, compared to the high-dose inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (IIV3-HD). What are the implications? Not only is the suppression of influenza likely to be transient, but co-infections of both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 will become more common. Influenza will often be overlooked due to the very similar symptoms of COVID-19. Admitting that the outcome of such co-infections is unknown, it is urgent to prepare for this eventuality by a combination vaccine such as this. Not only does it obviate the need for separate vaccine logistics, but it protects against current and emerging strains of both viruses.

What experts say to expect in next season's vaccineAdrianna Rodriguez | USA TODAYShow Caption Hide Caption COVID-19 symptoms versus flu symptomsWe answer the often searched question: "What are the symptoms of coronavirus versus the flu?"USA TODAYA year full of social distancing, mask wearing, hand washing and staying at home to prevent coronavirus spread rendered the 2020-2021 influenza season practically nonexistent.Public health and clinical laboratories reported 2,038 flu cases during the season from Sept. 27, 2020, to April 24, 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency estimated about 38 million people were sick with the flu during the 2019-2020 season.“It’s been an amazing year,” said Dr. John Swartzberg, a professor emeritus of infectious diseases at the University of California, Berkeley in the school of public health. “In all my years of being a flu watcher … I’ve never seen anything like this.”Though low flu incidence is unarguably a good thing, it raises questions about the upcoming flu season and what the vaccine will look like in the fall.Twice a year – once in February and once in September – the World Health Organization meets with health experts to review last season’s flu data. Together, they predict the four most common strains in the upcoming flu season and recommend what manufacturers should include in the next vaccine.This year, researchers are working with very little data, as international efforts to slow the coronavirus pandemic drastically reduced flu cases across the globe.“Normally and unfortunately, we have a wealth of data to base the next year’s flu vaccines on,” Swartzberg said. “But we don’t have a lot of that this year.”Based on the available data, the WHO recommended a flu vaccine similar to last season’s, he said, “which makes sense because a very small percentage (of people) on this planet developed immunity to last year’s strains.” In a quadrivalent vaccine – which contains four flu strains – the WHO recommended vaccine manufacturers keep two B strains and change out two A strains, said Dr. Gregg Sylvester, chief medical officer at Seqirus, a cell-based influenza vaccine manufacturer based in North Carolina.“Will they get it right? That will be hard to predict,” he said.As manufacturers ramp up production of flu vaccine, many Americans wonder what the upcoming season will bring. Health experts predict the virus will stick to its regular seasonality, appearing in early October and ending by April, lasting on average about 13 weeks.Can COVID-19 traumas make us stronger?Survivors of trauma and experts explore the chance for post-traumatic growth (PTG) from the traumas of the COVID-19 pandemic.Jasper Colt, USA TODAYThe lack of flu cases last season shouldn’t affect the upcoming flu season, Swartzberg said. The fact that many people didn’t get sick during an unusual flu season doesn’t mean their immune systems have weakened and are unprepared for a normal season.“It’s not like what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger,” he said. “We don’t need to be exposed to influenza on a regular basis and get sick to have stronger immune systems.”It’s difficult to make any other predictions about the 2021-2022 flu season, especially as the country continues to struggle with coronavirus cases, which hover around 50,000 new cases per day, according to the CDC. It's unknown whether states reopening will trigger a bad flu season, Sylvester said, “but we ought to be prepared for it.” Swartzberg hopes the pandemic has taught Americans about the importance of public health and how safety measures can be used for other viruses, not just SARS-CoV-2.“If we learned enough from this COVID pandemic, maybe everybody will always wear masks if they have a runny nose … maybe businesses will allow them to stay home and not force them to come to work,” he said. “It could really make us a lot healthier.”Follow Adrianna Rodriguez on Twitter: @AdriannaUSAT.

Itâs a small consolation, given the enormously disruptive scope of the pandemic. But itâs the focus of a new paper published in the journal Frontiers in Public Health by two Concordia researchers and their colleagues that studies the 2020 influenza figures from Canada, the United States, Australia and Brazil. The authors show there is a clear relationship between the implementation of COVID-mitigation measures such as hand-washing, masking and social distancing and the spread of the annual flu. They write that these preventive measures all but eliminated the flu in countries where it can kill tens of thousands of people a year, even as cases of COVID-19 soared. âWith the introduction of COVID-19 mitigation measures, we saw a steep decline in influenza cases in the northern hemisphere,â says Jovana Stojanovic, a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Health, Kinesiology and Applied Physiology and the lead author of the paper. âThen we also observed that as COVID-19 cases went up and down in different ways, influenza was basically annulled across both the north and south hemispheres. That speaks volumes about how contagious COVID-19 is compared to influenza.â Simon Bacon, a professor of health, kinesiology and applied physiology, co-authored the paper, along with Vincent Boucher and Kim Lavoie at UQAM as well as Jacqueline Boyle and Joanne Enticott of Monash University in Australia. For lead author Jovana Stojanovic, the research âspeaks volumes about how contagious COVID-19 is compared to influenza.â No peaks, all valleys The researchers initially had two objectives. The first involved using data from FluNet, the World Health Organizationâs influenza virological surveillance tool. They wanted to see how the epidemiological pattern of the 2019-20 influenza tracked onto the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic after the introduction of public mitigation measures were introduced in Canada, the United States, Australia and Brazil. The second was to combat the misleading statements and disinformation being circulated worldwide that COVID-19 was similar to influenza. Their graphs below clearly show the stark differences in transmissibility between the influenza and novel coronavirus. âIn the northern hemisphere, we initially had overlapping flu and COVID-19 cases,â Bacon says. âWhen we introduced basic measures like hand-washing, social distancing and wearing masks, the flu was almost totally obliterated while COVID kept going.â (Graphs originally published in Frontiers in Public Health) The researchers note that the first two graphs, looking at Canada and the United States, show significant reduction of influenza cases compared with the averages of the four previous years after mitigation efforts were introduced (indicated by the solid black line). Flu season, which usually runs from October to May, effectively ended a month earlier in Canada and almost two months earlier in the United States. Cases remained close to nil at the start of the 2020 flu season in both countries, which roughly coincided with the second COVID-19 wave. The next set of graphs, showing figures from Brazil and Australia, reveal similar figures. Flu season in the southern hemisphere lasts from May to November but in these cases, there was no traditional mid-year spike for flu, though COVID-19 was nearing its second-wave high. Flu cases remained near zero through the end of the year. Simon Bacon, Professor, Health, Kinesiology and Applied Physiology Easy steps These findings offer lessons for public health authorities as we eye a post-COVID future, Bacon explains. âWe know the flu is particularly problematic for older individuals and those with respiratory conditions and so on,â he says. âWhen we interact with people in those high-risk brackets, we should maintain some measures like handwashing, mask-wearing and social distancing. Weâre used to them now, so maintaining them moving forward is probably a good idea.â Read the cited paper: âCOVID-19 Is Not the Flu: Four Graphs From Four Countries.â Related topics Research subjects health Press Release You might also like: Psychology professor plays a key role in a new study of severe COVID-19 cases in Quebec long-term care facilities The pandemic lockdown leads to cleaner city air across Canada, Concordia paper reveals Trending Concordia launches graduate diploma to address Quebecâs licensed teacher shortage November 5, 2024 Concordia caps off Campus Sustainability Month with a slew of awards and certifications November 1, 2024 Concordia co-hosts the first major gathering focused solely on Inuit visual arts since 2011 October 25, 2024 Back to top © Concordia University About Academics Admissions Campus life Research International Careers Future students Current students Alumni & friends Parents Faculty & staff Media Sir George Williams Campus 1455 De Maisonneuve Blvd. W.

Using fear smacks of totalitarianism. It’s not an ethical stance for any modern government. By nature I am an optimistic person, but all this has given me a more pessimistic view of people.”Mr Morgan spoke to author Laura Dodsworth, who has spent a year investigating the Government’s tactics for her book A State of Fear, published on Monday.Ministers have faced repeated accusations that they ramped up the threat from the pandemic to justify lockdowns and coerce the public into abiding by them – a claim that will be examined by the forthcoming public inquiry into the pandemic response. Ministers have been accused of ramping up the threat from the pandemic to justify lockdowns Credit: Andrew Matthews/PA SPI-B is one of the sub-committees that advises the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), led by Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser.One SPI-B scientist told Ms Dodsworth: “In March [2020] the Government was very worried about compliance and they thought people wouldn’t want to be locked down. There were discussions about fear being needed to encourage compliance, and decisions were made about how to ramp up the fear. The way we have used fear is dystopian.“The use of fear has definitely been ethically questionable. It’s been like a weird experiment. Ultimately, it backfired because people became too scared.”Another SPI-B member said: “You could call psychology ‘mind control’. That’s what we do… clearly we try and go about it in a positive way, but it has been used nefariously in the past.”One warned that “people use the pandemic to grab power and drive through things that wouldn’t happen otherwise… We have to be very careful about the authoritarianism that is creeping in”.Another said: “Without a vaccine, psychology is your main weapon… Psychology has had a really good epidemic, actually.”As well as overt warnings about the danger of the virus, the Government has been accused of feeding the public a non-stop diet of bad news, such as deaths and hospitalisations, without ever putting the figures in context with news of how many people have recovered, or whether daily death tolls are above or below seasonal averages.Another member of SPI-B said they were "stunned by the weaponisation of behavioural psychology" during the pandemic, and that “psychologists didn’t seem to notice when it stopped being altruistic and became manipulative. They have too much power and it intoxicates them”.Steve Baker, the deputy chairman of the Covid Recovery Group of Tory MPs, said: “If it is true that the state took the decision to terrify the public to get compliance with rules, that raises extremely serious questions about the type of society we want to become.“If we’re being really honest, do I fear that Government policy today is playing into the roots of totalitarianism? Yes, of course it is.” Join the conversation Show comments The Telegraph values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

No pathogens other than prions have been identified to induce misfolding of PrPC into PrPSc and propagate infectious prions in infected cells. Here, we found that infection with a neurotropic influenza A virus strain (IAV/WSN) caused misfolding of PrPC into PrPSc and generated infectious prions in mouse neuroblastoma cells through a hit-and-run mechanism. The structural and biochemical characteristics of IAV/WSN-induced PrPSc were different from those of RML and 22L laboratory prions-evoked PrPSc, and the pathogenicity of IAV/WSN-induced prions were also different from that of RML and 22L prions, suggesting IAV/WSN-specific formation of PrPSc and infectious prions. Our current results may open a new avenue for the role of viral infection in misfolding of PrPC into PrPSc and formation of infectious prions.

In AD, β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides, Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42, are aggregated and neurofibrillary tangles, which consist of hyperphosphorylated tau, are intracellularly accumulated in the brain1. Misfolded α-synuclein with phosphorylated serine residues, particularly serine 129, is accumulated in the dopaminergic neurons of the midbrains’ substantia nigra in PD4. Interestingly, lines of evidence point out the possible role of viral infections in induction of the misfolding or aggregation of these proteins5,6. Human herpes virus-1 (HSV-1) infection was shown to increase the intracellular levels of Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 in human neuroblastoma and glioblastoma cultured cells7. Aβ1-42 was accumulated in the brains of mice infected with HSV-17. Infection with the highly pathogenic, neurotropic H5N1 avian influenza A virus (IAV) has also been shown to induce accumulation of phosphorylated α-synuclein in the neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta in mice8. However, the causal relationship between virus infections and induction of protein misfolding or protein aggregation needs to be further explored. Prion diseases, which include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans and scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in animals, are a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders caused by accumulation of infectious protein aggregates, or prions, in the brain9,10. Prions consist of the misfolded, amyloidogenic isoform of prion protein, designated PrPSc, which is produced through conformational conversion of the normal cellular counterpart, PrPC, a glycoprotein tethered to the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol moiety and expressed most abundantly in the brain, particularly by neurons9,10. Prions, or PrPSc aggregates, propagate through the so-called self-templating mechanism, in which PrPSc aggregates function as a template for PrPC to undergo conformational conversion into PrPSc9,10. However, it is unknown whether virus infection could also evoke the conversion of PrPC into PrPSc and the subsequent formation of infectious prions in neuronal cells.In this study, we show that infection with a neurotropic IAV strain A/WSN/33 (H1N1) (hereafter referred to as IAV/WSN) induced not only the conversion of PrPC into PrPSc but also the formation of infectious prions in cultured mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells. These results indicate that IAV/WSN infection plays a causal role in misfolding of PrPC into PrPSc and formation of infectious prions, further strengthening the role of virus infections in induction of the protein misfolding or aggregation associated with neurodegenerative diseases.ResultsIAV/WSN infection induces formation of PrPSc and infectious prions in neuroblastoma cellsTo test if the conversion of PrPC into PrPSc and the formation of infectious prion could be induced in cultured neuronal cells by virus infection, we used the neurotropic IAV strain, IAV/WSN to infect mouse PrPC-overexpressing N2a cells, termed N2aC24 cells11, at different multiplicities of infection (MOIs). Western blotting showed that N2aC24 cells express PrPC 4.1 times higher than N2a cells (Supplementary Fig. 1). No N2aC24 cells survived infection with 0.1 or 1.0 MOI of IAV/WSN (Fig. 1a). Only a small proportion of cells survived infection with 0.01 MOI of IAV/WSN (Fig. 1a). Amazingly, Western blotting using large amounts (300 μg) of total proteins showed proteinase K (PK)-resistant PrP in the surviving cells at 7 and 8 days post-infection (dpi) (Fig. 1b). No PK-resistant PrP was observed in control IAV/WSN-uninfected N2aC24 cells (Fig. 1b). Viral proteins, HA, NP, and M2, were detectable in infected cells by 8 dpi (Fig. 1b). Immunofluorescent staining with anti-PrP monoclonal antibody 132 (anti-PrP mAb132), which recognizes residues 119–127 of mouse PrP and specifically detects PrPSc under partially denatured conditions12, also showed the mAb132-positive signals in infected cells at 8 dpi (Fig. 1c). Double immunofluorescent staining revealed the mAb132-positive signals in viral protein M2-positive cells (Fig. 1d), suggesting that PrPC is converted into PrPSc-like PrP in IAV/WSN-infected cells. The surviving cells, designated as N2aC24(R1) cells, grew and were passaged with a 1:10 split in IAV/WSN-free medium. PrPSc-like PK-resistant PrP became easily detectable in N2aC24(R1) cells after passages on Western blotting even with lower amounts (30 μg) of total proteins, and their signal intensities were increased during the passages (Fig. 1e), suggesting that PrPSc-like PrP generated in N2aC24(R1) cells has a potential to propagate. No PK-resistant PrP was still observed in IAV/WSN-uninfected N2aC24 cells even after 20 passages with a 1:10 split (Fig. 1e). Viral proteins became undetectable in N2aC24(R1) cells (Fig. 1f), suggesting that persistent IAV/WSN infections is not required for maintenance of PrPSc-like PrP production in N2aC24(R1) cells. These results indicate that IAV/WSN infection could induce the conversion of PrPC into PrPSc-like PrP in N2aC24 cells. We repeated the same experiments and obtained the same results, showing that PrPC is converted into PrPSc-like PrP in N2aC24 cells after IAV/WSN infection (Fig. 2a). In total, the same results were observed in 4 independent experiments of IAV/WSN infection in N2aC24 cells. To confirm that PrPC in N2aC24(R1) cells is not mutated, we amplified the PrP-coding sequences in N2aC24 and N2aC24(R1) cells by PCR and subjected them to DNA sequence analysis. No mutations were found in the PrP-coding sequences in N2aC24(R1) cells as well as in N2aC24 cells (Supplementary Fig. 2), indicating that PrPC is not mutated in N2aC24(R1) cells. We also detected PrPSc-like PK-resistant PrP in parental N2a cells, which express mouse PrPC only at endogenous levels, at 5 passages after infection with IAV/WSN, indicating that overexpression of PrPC is not necessary for IAV/WSN infection to induce conversion of PrPC into PrPSc-like PrP (Fig. 2b).Figure 1IAV/WSN infection induces conversion of PrPC to PrPSc in N2aC24 cells.

All the mice inoculated with N2aC24(R1) cell lysate developed abnormal symptoms at 177 ± 4 (mean ± standard deviation, 10/10 inoculated mice were infected) days post-inoculation (dpi) (Fig. 3a). In contrast, none of the mice inoculated with control IAV/WSN-uninfected N2aC24 cell lysate developed any abnormal symptoms by 208 dpi (0/5 inoculated mice were infected) (Fig. 3a). Western blotting showed accumulation of PrPSc in the brains of N2aC24(R1)-inoculated, terminally ill mice, but not in control mice sacrificed at 208 dpi (Fig. 3b). Immunohistochemistry also showed the widespread accumulation of PrPSc in the brains of N2aC24(R1)-inoculated, terminally ill mice, but not in control mice sacrificed at 208 dpi (Fig. 3c). Vacuolation was also observed throughout the brain sections from N2aC24(R1)-inoculated, terminally ill mice, but not from control mice sacrificed at 208 dpi (Fig. 3d; Supplementary Fig. 3). These results show that mice inoculated with N2aC24(R1) cell lysate developed prion disease, indicating that IAV/WSN infection could also induce the formation of infectious prions in N2aC24 cells.Figure 3IAV/WSN infection induces de novo formation of infectious prions in N2aC24 cells.

No viral proteins were detectable in N2aC24 cells at 4 dpi with 0.01 MOI of IAV/WSN after treatment with the anti-sera at the time of infection (Fig. 4a), indicating that the anti-sera successfully blocked IAV/WSN infection in N2aC24 cells. PK-resistant PrP fragments were also undetectable in the cells after 5 passages (Fig. 4b). In contrast, HA viral protein was detectable in IAV/WSN-infected N2aC24 cells after treatment with control sera (Fig. 4a). PK-resistant PrP fragments were also observed in the cells after 5 passages (Fig. 4b). We also blocked IAV/WSN infection in N2aC24 cells using the anti-IAV agent oseltamivir. HA viral protein levels in infected N2aC24 cells were decreased at 4 dpi in a dose-dependent manner of the agent (Fig. 4c). Production of PrPSc was also inhibited in the cells after 5 or 10 passages in a dose-dependent manner by the agent (Fig. 4d). These results indicate that blockade of IAV/WSN infection prevented the conversion of PrPC into PrPSc in N2aC24 cells, confirming that IAV/WSN infection is essential for the conversion of PrPC into PrPSc in N2aC24 cells. These results also rule out the possibility that IAV/WSN preparations, culture media, or N2aC24 cells used in the experiments might have been accidentally contaminated with laboratory prions and therefore PrPC might have been converted into PrPSc in N2aC24 cells by the contaminating prions not by infection with IAV/WSN.Figure 4Blockage of IAV/WSN infection prevents formation of PrPSc in N2aC24 cells.

PK-untreated 15 μg proteins from each cell lysate were used for detection of total PrP and PK-treated 30 μg proteins for PrPSc. β-actin was used as an internal control. Full length blots of Western blot images are shown in Supplementary Fig. 9c, d, and 10.Full size imageIAV/WSN-evoked prions have distinct pathogenicityWe characterized the pathogenic properties of prions in N2aC24(R1) cells (hereafter referred to as N2aC24(R1) prions) by comparison with RML and 22L scrapie prions, both of which are regularly used in our laboratory. To this end, we serially inoculated brain homogenates from N2aC24(R1)-infected, terminally ill mice into ICR mice via an intracerebral route. Brain homogenates from mice infected with mouse-adapted 22L or RML prions were also similarly inoculated into ICR mice. Mice primarily and secondarily inoculated with N2aC24(R1)-infected brain homogenates showed similar incubation times of 176 ± 3 (11/11 inoculated mice were infected) and 168 ± 3 (7/7 inoculated mice were infected) days, respectively (Fig. 5a). However, these incubation times were significantly longer than those of mice inoculated with RML- and 22L-infected brain homogenates. Incubation times of mice inoculated with RML and 22L prions were 112 ± 6 (10/10 inoculated mice were infected) and 137 ± 6 (10/10 inoculated mice were infected) days, respectively (Fig. 5a). Vacuolation pattern in the brain was also different among N2aC24(R1)-, RML-, and 22L-infected, terminally ill mice. The number of vacuoles in N2aC24(R1)-infected brains were high in the thalamus and cerebellum and low in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (Fig. 5b, c). However, it was high in the cerebellum, intermediate in the thalamus, and low in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of 22L-infected mice, and intermediate in the thalamus and low in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellums of RML-infected mice (Fig. 5b, c; Supplementary Fig. 4). These results suggest that N2aC24(R1) prions have different pathogenic properties from RML and 22L laboratory prions.Figure 5Different pathological properties of prions in N2aC24(R1) cells from RML and 22L prions.

Error bars, standard deviation.Full size imageWe also structurally and biochemically investigated PrPSc in N2aC24(R1) cells by comparison with PrPSc in 22L-infected N2aC24L1-3 and RML-infected N2aC24LChm cells 11. Di-, mono-, and un-glycosylated forms of PrPSc from N2aC24(R1) cells migrated similarly to those of PrPSc in N2aC24L1-3 and N2aC24Chm cells (Fig. 6a), suggesting that PrPSc from N2aC24(R1), N2aC24L1-3, and N2aC24Chm cells have the same PK cleavage site. Indeed, the deglycosylated, PK-resistant fragment of PrPSc from N2aC24(R1) cells migrated at the same position as that of PrPSc from N2aC24L1-3 and N2aC24Chm cells (Fig. 6a). However, the ratio of di-, mono-, and un-glycosylated, PK-resistant fragments of PrPSc from N2aC24(R1) cells was different from that from N2aC24Chm cells, but similar to that from N2aC24L1-3 cells (Fig. 6b). In contrast, the Gdn-HCl concentration required to denature 50% of PrPSc, the [Gdn-HCl]1/2 value, was similar for PrPSc from N2aC24(R1) and N2aC24Chm cells (0.9 and 0.9 M, respectively), but different for PrPSc from N2aC24(R1) and N2aC24L1-3 cells (0.9 and 1.2 M, respectively) (Fig. 6c). These results suggest that PrPSc in N2aC24(R1) cells could also be structurally and biochemically different from PrPSc in N2aC24L1-3 and N2aC24Chm cells.Figure 6Different biochemical properties of PrPSc in N2aC24(R1) cells from PrPSc in RML- and 22L-infected N2aC24 cells.

Full length blots of Western blot images are shown in Supplementary Fig. 11.Full size imageDiscussionIn the present study, we identified a neurotropic IAV strain, IAV/WSN, as the first non-prion pathogen that has a potential to induce the conversion of PrPC into PrPSc and the formation of infectious prions in cultured neuroblastoma cells. These results may open a new door to exploring the role of virus infections in the conversion of PrPC into PrPSc and the formation of infectious prions in prion diseases.PrPSc was detected in viral protein M2-positive N2aC24 cells during the early period of IAV/WSN infection on immunofluorescent staining, suggesting that PrPC could be converted into PrPSc in IAV/WSN-infected N2aC24 cells themselves. Consistent with this, blockade of IAV/WSN infection in N2aC24 cells using anti-IAV/WSN sera or anti-IAV agent prevented the conversion of PrPC into PrPSc. However, after long culture of the surviving N2aC24 cells, termed N2aC24(R1) cells, viral proteins disappeared while PrPSc levels were increased in the cells, suggesting that IAV/WSN infection could induce the conversion of PrPC into PrPSc in N2aC24 cells in a hit-and-run fashion. It is thought that a critical step for PrPC to constitutively convert into PrPSc is the formation of PrPSc seeds through the oligomerization of nascently produced PrPSc molecules, and that once the PrPSc seeds are formed, PrPC is constitutively converted into PrPSc via the self-templating mechanism, where PrPC undergoes conformational conversion into PrPSc on the template of PrPSc seeds9,10. This may explain why persistent IAV/WSN infection is not required for maintenance of the conversion of PrPC into PrPSc in N2aC24(R1) cells. A similar hit-and-run mechanism has been also proposed for H5N1 avian IAV to induce the accumulation of misfolded α-synuclein in infected neurons8. In vitro protein misfolding cyclic amplification studies have shown that RNA and lipid molecules can function as cofactors for PrPC to convert into PrPSc and subsequently form infectious prions13,14. IAVs are negative-stranded, segmented, enveloped RNA viruses15. Thus, IAV/WSN-derived RNA or lipid molecules might be involved in the IAV/WSN-mediated hit-and-run conversion of PrPC into PrPSc in N2aC24 cells. Alternatively, PrPC is postulated to spontaneously convert into PrPSc at low frequency in normal neurons16. Therefore, IAV/WSN infection might increase the frequency of spontaneous conversion of PrPC into PrPSc in N2aC24 cells. We previously reported that PrPC has a protective role against lethal infection of IAV infection in mouse lungs through the octapeptide repeat (OR) region17. It might be thus interesting to investigate if the OR region is also required for IAV/WSN infection to induce conversion of PrPC into PrPSc in N2aC24 cells. No mutations in the PrP-coding sequence were detected in N2aC24(R1) cells. These results rule out the possibility that IAV/WSN infection might cause pathogenic mutations in the PrP-coding sequence, thereby inducing conversion of the mutant PrPC into PrPSc, or that a minority of N2aC24 cells already expressing mutant PrP might be selected after IAV/WSN infection.The pathogenic properties of prions in N2aC24(R1) cells were different from those of RML and 22L laboratory prions in mice, suggesting that IAV/WSN infection might produce a new type of prion strain in N2aC24 cells. The pathogenic properties of different prion strains are considered to be enciphered in the strain-specific different conformation of PrPSc18,19. Consistent with this, PrPSc molecules in N2aC24(R1) cells were biochemically and structurally different from those in RML-infected N2aC24Chm and 22L-infected N2aC24L1-3 cells. It is thus possible that IAV/WSN infection might induce the conversion of PrPC into an IAV/WSN-specific form of PrPSc, thereby conferring new pathogenic properties on prions in an IAV/WSN-specific way. According to the unified theory proposed by Weissmann, nucleic acid molecules have been suggested to be a factor contributing to strain-specific properties of prions20. It is thus interesting to investigate whether IAV/WSN-RNA molecules are involved in generation of IAV/WSN-specific form of PrPSc.Prion infections cause acquired prion diseases in infected individuals, such as variant and iatrogenic CJDs in humans and BSE in animals, through inducing the conversion of PrPC into PrPSc in the brain21. However, more than 85% cases of the diseases are sporadic in humans and their etiologies remain unknown22. Influenza-related acute neurologic complications such as seizure and encephalopathy have been reported in 1 to 4 cases per 100,00 children-years after infection with seasonal IAVs23. H5N1 avian IAV has been also shown to cause encephalitis in a child24. Epidemiological studies showed that the risk for Parkinson’s disease was 2–threefold higher in persons born during the 1918 H1N1 IAV pandemic than in those born prior to 1918 or after 192425,26. These facts suggest that IAV infection could cause neurological complications either acutely or chronically. Our current results may thus raise the future question of whether neurotropic virus infections, including neurotropic IAV infection, might cause or be associated with sporadic prion diseases. Elucidation of the mechanism of the IAV/WSN infection-evoked conversion of PrPC into PrPSc and formation of infectious prions in N2aC24 cells could be helpful for further understanding of the pathogenic mechanism of sporadic prion diseases.MethodsEthics statementThis study was approved by The Ethics Committee of Animal Care and Experimentation of Tokushima University (approval no. T27-102). Animals were cared for in accordance with The Guiding Principle for Animal Care and Experimentation of Tokushima University and with Japanese Law for Animal Welfare and Care. This study was carried out in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines. All experiments in this study were performed under biosafety level 2 conditions.AntibodiesThe antibodies used in this study are: 6D11 mouse anti-PrP Ab (SIG-399810; BioLegend, San Diego, CA), anti-influenza-HA Abs (GTX127357; GeneTex, Irvine, CA), anti-influenza-NP Abs (GTX125989; GeneTex), anti-influenza-M2 Abs (GTX125951; GeneTex), mouse anti-ß-actin Ab (A1978; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked Ab (NA931; GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, England), anti-rabbit IgG HRP-linked Ab (NA934; GE Healthcare), Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG Abs (A11001; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL), and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG Abs (A11012; Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Horiuchi, Hokkaido University), N2aC24, N2aC24L1-3, and N2aC24Chm cells11 were maintained at 37˚C with 5% CO2 in air in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (D-MEM) (043–30,085; Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) supplemented with 1 × Penicillin–Streptomycin Mixed Solution (26,253–84; Nakalai Tesque, Osaka, Japan), which 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin, and with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (10,437–028; Gibco, Rockford, IL). Cells were split at 10- to 15-fold dilution every 4 to 5 days by dissociation in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (11,482–15; Nakalai Tesque, Osaka, Japan) containing 2.5 g/L trypsin and 1 mM EDTA (32,777–15; Nakalai Tesque). Crl:CD1(ICR) and C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories Japan (Kanagawa, Japan).Virus preparationInfluenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus was prepared as described previously17.Determination of virus titersAliquots from the serially tenfold diluted virus solutions were inoculated into Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) (CCL-34, ATCC) in a 96-well plate. After 14 h of incubation at 37˚C, the cells were washed 3 times with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4˚C for 30 min. The cells were then washed 3 times with PBS, permeabilized by incubation with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS at RT for 20 min. After washing with PBS 3 times, the cells were incubated with anti-influenza-NP Abs in PBS at RT for 2 h. The cells were then washed with PBS 3 times and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG Abs in PBS at RT for 1 h. The fluorescent-positive cells were counted using an IX-71 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Infectious units (IFU)/mL were defined as the number of the positive cells in 1 mL of virus solution.Preparation of mouse serumIntranasal administration in mice with IAV/WSN (3,000 IFU/20 µL) or PBS was performed as reported previously17. At 14 days post-infection, blood was collected and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min and then at 4 °C for 14 h to make it clot. Serum was harvested by centrifugation at 1,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min in a T15A61 rotor (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) and stored in multiple aliquots at −80 °C until use.Virus infection of cellsCells were cultured in a 6-well plate at a density of 6 × 105 cells/well for 16 h, and then infected with IAV/WSN at defined multiplicities of infection (MOIs). Cell viability was indicated by the number of living cells. Mouse serum and oseltamivir (153–03,441; Wako Pure Chemical Industries) were inoculated into cells at the same time as IAV/WSN.Protease K treatmentAll procedures were carried out at 4˚C unless otherwise stated. Cells were rinsed 3 times with PBS (11,482–15; Nakalai Tesque), lysed in a lysis buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 100 mM NaCl), and then centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 5 min to remove insoluble debris. Brain homogenates were prepared as described previously27. The protein concentration in the lysate was determined with the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (23,225; Pierce, Rockford, IL) using bovine serum albumin (23,209; Pierce) as a standard and adjusted to 3 mg of protein/mL with the lysis buffer. 100 µL of the lysates were digested with 6 µg PK (final concentration, 20 µg PK/mg proteins; 165–21,043; Wako Pure Chemical Industries) at 37 °C for 30 min. For preparation of large amount of proteins, the PK-digested reaction was terminated by addition of Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (25,955–11, Nakalai Tesque) and butanol:methanol (5:1) solution. The insoluble materials were collected by centrifugation at 21,500 × g for 1 h. The resulting pellet was resuspended in a sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris–HCl [pH 6.8], containing 5% SDS, 4% ß-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, 0.04% bromophenol blue, 3 mM EDTA) and heated at 95 °C for 10 min before being subjected to Western blotting.De-glycosylation of PrPSc Deglycosylation of the PK-digested lysates was performed using peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) (P0704L; New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) as described previously27. In brief, the PK-digested lysates were denatured in the glycoprotein denaturing buffer (B1704S; New England BioLabs) at 100 °C for 10 min and then treated with PNGase F (P0704L; New England BioLabs) in a reaction buffer containing GlycoBuffer 2 (B3704S; New England BioLabs) and 1% NP-40 (B2704S; New England BioLabs) at 37 °C for 1 h. The lysates were subjected to Western blotting after treatment with SDS sample buffer at 95 °C for 10 min.Conformational stability assay of PrPSc Cell lysates were mixed with equal volumes of various concentrations from 0 to 4 M of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) solution and then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The samples were diluted to adjust the final concentration of GdnHCl to 0.2 M by addition of the lysis buffer, and digested with PK at 37 °C for 30 min. The PK treatment was terminated by addition of Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Nakalai Tesque) and butanol:methanol (5:1) solution. The insoluble materials were collected by centrifugation at 21,500 × g at 4 °C for 1 h in a T15A61 rotor. The resulting pellet was resuspended in the SDS sample buffer, heated at 95 °C for 10 min, and subjected to Western blotting.Western blottingWestern blotting was performed as described previously27. To evaluate the levels of proteins, their signals were densitometrically measured using LAS-4000 mini-chemiluminescence imaging system (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). Signal intensities were determined by Image Gauge software (Fuji Film).Immunofluorescence analysisAll manipulations were done at room temperature unless otherwise stated. Cells on coverslips (15 mm No. 1; Matsunami Glass Ind., LTD, Osaka, Japan) were washed three times with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. The cells were then washed three times with PBS, treated with 0.1 M glycine in PBS for 10 min, washed three times with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 4 min. For detection of PrPSc, the cells were washed three times with PBS and treated with 5 M guanidium thiocyanate for 10 min12. After washing three times with PBS, the cells were incubated with 5% FBS in PBS for 30 min for blocking and then with the first antibodies in 0.5% FBS in PBS at 4˚C overnight. After removal of the excess antibodies by washing with PBS three times, the cells were incubated with the secondary antibodies and 4’,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (340–07,971; Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) in PBS for 2 h. After washing three times with PBS, the coverslips were mounted with CC/Mount (K002; Diagnostic Biosystems, Pleasanton, CA). Fluorescence images were visualized using BZ-810 (Keyence, Osaka, Japan) and analyzed with BZ-800 analyzer software (Keyence).Intracerebral inoculation with cell lysates or brain homogenatesCells (approximately 7.5 × 106 cells) in a 10-cm dish were washed 3 times with PBS and harvested in 500 µL of PBS. The cells were then sonicated and passed through a 27 gauge needle several times to prepare a cell lysate inoculum. The resulting cell lysate inoculum was intracerebrally inoculated into 5- to 6-week-old male ICR mice (20 µL/mouse). 10% (wt/vol) homogenates from single brains in PBS were prepared from terminally ill male mice using a Multibeads shocker (Yasui Kikai, Osaka, Japan) and then diluted to 1% with PBS. Two 1% brain homogenates were mixed in equal amounts and then sonicated and passed through a 27 G needle several times to prepare a brain homogenate inoculum. The resulting inoculum was intracerebrally inoculated into 5- to 6-week-old male ICR mice (20 µL/mouse). Mice were diagnosed as sick when they developed more than five of the following features: emaciation, decreased locomotion, ruffled body hair, ataxic gait, kyphosis, priapism, upright tail, crossing leg, hind leg paresis, and foreleg paresis. Mice were also diagnosed as terminal when they became akinetic.ImmunohistochemistryImmunohistochemistry was performed as described previously27. In brief, 5 µm-sliced paraffin-embedded brain sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and autoclaved in 1 mM HCl at 121 °C for 5 min and washed with PBS. The sections were digested with 50 µg/mL PK in PBS at 37 °C for 30 min and treated with 3 M guanidine thiocyanate at RT for 10 min. After washing with PBS and blocking with 5% FBS in PBS at RT for 1 h, the sections were incubated with 6D11 anti-PrP mAb at RT for 2 h and washed with PBS. The sections were then treated with ImmPRESS reagent anti-mouse IgG (MP-7402; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) at RT for 1 h and washed with PBS. Signals were visualized by incubation with ImmPACT DAB peroxidase substrate (SK-4105; Vector Laboratories) at RT for 3 min and observed using BIOREVO BZ-9000 microscope (Keyence) with BZ-II analyzer software (Keyence) or BZ-810 (Keyence) with BZ-800 analyzer software (Keyence).Hematoxylin–eosin (HE) stainingHE staining was performed as described previously27. In brief, paraffin-embedded brain section were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and stained with Mayer’s hematoxylin solution (131–09,665; Wako Pure Chemical Industries) at RT for 5 min and 1% eosin Y solution (051–06,515; Wako Pure Chemical Industries) at RT for 2 min. After washing, the samples were mounted with Softmount (192–16,301; Wako Pure Chemical Industries). Images of sample were observed using BIOREVO BZ-9000 microscope (Keyence, Osaka, Japan) with BZ-II analyzer software (Keyence) or BZ-810 (Keyence) with BZ-800 analyzer software (Keyence).Vacuolation profileVacuoles in 0.1 mm2 areas of the HE-stained brain slices from mice (n = 3 in each mouse group) were counted in various brain regions, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum.DNA sequence analysisThe PrP-coding sequences in N2aC24 and N2aC24(R1) cells were amplified from the genomic DNAs purified using the Get pureDNA Kit-Cell, Tissue (GK03; Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan), by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with Phusion Hot Start II High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (F-549S; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a primer pair (5′-TCGGATCCCGTCATCATGGCGAAC-3′, underlined, initiation codon; 5′-CCTCTAGAGCTCATCCCACGATCAG-3′, underlined, stop codon). The resulting DNA fragments were cloned into a pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and subjected to DNA sequence analysis using an ABI PRISM 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA).

How RIG-I binds to viral RNA and how its activation is regulated remains unclear. Here, using IFI16 knockout cells and p204-deficient mice, we demonstrate that the DNA sensor IFI16 enhances IFN-I production to inhibit influenza A virus (IAV) replication. IFI16 positively upregulates RIG-I transcription through direct binding to and recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the RIG-I promoter. IFI16 also binds to influenza viral RNA via its HINa domain and to RIG-I protein with its PYRIN domain, thus promoting IAV-induced K63-linked polyubiquitination and RIG-I activation. Our work demonstrates that IFI16 is a positive regulator of RIG-I signalling during influenza virus infection, highlighting its role in the RIG-I-like-receptor-mediated innate immune response to IAV and other RNA viruses, and suggesting its possible exploitation to modulate the antiviral response.

A(H1N1)/pdm2009, H3N2 and influenza B (B/Yamagata or B/Victoria lineage) viruses are mainly responsible for seasonal influenza epidemics each year. Moreover, avian influenza virus remains a notable additional threat to human health, in particular the H5, H7 and H9 subtypes. Although vaccination is the most effective way to control influenza A viruses (IAVs), prediction of evolving immunogenic epitopes as well as challenges in vaccine production and distribution often limit vaccine efficacy and availability. Furthermore, mutations in antiviral-resistant IAV strains continue to be identified, including the H274Y mutation in neuraminidase (NA)1,2 and three major mutations (L26F, V27A and S31N) in the M2 protein3,4. Hence, the development of effective interventions against influenza virus infection remains an outstanding public health need. Targeting an essential host factor critical for influenza infection is a promising antiviral strategy5.Several families of pattern recognition receptors have been described, including Toll-like receptors, retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) and nucleotide-oligomerization-domain-like receptors, which are involved in the recognition of influenza viruses6,7,8. Among these, RIG-I is thought to be the most important sensor of influenza virus9; it binds the 5′ppp-RNA of the virus, leading it to undergo conformational changes and exposing its caspase activation and recruitment domains10, which is then ubiquitinated by the action of E3 ligases such as tripartite motif 25 (TRIM25)11 and RIPLET12. TRIM25 activates RIG-I through the generation of unanchored K63-linked polyubiquitin chains interacting with the caspase activation and recruitment domains13 or through the generation of anchored K63-linked polyubiquitin chains attached to K172 of RIG-I11. This process results in the interaction of RIG-I with the mitochondrial antiviral signalling (MAVS) adaptor, which leads to the subsequent activation of IRF3, IRF7 and NF-κB and thereby inducing the expression of type I interferon (IFN-I) and pro-inflammatory cytokines14. Therefore, RIG-I activation has to be tightly regulated to ensure effective virus inhibition while minimizing an excessive inflammatory response.IFN-γ-inducible protein-16 (IFI16) is a member of the pyrin and HIN domain (PYHIN)-containing protein family, which encodes a class of homologous proteins that share a 200-amino acid signature motif (HIN)15. IFI16 was first reported as a sensor of transfected and viral DNA involved in innate signalling16,17, and it functions as an innate immune sensor in eukaryotic cells18,19,20,21,22,23,24. IFI16 senses double-stranded DNA from invading DNA viruses, including herpes simplex virus 1, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and vaccinia virus21,24,25, single-stranded DNA from HIV-infected CD4+ T cells and nuclear-damaged DNA from etoposide-treated keratinocytes22,26. DNA recognition by IFI16 induces activation of the stimulator of interferon genes–TANK-binding kinase 1–interferon regulatory factor 3 (STING–TBK1–IRF3) pathway, which leads to the induction of IFN-I or the ASC–caspase 1-dependent inflammasome to produce interleukin-1β (IL-1β)21,24,26. Additionally, a role for IFI16 in RNA virus infection has been identified, whereby IFI16 transcriptionally regulates the gene expression of IFN-I in Sendai virus infection27. The murine orthologue of IFI16 (p204) is highly induced in mouse hepatitis coronavirus infection and inhibits IRF7-mediated IFN-I production28. Moreover, it was shown that IFI16 interacts with MAVS to promote the MAVS-mediated production of IFN-I that inhibits porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 2 replication29. More recently, IFI16 was found to directly bind chikungunya virus genome RNA and restrict viral replication and maturation30, which further suggests that IFI16 may play a crucial role in RNA virus infection. However, the precise role of IFI16 in influenza virus infection has not been elucidated.Here, we show that IFI16, which was identified as an influenza viral RNA-binding protein (RBP), is highly induced both in vitro and in vivo during IAV infection. We further demonstrate that IFI16 upregulates RIG-I transcription by binding its HINa domain to the RIG-I promoter, and interacts with both IAV viral RNA (vRNA) and RIG-I to promote influenza-virus-induced K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I. Collectively, these results indicate that IFI16 is a key positive regulator of RIG-I signalling in antiviral innate immune responses to influenza virus infection.ResultsIFI16 is a viral RBP involved in influenza virus infectionOwing to its RNA genome, influenza virus utilizes RBPs of both viral and host origin for its replication. To comprehensively uncover vRNA–host protein interactions, we performed affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (AP–MS) analysis of influenza vRNA complexes. The eight vRNA segments of H7N9 virus were individually transcribed and labelled with biotin in vitro and then incubated with lysates from IAV-infected THP-1 cells. vRNA complexes bound to streptavidin magnetic beads were analysed by MS (Fig. 1a). Domain-enrichment analysis of co-purified proteins for each RNA bait revealed that more than 90% of the isolated proteins harboured nucleic-acid-binding domains (Fig. 1b). We identified 70 candidate viral RBPs that could bind to no fewer than 3 baits. A high number of co-purified proteins have been reported as RBPs, such as PTBP1 (ref. 31), TRA2B32, DDX5 (ref. 33), DDX3X34 and RBBP6 (ref. 35), which indicates that our approach was effective in identifying vRNA-interacting proteins for influenza virus. The expression results demonstrated that IFI16 was most highly expressed for the duration of IAV infection (Fig. 1c), which suggests that IFI16 may play an important role in IAV infection.Fig. 1: IFI16 is induced by IAV infection and is involved in the pathogenesis of virus infection.a, Schematic representation of the vRNA pull-down assay and MS approach to identify viral RBPs in THP-1 cells. b, Protein domain types significantly enriched among the human interacting proteins with indicated vRNA baits. The value range of Q value is [0,1]. The closer Q is to zero, the more significant the enrichment. Domains with Q ≤ 0.05 are defined as domains that are significantly enriched in differentially expressed genes. c, mRNA expression levels, determined by RT–qPCR, of 70 candidate viral RBPs in THP-1 cells infected with PR8 virus at 2.0 m.o.i. RNA samplings were taken at 0, 6, 12 and 24 h.p.i. d, IFI16 protein expression in PR8-virus-infected (m.o.i. = 1). A549 cells were evaluated by western blotting at 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24 h.p.i. (β-actin detection was used as the loading control). e, Intracellular localization of IFI16 was assessed in PR8-virus-infected A549 cells at 0, 6, 12 and 18 h.p.i. by confocal microscopy. f, Quantification of the intracellular localization of IFI16 in cells as in e. The data represent the mean ± s.d. (n = 3 independent experiments). g, A549 cells were infected with PR8 virus at 0, 12 and 24 h.p.i. Whole cell lysate (WCL) was then immunoprecipitated with anti-IFI16. Bound proteins were analysed by immunoblotting with anti-acetylated lysine (Acet. Lys). h, A549 cells were pre-incubated with C-646 for 2 h, infected with PR8 virus for 1 h, washed with PBS and incubated in complete medium with or without C-646. In situ PLA assays were used to assess IFI16 acetylation with anti-IFI16 and anti-acetylated lysine antibodies at 24 h.p.i. For b, the results were assessed using parametric paired t-test (Student’s one-tailed t-test). For d–h, the data presented are representative of three independent experiments. Statistical significance in f was determined by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test.Source dataFull size imageTo determine whether IFI16 is involved in IAV replication, we first evaluated IFI16 expression in PR8-virus-infected human cells. IFI16 mRNA levels were significantly upregulated in THP-1, A549 and HEK293 cells during PR8 infection (Extended Data Fig. 1a–c). We also found that PR8 infection significantly elevated p204 expression in mice lung tissues at 1 day post infection (d.p.i.) and at 3 and 5 d.p.i. (Extended Data Fig. 1d). PR8 virus actively induced the expression of IFI16 in THP-1 (Extended Data Fig. 1e) and A549 cells (Fig. 1d). Furthermore, ultraviolet-inactivated PR8 virus did not induce IFI16 expression in A549 cells compared with live virus infection (Extended Data Fig. 1f–g). Collectively, these findings suggest that IFI16 is involved in the modulation of influenza virus infection.In uninfected cells, IFI16 was mainly localized in the nucleus, whereas PR8 infection induced an accumulation of IFI16 in the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 1e,f). Consistent with the immunostaining results, PR8 virus infection caused a build-up of IFI16 protein in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Extended Data Fig. 1g). Moreover, treatment of A549 cells with human IFN-γ or polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) induced IFI16 accumulation in the nucleus and cytoplasm (Extended Data Fig. 1i–k). It was reported that acetylation of IFI16 modulates its cellular distribution and cytoplasm translocation in DNA virus infection25,36. During IAV infection, we also detected the acetylation of IFI16 in PR8-virus-infected A549 cells at 12 and 24 hours post infection (h.p.i.) (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 1l). Additionally, we performed in situ proximity ligation assays (PLAs), and low levels of nuclear acetylated IFI16 dots were detected in uninfected A549 cells (Fig. 1h). In contrast, acetylated IFI16 dots were clearly elevated in the nucleus and cytoplasm at 24 h.p.i. (Fig. 1h). We found that the IAV-induced accumulation of IFI16 in the cytoplasm was abolished in C-646-treated cells (Extended Data Fig. 1m). Collectively, IFI16 is highly upregulated during IAV infection and its associated acetylation can confer functional modifications such as stabilization of the IFI16 protein.IFI16 inhibits IAV infection in vitro and in vivoTo determine the impact of IFI16 on influenza virus, IFI16–Flag vectors were transfected into A549 cells followed by PR8 infection at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 1. Overexpression of IFI16 significantly reduced the viral titre of PR8 at 18 h.p.i. (Fig. 2a) and reduced the expression of viral NP and M1 proteins (Fig. 2b). Increasing the amounts of transfected IFI16–Flag vectors in HEK293T-Gluc cells resulted in impaired viral replication in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2c). In addition, overexpression of IFI16 inhibited the expression of mRNA and vRNA of NP and M1 genes in A549 cells (Extended Data Fig. 2a) and of protein levels of NP at 6, 12 and 18 h.p.i. in HEK293 cells (Extended Data Fig. 2b). Conversely, when IFI16 was knocked down by short interfering RNA (siRNA) in A549 cells, there were significant increases in viral protein and titres of progeny viruses (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d). To investigate the function of endogenous IFI16 during IAV infection, IFI16+/+ and IFI16−/− A549 cells were infected with PR8 virus. Infected IFI16−/− A549 cells produced higher viral titres at 12 and 24 h.p.i. (Fig. 2d) and protein levels of viral NP and M1 at 12 and 18 h.p.i. (Fig. 2e). In a gain-of-function experiment, exogenous expression of IFI16 in IFI16−/− A549 cells effectively reduced the expression of viral NP and M1 proteins at 12 and 18 h.p.i. (Fig. 2f). Accordingly, we found that the replication of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged PR8 virus was markedly increased in IFI16−/− A549 cells compared with IFI16+/+ A549 cells (Fig. 2g). Collectively, these findings indicate that IFI16 inhibits influenza virus replication in human cells.Fig. 2: IFI16 expression inhibits IAV infection in vitro.a, A549 cells were transfected with IFI16–Flag plasmids or control for 24 h and then infected with PR8 virus at a m.o.i. of 1 for 18 h. Viral titres were measured by TCID50 assays. Data are presented as the mean ± s.e.m. and are representative of three independent experiments. b, Left: A549 cells were transfected with IFI16–Flag plasmids or control for 24 h and then infected with PR8 virus at a m.o.i. of 1, and NP and M1 proteins were detected. Right: data were quantified and shown as the ratio of NP to β-actin and M1 to β-actin. The data represent the mean ± s.e.m. (n = 3). c, HEK293T-Gluc cells were transfected with different amounts of IFI16–Flag or control, followed by infection with PR8 virus (m.o.i. = 1) for 24 h. Viral infectivity was determined. Data are presented as the mean ± s.e.m. and are representative of three independent experiments. d, Viral titres in PR8-virus-infected (m.o.i. = 1) IFI16+/+ (IFI16 WT) and IFI16−/− (IFI16 KO) A549 cells were measured by TCID50 assay. Data are presented as the mean ± s.e.m. and are representative of three independent experiments. e, Left: the NP and M1 protein expression levels in PR8-virus-infected (1 m.o.i.) IFI16+/+ and IFI16−/− A549 cells were analysed. Right: data were quantified and shown as the ratio of NP to β-actin and M1 to β-actin. The data represent the mean ± s.e.m. (n = 3). f, Left: IFI16+/+ and IFI16−/− A549 cells were transfected with IFI16–Flag plasmids or empty control for 24 h and then infected with PR8 virus at a m.o.i. of 1. NP and M1 proteins in virus-infected A549 cells were detected. Right: data were quantified and shown as the ratio of NP to β-actin and M1 to β-actin. The data represent the mean ± s.e.m. (n = 3). g, Fluorescence microscopy images of viral replication (green) in IFI16+/+ and IFI16−/− A549 cells after infection with GFP–PR8 virus for 12 h. For b and d–g, data are representative of three independent experiments. Statistical significance in a–f was determined by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test.Source dataFull size imageAdditionally, PR8-infected wild-type (WT) mice suffered significantly less weight loss than p204-deficient (p204−/−) mice, and they started to regain body weight by 8 d.p.i. (Fig. 3a). Moreover, survival rates of PR8 infected p204−/− mice were significantly poorer than infected WT mice (Fig. 3b), which suggests that control of IAV infection in vivo also requires p204. In lung tissues of p204−/− mice, PR8 virus replication at 4 and 6 d.p.i. was higher (Fig. 3c), with accompanying greater viral NP mRNA and vRNA levels (Fig. 3d), in lung tissues of p204−/− mice than in corresponding WT mice. Moreover, viral NP staining was more intense in lung sections of p204−/− mice at 5 d.p.i. than in corresponding WT mice (Fig. 3e). Notably, gross pathology and histopathology analyses revealed that lung tissues of PR8-virus-infected p204−/− mice displayed more extensive damage at 3 and 5 d.p.i. (Fig. 3f), and more severe inflammatory damage at 3 d.p.i. (Fig. 3g), than in corresponding WT mice. Accordingly, IL-6 and MCP-1 protein levels in bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) were also significantly higher in PR8-infected WT mice than those found in corresponding p204−/− mice (Fig. 3h,i). Furthermore, p204 deficiency dramatically inhibited the transcription of Ifnb, Viperin, Oas1, Isg15 and Il6 in PR8-virus-infected bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) (Fig. 3j–n). Therefore, IFI16 is required for host defence against influenza virus infection in vitro and in vivo.Fig. 3: p204-deficient mice are susceptible to IAV infection.a, WT and p204−/− mice (n = 6) were infected with 50 TCID50 of PR8 virus.

Statistical significance in a, c, d and h–n was determined by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test.Source dataFull size imageIFI16 enhances the production of IFN-I in IAV infectionDNA recognition by IFI16 induces the activation of the STING–TBK1–IRF3 pathway, which leads to the induction of IFN-I21,24,26. To investigate the mechanism of innate immune activation by IFI16, we performed transcriptomics analysis in IFI16+/+ and IFI16−/− A549 cells infected with PR8 virus for 12 h. In the Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis, ten enriched terms identified were related to antiviral responses (Fig. 4a). The number of genes associated with individual terms and enrichment probability were lower in IFI16−/− A549 cells (Fig. 4a). Sixteen IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) were exclusively upregulated in IFI16+/+ cells during IAV infection, while only 4 ISGs were upregulated in IFI16−/− A549 cells (Fig. 4b). Collectively, these results show that the induction of ISGs is reduced in the absence of IFI16. We next evaluated the function of IFI16 in the induction of IFN-I. Quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT–qPCR) analysis showed that overexpression of IFI16 enhanced PR8-virus-induced expression of IFNB, ISG15 and IL6 at 6 and 12 h.p.i. (Extended Data Fig. 3a–c). Conversely, IFI16 deficiency greatly reduced the PR8-virus-induced expression of IFNB, RIG-I, ISG56 and viperin (Fig. 4c–f) as well as IFNA4, IRF7 and CXCL5 (Extended Data Fig. 3d–f) in A549 cells. Furthermore, overexpression of IFI16 in A549 cells increased PR8-virus-induced IFN-β protein production at 12 and 18 h.p.i. in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4g), while IFI16 deficiency markedly decreased IFN-β production (Fig. 4h). These results suggest that IFI16 mediates antiviral effects through influenza-virus-induced IFN-I signalling.Fig. 4: IFI16 enhances RIG-I-mediated production of IFN-I during IAV infection.a, GO term analysis of upregulated host proteins in IAV-infected IFI16+/+ and IFI16−/− A549 cells.

IFN-I levels in supernatants were quantified using IFN bioassays at 2, 12, 18, 24 and 36 h.p.i. at 1 m.o.i. h, IFI16+/+ and IFI16−/− A549 cells were infected with PR8 virus at 1 m.o.i. IFN-I levels in supernatants were then measured by IFN bioassays at 2, 12, 18, 24 and 36 h.p.i. i, A549 cells were transfected with IFI16–Flag expression vectors or empty control for 24 h and then infected with 1 m.o.i. of PR8 virus for 0, 2, 4, 8 and 12 h. RIG-I-triggered downstream signalling molecules were evaluated using the indicated antibodies. j, RIG-I-triggered downstream signalling molecules in PR8-virus-infected IFI16+/+ and IFI16−/− A549 cells at 0, 4, 8 and 12 h.p.i. were analysed using the indicated antibodies. k, IFI16+/+ and IFI16−/− A549 cells were infected with PR8 virus at 5 m.o.i. Nuclear localization of p-IRF3 was then determined by p-IRF3 (Ser396) intracellular immunostaining for confocal microscopy. l, Quantification of nuclear localization of p-IRF3 (Ser396). For i–k, data are representative of three independent experiments. For a, the results were assessed using parametric paired t-test (Student’s one-tailed t-test). For c–h and l, data are presented as the mean ± s.d. from three independent experiments, and the significance of the results was assessed using parametric paired t-test (Student’s two-tailed t-test).Source dataFull size imageTo examine the contribution of IFI16 to RIG-I signalling, we transfected IFI16–Flag or control plasmids into A549 cells followed by infection with PR8 virus at 1 m.o.i. Overexpression of IFI16 in infected cells enhanced protein detection of RIG-I, phosphorylated TBK1 (p-TBK1), p-IRF3 and p-P65 relative to infected controls (Fig. 4i). In contrast, IFI16 deficiency in infected cells led to reduced protein detection of RIG-I, p-TBK1 and p-IRF3 compared with the IFI16+/+ group (Fig. 4j). Consistent with these results, overexpression of IFI16 in the presence of 5′ppp-RNA also increased protein detection of RIG-I, p-TBK1 and p-IRF3 (Extended Data Fig. 3g). Furthermore, exogenous expression of IFI16 in infected IFI16−/− A549 cells restored protein expression of RIG-I, p-TBK1 and p-IRF3 (Extended Data Fig. 3h). The immunofluorescence results showed that IFI16 deficiency reduced the level of p-IRF3 (Ser396) in the nucleus in PR8-virus-infected A549 cells (Fig. 4k,l). Taken together, these findings indicate that IFI16 is a potent stimulator of the IFN-I response in influenza virus infection.IFI16 transcriptionally upregulates the expression of RIG-I Overexpression of IFI16 progressively upregulated RIG-I protein expression in A549 cells in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 5a) and in a dose-dependent manner (Extended Data Fig. 4a). HEK293 cells co-transfected with IFI16–Myc and RIG-I–Flag followed by cycloheximide treatment did not exhibit evidence of RIG-I protein degradation (Extended Data Fig. 4b). Overexpression of IFI16 also increased the protein and mRNA expression of RIG-I in IFNAR1−/− A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Extended Data Fig. 4c,d). Furthermore, A549 cells transfected with IFI16–Flag vectors showed rising levels of RIG-I mRNA in a vector dose-dependent manner (Extended Data Fig. 4e) and in a progressive time-dependent manner (Fig. 5b). Consistent with the findings in A549 cells, mRNA expression of RIG-I in PR8-virus-infected lung tissues of p204-deficient mice was significantly reduced at 1 and 3 d.p.i. compared with corresponding WT mice (Extended Data Fig. 4f). Taken together, our results indicate that IFI16 upregulates RIG-I at the transcriptional level.Fig. 5: IFI16 upregulates RIG-I expression.a, RIG-I expression in IFI16–Flag overexpressing A549 cells at 0, 18, 24 and 30 h post transfection was detected by western blotting. β-actin detection was used as the loading control. b, RIG-I mRNA expression in A549 cells transfected with IFI16–Flag plasmids for 0, 12, 18 and 24 h was quantified by RT–qPCR. c Luciferase activity levels of the RIG-I reporter in HEK293 cells transfected with increasing amounts of IFI16–Flag expression vectors for 24 h.

The promoter sequence binding to IFI16 was determined by RT–qPCR. k, IFI16+/+ and IFI16−/− A549 cells were infected with PR8 virus for 0 and 12 h, followed by ChIP assay. RNA Pol II recruitment to the RIG-I promoter was assessed by RT–qPCR. Data are presented as percent input minus IgG background. l, Luciferase activity of the RIG-I promoter-luciferase reporter in HEK293 cells transfected with full-length IFI16 vectors and truncated mutant plasmids. Luciferase levels were normalized to Renilla values. Values are shown as the fold-change over the empty vector control. For a, data are representative of three independent experiments. For b–l, data are presented as the mean ± s.d. from three independent experiments. Statistical significance in b, c and e–l was determined by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test.Source dataFull size imageTo further assess the role of IFI16 in the regulation RIG-I, a luciferase reporter vector driven by the RIG-I promoter was used in transfections of HEK293 cells. The RIG-I promoter was responsive to IFI16 overexpression in a vector dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5c), which indicates that IFI16 is capable of transactivating the RIG-I promoter.To determine the minimum promoter length of RIG-I that is responsive to IFI16 induction, an extensive series of RIG-I promoter deletion constructs, each spliced to the luciferase reporter gene, was generated for co-transfections with increasing amounts of IFI16–Flag expression vectors (Fig. 5d–i). The minimum RIG-I promoter responsive to IFI16–Flag overexpression was between −371 and −360 bp in length (Fig. 5i). Furthermore, Flag antibody pull-down experiments, based on a series of biotinylated double-stranded DNA probes that spanned the minimum promoter section (Extended Data Fig. 4g), showed that only probe p2-mut4, which harboured mutations between the −371 and −360 region of the promoter, failed to bind IFI16–Flag (Extended Data Fig. 4h). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and qPCR assays, using two sets of primer pairs that target the −500 to −250 bp region of the RIG-I promoter, further demonstrated direct binding of IFI16 to the RIG-I promoter (Fig. 5j). Collectively, these results show that IFI16 is capable of binding to the RIG-I promoter to promote RIG-I transcription.Next, to determine whether IFI16 affects the recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to the RIG-I promoter, ChIP was performed with an anti-Pol II antibody on IFI16+/+ and IFI16−/− A549 cells infected with PR8 virus at 1 m.o.i. for 0 and 12 h. qPCR targeting the detection of the basal promoter site of RIG-I showed more RNA Pol II binding to the basal promoter of infected IFI16+/+ than infected IFI16−/− A549 cells (Fig. 5k), but no significant difference for the GAPDH promoter (Extended Data Fig. 4i), which suggests that during infection, IFI16 facilitates RNA Pol II recruitment to the basal promoter of RIG-I.To investigate the domain(s) in IFI16 responsible for activating RIG-I transcription, we constructed IFI16 expression mutants bearing different domain deletions (Extended Data Fig. 4j). Mutants without the HINa domain completely lost the ability to activate the RIG-I–luc reporter gene (Fig. 5l). In a separate experiment, we also found that in the absence of the HINa domain, there was no binding of IFI16 to a biotinylated RIG-I promoter (Extended Data Fig. 4k). Deletion of the HINa domain in IFI16 abrogated its antiviral activity in response to PR8 virus infection (Extended Data Fig. 4l). Taken together, these data show that IFI16 binds the RIG-I promoter with its HINa domain facilitating the recruitment of RNA Pol II to the site, thereby enhancing the transcriptional activation of RIG-I.IFI16 binds vRNAs and interacts with RIG-ISince IFI16 is also a RBP, we determined whether IFI16 binds vRNAs as with the RIG-I promoter. Pull-down assays using cell lysates of HEK293 cells, separately overexpressing Flag-tagged IFI16, RIG-I, MDA-5 and TBK1 proteins, incubated with biotinylated NP vRNA showed binding of IFI16, RIG-I and MDA-5 to the vRNAs (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Microscale thermophoresis technology (MST) results showed that the HINa domain also exhibited high affinity for full-length NS vRNA (Extended Data Fig. 5b). To further demonstrate binding between IFI16 and other IAV RNAs, purified glutathione S-transferase (GST)–IFI16 proteins were incubated with fluorescein-labelled HA, NP, PA and PB2 vRNAs. MST assays also showed IFI16 binding with the different vRNAs (Extended Data Fig. 5c). Furthermore, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed increasing colocalization of IFI16 with NP vRNA in PR8-virus-infected A549 cells at 6 and 12 h.p.i. (Fig. 6a). To identify bound vRNAs during infection, RNA eluted from co-precipitation of IFI16–Flag from IAV-infected RIG-I−/− cells was subjected to deep sequencing analysis, which detected IFI16 binding to all eight IAV gene segments (Fig. 6b). RIG-I has been found with IAV genomic fragments37. IFI16 was also specifically enriched in genomic IAV segments during infection (Fig. 6b). Importantly, only WT IFI16 and IFI16 mutants bearing the HINa domain associated with vRNA fragments during infection (Fig. 6c and Extended Data Fig. 5d,e). Taken together, these results indicate that during infection, IFI16 can directly bind viral genome RNAs via its HINa domain.Fig. 6: IFI16 binds vRNA and associates with RIG-I protein.a, Images showing colocalization of endogenous IFI16 (green) and viral NP RNA (red) in PR8-virus-infected A549 cells at 0, 6 and 12 h.p.i. was detected by RNA FISH.

The right panels are enlarged. Red points indicate IFI16 plus RIG-I complexes, green points indicate the viral M1 protein. Data are representative of three independent experiments.Source dataFull size imageTo determine whether IFI16 is involved in the recognition of vRNAs by RIG-I during influenza virus infection, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays were performed, and the results demonstrated that there is an endogenous interaction of IFI16 and RIG-I during PR8 virus infection in A549 cells (Fig. 6d,e). Furthermore, in situ PLA microscopy showed colocalization of IFI16 and RIG-I in the cytoplasm of PR8-virus-infected A549 cells (Fig. 6f). Consistent with the PLA results, confocal microscopy also found an increasing interaction between IFI16 and RIG-I during IAV infection (Extended Data Fig. 5f). The PYRIN domain can mediate the interaction between IFI16 and host proteins38,39. Accordingly, the IFI16-ΔPYRIN–GFP mutant was unable to colocalize with RIG-I in HEK293 cells, thereby indicating that the PYRIN domain is required in the protein–protein interaction (Extended Data Fig. 5g). Interestingly, PYRIN–GFP transfection into HEK293 cells resulted in its protein colocalization with RIG-I, which formed filamentous structures (Extended Data Fig. 5h,i). IFI16 filamentous structures are involved in antiviral responses by associating with host restriction factors40,41,42. Collectively, these findings indicate that IFI16 binds influenza vRNAs and associates with RIG-I in influenza-virus-infected cells.RIG-I is required for IFI16-mediated antiviral responses in IAV infectionK63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I by TRIM25 is essential for its activation11. To explore the potential role of IFI16 in the promotion of RIG-I signalling, we examined the interaction between TRIM25 and RIG-I in PR8-virus-infected IFI16+/+ and IFI16−/− A549 cells. Co-IP and in situ PLA experiments indicated that IFI16 deficiency impaired the interaction and colocalization between RIG-I and TRIM25 due to their reduced expression in infected IFI16−/− cells, and inhibited K63-linked ployubiquitination of RIG-I during virus infection (Extended Data Figs. 6a,b and 7a). To further determine the impact of IFI16 on RIG-I polyubiquitination, we transfected HEK293 cells with Myc control or IFI16–Myc, RIG-I–Flag, TRIM25–His and either HA-ubiquitin, HA-ubiquitin-K48 or HA-ubiquitin-K63 plasmids. Co-IP experiments showed that IFI16 remarkably enhanced the interaction between TRIM25 and RIG-I and promoted RIG-I polyubiquitination in the presence of HA-ubiquitin and HA-ubiquitin-K63, but not HA-ubiquitin-K48 (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Thus, IFI16 facilitates TRIM25 binding to RIG-I and consequently promotes K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and RT–qPCR assays showed that overexpression of IFI16 significantly enhanced the RIG-I binding to PA vRNA (Extended Data Fig. 7c). Correspondingly, IFI16 deficiency also markedly reduced RIG-I binding to PA vRNA in PR8-virus-infected A549 cells (Extended Data Fig. 7d). RIP and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and RNA pull-down experiments further demonstrated that the binding of PA vRNA with RIG-I is sharply increased with increasing amounts of IFI16 (Extended Data Fig. 6c,d). Furthermore, RNA co-purified with RIG-I by RIP analysis from IAV-infected IFI16+/+ cells induced the production of IFN-β more effectively than that from IFI16−/− cells (Extended Data Fig. 7e,f), which suggests that IFI16 facilitates the stable binding of RIG-I to vRNAs during IAV infection. Importantly, only WT IFI16 and IFI16 mutants bearing the HINa and PYRIN domain, but not HINb, promoted vRNA binding to RIG-I (Extended Data Fig. 6e) and enhanced the production of IFN-β during IAV infection (Extended Data Fig. 6f). Consistent with these observations, IFN-β reporter assays showed that overexpression of IFI16 significantly enhanced PR8-virus-induced expression of IFN-β–luciferase reporter genes (Extended Data Fig. 7g). Moreover, the RIG-I-induced activity of IFN-β–luciferase reporter rose with increasing amounts of IFI16 expression vectors used in transfections (Extended Data Fig. 7h). Taken together, these results suggest that IFI16 promotes the activation of RIG-I signalling and, in so doing, boosts the production of IFN-I.Finally, to investigate whether the antiviral function of IFI16 in IAV infection is dependent on RIG-I, A549 cells were transfected with the RIG-I- or MAVS-targeting siRNAs and then infected with IAV. Western blotting showed that the level of RIG-I or MAVS was significantly reduced by RIG-I-targeting siRNA-2835 (Extended Data Fig. 7i) or MAVS-targeting siRNA-571 transfection (Extended Data Fig. 6g). IAV infection could not effectively stimulate the production of IFN-β in RIG-I- or MAVS-silenced IFI16+/+ A549 cells (Extended Data Figs. 6h and 7j). Overexpression of IFI16 in RIG-I- or MAVS-silenced A549 cells could not induce the production of IFN-β during IAV infection (Extended Data Figs. 6l and 7k). RIG-I−/− HEK293 cells were then transfected with IFI16–Flag or Flag vectors and then infected with PR8 virus at 1 m.o.i. Overexpression of IFI16 failed to inhibit viral NP and M1 replication in PR8-virus-infected RIG-I−/− cells at 6 and 12 h.p.i. (Extended Data Fig. 7l), whereas exogenous expression of RIG-I in RIG-I−/− cells rescued the inhibitory effect of IFI16 on viral titres at 24 h.p.i. (Extended Data Fig. 7m). Taken together, our results indicate that the antiviral function of IFI16 is dependent on RIG-I.DiscussionHost cells possess critical sensors that can discriminate viral and host nucleic acids. IFI16 has been demonstrated to be a sensor of viral DNA in innate immune signalling16,17. However, its role in sensing vRNA during infection, in particular influenza virus infection, is hitherto unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that IFI16 is a viral RBP and is induced during influenza virus infection. IFI16 inhibited influenza virus replication in human cell lines and in mice through an enhanced induction of IFN-I. IFI16 enhances the transcription of RIG-I, binds vRNAs and interacts with the RIG-I protein, thereby increasing the sensitivity of RIG-I signalling. These findings establish a critical role for IFI16 in antiviral innate immune responses to influenza virus and possibly other RNA viruses (a proposed signalling model is depicted in Extended Data Fig. 8).We found that IFI16 was strongly induced by IAV, which is consistent with previous findings that IFI16 can be induced by RNA virus infection and be upregulated by the type I and type III IFNs as an ISG27,28,29. IFI16 is known to boost sensing of intracellular DNA and subsequent IFN-I induction21,24,26; it functions as a cytoplasmic immune-sensor-mediating pyroptotic death of tissue CD4+ T cells abortively infected with HIV-1 (ref. 22). Thus, the main role of IFI16 had been assumed to be a cytoplasmic sensor of viral DNA43. However, this is at odds with the findings that IFI16 is predominantly localized in the nucleus36. We found that IFI16 is induced in the nucleus and acts as a positive transcriptional regulator of RIG-I during IAV infection. These results confirm previous findings that IFI16 regulates RNA-virus-mediated IFN-I responses as a transcription factor27. We also found that IFI16 was induced in the cytoplasm and sensed and interacted with influenza vRNAs, which is consistent with recent findings that IFI16 directly binds to incoming chikungunya virus genome RNA and acts as a pattern recognition receptor30. Overexpression of IFI16 in cells significantly increased IFN-β expression and reduced viral titres, whereas knockdown or knockout of IFI16 had the opposite effects, which suggests that IFI16 is an important antiviral factor in IAV infection. Therefore, we demonstrated an important mechanism of IFI16 in RLR-mediated antiviral innate immune responses to influenza virus and furthered our understanding of the role of IFI16 in innate immunity.The vRNA sensor RIG-I is thought to be the most important sensor of influenza virus infection9 in the recognition of cytoplasmic double-stranded RNA that leads to the transcriptional activation of IFN-I and downstream ISGs14. Thus, identification of positive regulators of RIG-I could be important in the control of virus infection. DNA-dependent activator of IFN-regulatory factor (DAI), a cytosolic DNA sensor, has already been found to recognize genomic RNA and regulate virus-induced cell-death pathways and thereby plays an important role in the pathogenesis of IAV infection44,45. Here, we demonstrated that IFI16 binds to vRNAs and enhances the RIG-I-mediated production of IFN-I during IAV infection. We further identified that IFI16 interacted with RIG-I via the PYRIN domain of IFI16. An interaction of IFI16 with RIG-I as a complex via siRNA was previously reported46. Notably, we found that IFI16 facilitates RIG-I binding to IAV vRNAs during infection and promotes virus-induced K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I, thereby indicating that IFI16 positively contributes to RIG-I-dependent antiviral responses. It is currently not clear whether the filamentous structures of IFI16 are necessary for IFI16–vRNA and IFI16–RIG-I interactions or about the types of vRNA structures that are needed to interact with IFI16.Collectively, our study showed that IFI16 induced by influenza virus infection positively regulates RIG-I signalling by enhancing its transcriptional expression through recruitment of RNA Pol II to the RIG-I promoter, and sensing of vRNA to promote virus-induced K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I. This study highlights an important mechanism of IFI16 in RLR-mediated innate antiviral immune responses to IAV and possibly other RNA virus infections, and expands our understanding of the functions of the innate immune system in intracellular virus recognition, which could help the development of new strategies to modulate antiviral responses.MethodsEthics statementAll animal experiments were performed in accordance with institutional guidelines of China Agricultural University (CAU) (approval SKLAB-B-2010-003) and approved by the Beijing Association for Science and Technology of China (approval SYXK, Beijing, 2007–0023).CellsMadin–Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK), human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) and human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells (A549) were maintained in-house.

T7 transcription reactions were carried out with T7 RNA polymerase in transcription buffer and biotin-dNTPs mix according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega)51. Following DNase I treatment, biotin-labelled vRNAs were extracted with phenol–chloroform, ethanol precipitated and purified with RNAeasy columns (Aidlab Biotechnologies) and analysed on denaturing agarose gels for correct size.AP–MSTHP-1 cells were treated with phorbolmyristateacetate for 12 h, and infected with H7N9 virus (1 m.o.i.). After 12 h of infection, cells were lysed with lysis buffer and incubated with in vitro-transcribed 2 pM biotin-labelled vRNAs for 4 h followed by incubation with pre-washed Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin (Sigma) for 3 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed five times with NT2 buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2 and 0.05% NP-40). Protein complex bound to the beads was then boiled with 20 μl PBS at 100 °C for 10 min. Pulled-down proteins were identified by liquid chromatography–MS.Western blottingWestern blotting was performed as previously described49. Briefly, protein samples were mixed with loading buffer supplemented with 10% β-mercaptoethanol, heated at 95 °C for 5 min and separated on a 10% SDS–PAGE under reducing conditions. After electrophoresis, protein samples were electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) and blocked for 2 h in Tris-buffered saline (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mM NaCl) containing 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk and 0.5‰ (v/v) Tween-20. The blots were incubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C.

HRP antibody binding was detected using a standard enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Thermo Scientific).RT–qPCRTotal RNA from virus-infected cells or lung tissues was extracted using an RNA isolation kit (Thermo Scientific). First-strand complementary DNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using a TransScript RT reagent kit (TransGen). Uni-12 primer was used for the detection of influenza vRNA, and oligo dT and random primers were used for detecting host and viral genes. Generated cDNA was subjected to qPCR in a 25-μl reaction volume using FastStart Universal SYBR Green master mix (Roche). Human β-actin (ACTB) and mouse GAPDH genes were amplified for normalization of the cDNA amount used in qPCR. Reactions were conducted in triplicate, and the data were analysed using the 2−ΔΔCt method. qPCR primers used in this study are provided in the Supplementary Information.IFN-I bioassayDuring PR8 virus infection, IFN-I released in the human cell culture medium was quantified in 2fTGH-ISRE cells as previously described52. In brief, 200 ml of cell culture supernatant was incubated with confluent 2fGTH-ISRE-Luci cells in a 24-well plate for 6 h. Cells were then lysed in passive lysis buffer and subjected to luciferase quantification (Promega). A serial dilution of recombinant human IFN-β (Invitrogen) was used as reference.Luciferase reporter assaysHEK293 cells seeded on 24-well plates were co-transfected with 125 ng of the luciferase reporter plasmids and an equal amount of various expression plasmids or empty controls. Ten nanograms of pRL-TK plasmid was used as an internal control. At 24 h after transfection, Renilla luciferase and firefly luciferase expression levels were measured in the presence or absence of virus stimulation for 12 h using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay kit (Promega) in a TD-20/20 Luminometer according to the manufacturers’ recommendations. Results were normalized to corresponding control reporter constructs.Gaussia luciferase reporter assays were performed according to standard procedures described in detail elsewhere48. Briefly, HEK293T-Gluc cells were transfected with either IFI16–Flag or Flag control plasmids followed by infection with PR8 virus (1 m.o.i.) for 24 h, and viral infectivity was evaluated by measuring Gluc activity. After a further 24 h of incubation, cell supernatants were collected and measured for Gluc activity. Dimethylsulfoxide was used as negative controls. The inhibition rate of the tested compounds was calculated with the following equation, where RLU indicates relative light unit:$$\begin{array}{l}{\mathrm{Inhibition}}\,{\mathrm{rate}} = \left( {{\mathrm{RLU}}_{{\mathrm{infected}}\,{\mathrm{cells}}}-{\mathrm{RLU}}_{{\mathrm{tested}}\,{\mathrm{compound}}}} \right)/\\ \quad \quad \quad ({\mathrm{RLU}}_{{\mathrm{infected}}\,{\mathrm{cells}}} - {\mathrm{RLU}}_{{\mathrm{mock}} - {\mathrm{infected}}\,{\mathrm{cells}}})100\%\end{array}$$HistologyWT and p204−/− mice were euthanized at the indicated time points after PR8 virus infection. Lung tissues were collected and fixed with 4% formaldehyde, followed by paraffin embedding. For histopathological analysis, 5- to 7-μm sections were sectioned longitudinally through the left and right lung and stained using a standard haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) protocol.ImmunohistochemistryLung sections were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated with ethanol gradations and water. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked using 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol. PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 was used to wash lung tissue sections between steps. Lung sections were incubated with the primary anti-NP antibody (ab20343) at 1:100 dilution or with the isotype control at the same concentration at 4 °C overnight in a humidified chamber. Sections were subsequently incubated with the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 60 min at RT. Immunodetection was performed using a Vector Elite ABC kit (Vectastain, Vector).Co-IPFor the co-IP assays, A549 cells were infected with PR8 virus (5 m.o.i.). After infection, cell samples were collected and lysed in 800 μl of IP lysis buffer (Thermo Scientific) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. A portion of each whole cell lysate sample was kept to confirm protein expression levels, and 500 μg of cell lysate was used for the co-IP assays. Lysates were incubated with anti-IFI16, anti-RIG-I or IgG antibodies overnight at 4 °C under constant rotation, and then 40 μl of protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz) were added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C under gentle rotation. The beads were then washed four times with cold lysis buffer and analysed by SDS–PAGE and western blotting.RIP–qPCRTwo 10-cm2 dishes (107 cells per dish) of A549 cells were infected with PR8 virus for 12 h. Cells were lysed with RIP lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, 150 mM KCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM NaF, 0.5% NP40, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1× protease inhibitor cocktail and 25 U RNasin) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 r.p.m. for 15 min at 4 °C and the supernatants were subjected to RIP. A 50 μl aliquot of cell supernatant was saved as input, and the remaining samples were each incubated with 5 μg anti-IFI16 antibody or IgG antibody and 40 μl protein A/G beads for 10 h at 4 °C under gentle shaking. After IP, the beads were pelleted and washed four times with RIP wash buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2 and 0.05% NP40), resuspended in 250 ml of DNase digestion buffer (40 mM Tris pH 8.0, 10 mM MgSO4 and 1 mM CaCl2) and treated with 25 U RNasin (Promega) and 2 U DNase I (NEB) at 37 °C for 20 min. Beads were then washed and resuspended in 100 μl RIP wash buffer, 10% of each sample was removed for immunoblot analysis. Samples were treated with 4 U proteinase K at 55 °C for 30 min. The input and immunoprecipitated RNAs were isolated by 1 ml of TRIzol reagent (Sigma), and vRNAs were analysed by RT–qPCR or RNA sequencing.ChIP–qPCRApproximately 107 treated cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at RT for 10 min, and the crosslinking was quenched with 0.125 M glycine for 5 min. Cells were then collected by centrifugation, lysed with SDS lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail and sonicated to shear the DNA. The sonicated DNA–protein complexes were incubated with anti-IFI16 (Cell Signaling Technology, D8B5T), anti-RNA Pol II (Abcam, ab238450) or control IgG (Beyotime, A7016) antibodies. The immunocomplexes were collected using Protein G Dynabeads (10004d, Invitrogen). The Dynabeads were washed once with wash buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS and 1% Triton X-100), once with wash buffer B (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 250 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA and 1%NP-40) and three times with wash buffer C (1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The beads were eluted with 100 ml elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM EDTA and 1% SDS) followed by incubation at 65 °C overnight to reverse crosslinking. The next day, the DNA was purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Magen, D211102) and analysed using FastStart Universal SYBR Green master mix (Roche).Confocal microscopyA549 or HEK293 cells on coverslips were washed twice with pre-warmed PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at RT. Cells were subsequently permeabilized with immunostaining permeabilization buffer containing Triton X-100 (Beyotime) for 10 min and blocked in QuickBlock blocking buffer for 20 min at RT. Fixed cells were incubated with indicated antibodies diluted in immunostaining primary antibody dilution buffer at 4 °C overnight. Coverslips were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies or Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at 37 °C. Coverslips were finally washed three times and mounted onto microscope slides with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining solution (Beyotime) for 8 min and examined by confocal microscopy. Immunostained cells were visualized using a Nikon super-resolution laser scanning confocal microscope under a ×100 oil objective and analysed using the Imaris 9.2 platform.In situ PLA microscopyA DuoLink PLA kit (DUO92105-1KT, Sigma) was used to test protein–protein interactions as described in the protocol. WT or IFI16−/− A549 cells were infected with PR8 virus at 1 m.o.i. for 12 h, fixed and permeabilized as described in the “Confocal microscopy” section and blocked with DuoLink blocking buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were incubated with corresponding primary antibodies diluted in DuoLink dilution buffer. After washing, cells were incubated with species-specific PLA probes (Plus and Minus) for 1 h at 37 °C under hybridization conditions and in the presence of two additional oligonucleotides to facilitate hybridization of PLA probes if they were in close proximity (<40 nm). Ligase was then added and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C to join hybridized oligonucleotides. Amplification polymerase was added to generate a concatemeric product extending from the oligonucleotide arm of the PLA probe. Finally, a detection solution consisting of fluorescently labelled oligonucleotides was added, and the labelled oligonucleotides were hybridized to the concatemeric products. Nuclei was stained with Duolink in situ mounting medium containing DAPI.Ubiquitination assayHEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding RIG-I–Flag, TRIM25-His with or without coexpression of IFI16–Myc or Myc empty vectors, and HA-ubiquitin (WT) or HA-ubiquitin mutants (K48 or K63). After 24 h of transfection, cells were collected and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS and 1 mM EDTA) containing protease inhibitor cocktail and 10 µM deubiquitinase inhibitor N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma). The cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody overnight at 4 °C and then beads were added to the samples for 1–1.5 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer and analysed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody.RNA FISHA549 cells were grown in 24-well slide chambers and infected with PR8 at a m.o.i. of 1. At 12 h.p.i., cells were fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, then permeabilized and dehydrated by sequential 3-min incubations as follows: once with 70% ethanol, once with 85% ethanol and three times with 100% ethanol. Cells were then hybridized with the Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated NP RNA target probes (NP-probes, GenePharma) of PR8 virus in hybridization buffer for 10 min at 75 °C. Cells were further incubated for 12–16 h at 37 °C. Finally, cells were stained with anti-IFI16 and secondary antibodies, and nuclei were stained with DAPI as previously described.MSTHEK293 cells were separately transfected with the HINa–GFP, HINb–GFP and PYRIN–GFP expression vectors. After 24 h of transfection, cell lysates were collected and incubated with twofold serial dilutions of indicated vRNAs in MST-optimized buffer at a constant concentration (20–100 nM). Equal volumes of binding reactions were mixed by pipetting and incubated for 15 min at RT. Mixtures were enclosed in standard-treated glass capillaries and loaded into the instrument (Monolith NT.115, NanoTemper). To identify whether IFI16 directly binds to the IAV RNAs, the transcribed RNAs were labelled with fluorescein RNA labelling mix (11685619910, Sigma) and purified as previously described53. Purified GST–IFI16 proteins (Abcam, ab158724) were incubated with different amounts of IAV full-length fluorescein-labelled RNAs, followed by MST assays. For all the measurements, 200–1,000 counts were obtained for the fluorescence intensity. Dissociation constant (Kd) values were determined using the NanoTemper analysis tool.RNA pull-down assayHEK293 cells were transfected with Flag-tagged RIG-I, IFI16, TBK1 or MAVS vectors. After 24 h of transfection, cells were collected and lysed with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2 and 0.05% NP-40). Cell lysates were mixed with transcribed biotin-labelled viral NP RNA for 4 h at 4 °C and incubated with pre-washed Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin (Sigma) for another 3 h at 4 °C. The protein samples bound to the beads were boiled and analysed by SDS–PAGE and western blotting.DNA pull-down assayIFI16 proteins were purified from IFI16–Flag-overexpressing HEK293 cells by immunoprecipitation using M2 beads (Sigma). Biotinylated mutant DNA probes were synthesized using an EMSA Probe Biotin Labelling kit (Beyotime, GS008) and were annealed and incubated with the purified Flag-tagged IFI16 proteins for 30 min in binding buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM KCl, 1%NP-40, 1 mM EDTA and 5% glycerol) at RT. Then, 40 μl prewashed Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin (Sigma) was added for incubation at 4 °C for 1 h. The mutant probe-binding proteins were eluted by boiling and analysed by immunoblotting.Statistical analysisFor all the bar graphs, data are shown as the mean ± s.e.m. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software v.7.00 (GraphPad Software). The Kaplan–Meier method was employed for survival analysis. Differences in means were considered statistically significant at P < 0.05. And significance levels are as follow: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; NS, not significant.Reporting SummaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Here we show that the requirement of RIPK3 for protection against IAV infection in vivo is only apparent within a limited dose range of IAV challenge. We found that this protective outcome is independent from RIPK3 kinase activity and from MLKL. This shows that platform function of RIPK3 rather than its kinase activity is required for protection, suggesting that a RIPK3 function independent of necroptosis is implicated. In line with this finding, we show that FADD-dependent apoptosis has a crucial additional effect in protection against IAV infection. Altogether, we show that RIPK3 contributes to protection against IAV in a narrow challenge dose range by a mechanism that is independent of its kinase activity and its capacity to induce necroptosis.

IAVs can cause influenza in birds and some mammals, including humans. In mammals, IAV typically infects lung epithelial cells and replicates in the nucleus where the virus also hijacks the host’s transcription machinery1. Programmed cell death (PCD) plays a role as a cell-autonomous defense mechanism by which infected cells die resulting in limited viral replication and spreading2. Apoptosis is the major type of PCD upon in vitro infection of cells with IAV3,4, but necroptosis and pyroptosis were also shown to be elicited5,6,7,8,9. Many viruses have evolved genes that can block apoptosis such as viral inhibitor of caspase-8 activation (vICA) and viral mitochondria-localized inhibitor of apoptosis (vMIA) in mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV)10. These viral proteins allow viruses to escape PCD. From an evolutionary point of view necroptosis is an alternative cell death mechanism that promotes the killing of host cells that acquired resistance to caspase-8-mediated cell-extrinsic apoptosis and can also restrict pathogen replication11. Receptor-interacting serinehreonine-protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) is activated by RIP Homology Interaction Motif (RHIM)-dependent recruitment to RIPK1, TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF) or Z-nucleic acid Binding Protein-1 (ZBP1)10,12. This results in RIPK3 autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of its substrate mixed lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase (MLKL)13,14 which destabilizes the plasma membrane and executes necroptosis15,16.RIPK3 was reported to be crucial for the protection against IAV. Some studies report that Ripk3−/− mice are more susceptible to IAV infection suggesting the importance of this protein in the in vivo protection against IAV infection5,7,17. During IAV replication virally-derived RNA molecules are sensed by ZBP1, which binds to RIPK3 to initiate parallel cell modality outcomes of pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis within the population of infected cells, collectively coined PANoptosis18. Intracellular viral replication also activates RIPK3 to drive PCD19. In vitro, RIPK3 was shown to activate in parallel both MLKL-mediated necroptosis and Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD)-induced apoptosis in IAV infected cells7. It was also shown that replicating IAV activates the RNA sensor ZBP1 in the nucleus, followed by RIPK3 activation and nuclear MLKL phosphorylation resulting in nuclear envelope disruption, and necroptosis20. However, the involvement of necroptosis in IAV infection remains controversial in vivo. While some studies report that RIPK3-mediated necroptosis may negatively impact on survival by inducing immunopathology21, others show that necroptosis does not affect survival and that it functions as a protective backup mechanism only when the proteolytic inactivity of caspase-8 is compromised16,20. We hypothesized that these apparent discrepancies in the susceptibility in terms of survival between of Ripk3−/− mice to IAV infection may be due to differences in the viral dose used to challenge the mice. Moreover, previous conclusions related to the role of necroptosis in IAV infection through the use of Ripk3−/− mice should be taken with caution as RIPK3 is required to induce both apoptosis and necroptosis downstream of ZBP16. While some studies suggest that necroptosis ensures protection against IAV in murine12,21 others found that necroptosis is only functioning as a backup mechanism when apoptosis is blocked5. Furthermore, in response to an IAV challenge dose that was lethal for wild-type (WT) mice, a significant fraction of the Mlkl/− mice survived this challenge dose20. These discrepancies between studies that report increased susceptibility of RIPK3-deficient mice to IAV infection7,17,20 and those that described no change in susceptibility between Ripk3−/− mice and WT controls21, may be due to differences in the viral dose used to challenge the mice. Here, we investigated the susceptibility of RIPK3-deficient mice to a range of viral doses and examined the possible involvement of either RIPK3-induced necroptosis or apoptosis. Our results confirm that RIPK3 is implicated in a protective response during viral infection but only at a limited range of IAV challenge doses. Moreover, we demonstrate that the protective effect is independent of RIPK3 kinase activity and its downstream substrate MLKL. We additionally show that FADD is crucial for protection against limited IAV challenge doses. We therefore propose that RIPK3 platform activity-dependent and FADD-mediated apoptosis partially protect laboratory mice against IAV-infection in vivo.ResultsRIPK3-mediated protection is only observed at medium dose of IAV infection in vivoTo assess the protective role of RIPK3 against IAV challenge in vivo, we challenged WT littermates and RIPK3-deficient mice with different doses of PR8 virus, a commonly used human-origin laboratory strain of IAV. We exposed the mice to different infection doses: very low IAV dose (0.05x LD50 or 4 pfu), low dose (0.1x LD50 or 8 pfu), medium IAV dose (0.2x LD50 or 16 pfu) and high IAV dose (0.5x LD50 or 40 pfu). Following a very low challenge dose (0.05x LD50/4 pfu), Ripk3−/− and WT mice displayed similar mortality and most of the mice survived the challenge (as defined in Materials and Methods) (Fig. 1a, b). Doubling the challenge dose from 0.05x LD50/4 pfu to 0.1x LD50/8 pfu revealed a tendency towards increased sensitivity of RIPK3-deficient mice, though not statistically significant. For the medium viral dose of infection (0.2x LD50/16 pfu) the susceptibility of Ripk3−/− mice is significantly potentiated (p value= 0.0218) compared to Ripk3+/+ littermates. Infection with high viral dose (0.5x LD50/40 pfu) leads to 100% lethality in both Ripk3−/− mice and Ripk3+/+ littermates (Fig. 1d). Altogether, these results suggest that, in contrast to many studies that report only one dose of viral infection, the involvement of RIPK3 for protection against IAV infection is partial and can only be demonstrated within a narrow dose-range, which is in our case the medium dose of 0.2x LD50/16 pfu. For this dose, the surviving Ripk3−/− mice seem to suffer slightly more weight loss compared to WT controls. This is most probably due to slower recovery of the RIPK3-deficient mice and not due to enhanced morbidity during the first 9–10 days of infection. We do not observe any shift in the bodyweight loss curve for the other infection doses suggesting that RIPK3 only affects the mortality threshold (i.e. the ethical endpoint) of the mice (Fig. 1).Fig. 1: RIPK3 is partially required for protection at medium IAV dose in vivo.Survival analysis and body weight loss of age-matched Ripk3−/− and Ripk3+/+ mice infected intranasally with IAV is shown at very low dose: 0.05x LD50/4 pfu; (a), low dose: 0.1x LD50/8 pfu p value = 0.3340 (b), medium dose: 0.2x LD50/16 pfu p value= 0.0218 (c) and high dose: 0.5x LD50/40 pfu (d). Data were pooled from 2 (panel A and B) or 3 (c, d) independent experiments. Bodyweight curves are shown as mean ± SD. Survival curves were plotted for indicated groups and evaluated statistically according to Kaplan–Meier. A log-rank test verified significant differences between Ripk3+/+ and Ripk3−/− mice (GraphPad Prism 7). *p < 0.05.Full size imageMLKL does not protect against different IAV challenge doses in vivoIn view of the reported protective role of the RIPK3-MLKL axis against IAV infection of cells in vitro7 and because of the protective role of RIPK3 in vivo at certain infection doses of IAV (Fig. 1), we wanted to clarify whether RIPK3 acted through activation of MLKL during in vivo IAV infection. Therefore, we challenged MLKL-deficient mice and their littermate controls with low (0.1x LD50/ 8 pfu) medium (0.2x LD50/16 pfu) and high IAV doses (0.5x LD50/40 pfu). Survival analysis and bodyweight loss curves are shown in Fig. 2a–c. Mlkl+/+ and MLKL-deficient mice displayed the same bodyweight loss and survival at any of the challenge doses used, excluding a role for MLKL downstream of RIPK3 during protection against medium-dose IAV infection. This confirms previously published results where deficiency of MLKL alone did not affect the lethal sensitivity during IAV infection5,16.Fig. 2: MLKL is not required for partial protection against IAV infection at different viral doses.Survival analysis and bodyweight loss of age-matched Mlkl−/− and Mlkl+/+ infected intranasally with IAV is shown at each infection: low dose: 0.1x LD50/8 pfu (a), medium dose: 0.2x LD50/16 pfu (b) and high dose: 0.5x LD50/40 pfu (c). Data were pooled from 2 (a, c) or 3 (b) independent experiments. Bodyweight curves are shown as mean ± SD. Survival curves were plotted for indicated groups and evaluated statistically according to Kaplan–Meier (GraphPad Prism 7). NS not significant.Full size imageRIPK3 platform function but not its kinase activity is required for protection against medium IAV infection dose in vivoTo examine if the kinase activity of RIPK3 is important for the protection against IAV, we infected with different IAV doses (low, medium, high, as defined above) mice that lack the kinase activity of RIPK3, i.e. RIPK3K51A knock in mice. The bodyweight loss and lethality of Ripk3 KD-KIK51A/K51A mice infected with low (0.1x LD50/8 pfu), medium (0.2x LD50/16 pfu), and high viral dose (0.5x LD50/40 pfu) are not statistically significantly different from their littermates, the Ripk3 KD-KI+/+ (Fig. 3a–c). This suggests that that the kinase activity of RIPK3 apparently is not required for the protective effect during IAV infection. This observation is in line with the absence of a sensitizing phenotype in Mlkl−/− mice following IAV infection (Fig. 2a–c). Altogether our findings favor a model in which the platform function of RIPK3 rather than its RIPK3 kinase activity and consecutive MLKL-mediated necroptosis is implicated in the protective effect against the medium dose IAV infection in vivo.Fig. 3: RIPK3 kinase activity is not required for partial protection against IAV infection at different viral doses.Survival analysis and bodyweight loss of age-matched Ripk3 KD-KIK51A/K51A and Ripk3 KD-KI+/+ mice infected intranasally with IAV is shown at each infection dose: low dose: 0.1x LD50/8 pfu, (a), medium dose: 0.2x LD50/16 pfu, (b) and high dose: 0.5x LD50/40 pfu (c). Data were pooled from 2 (panel A), 3 (c) or 5 (b) independent experiments. Bodyweight curves are shown as mean ± SD. Survival curves were plotted for indicated groups and evaluated statistically according to Kaplan–Meier (GraphPad Prism 7). NS not significant.Full size imageFADD is required for RIPK3-mediated protection against low and medium IAV doses in vivoRIPK3 can function as a platform that stimulates apoptosis22. Since Fadd−/−mice die in utero23 due to excessive RIPK3/MLKL-mediated necroptosis in multiple tissues24, we infected Ripk3−/−Fadd−/− double knock out (DKO) mice with low (0.1x LD50/8 pfu), medium (0.2x LD50/16 pfu), and high viral dose (0.5x LD50/40 pfu) of IAV infection to study the possible contribution of the FADD-caspase-8 apoptotic axis. These DKO mice are born at normal Mendelian frequency and develop normally25. Their survival and bodyweight loss were monitored up to 18 days post-IAV infection (Fig. 4a–c). Interestingly, already at a low dose of infection (0.1x LD50/8 pfu) Ripk3−/−Fadd−/− DKO mice showed enhanced susceptibility to IAV compared to their littermates (p value= 0.0878) and compared to RIPK3-deficient mice (p value =0.0066). All Ripk3−/−Fadd−/− DKO mice died after the challenge, none of them being able to recover from infection-induced morbidity compared to the control mice (Fig. 4a–c). These results resemble the previously reported phenotype of sensitization following IAV infection of Fadd−/−Mlkl−/− DKO7 or the Casp8DAMlkl−/− mice5. This suggests the importance of FADD-dependent apoptosis in the protection against IAV infection. Moreover, the susceptibility of Ripk3−/− Fadd−/− double knock-out mice is further increased compared to RIPK3-deficient mice for the same doses, suggesting that residual RIPK3-independent and FADD-dependent apoptosis mediates protection against IAV independent from RIPK3 or MLKL (Fig. 4a).Fig. 4: FADD is required against low and medium IAV doses in vivo.Survival analysis and bodyweight loss of age-matched Ripk3−/−Fadd−/− DKO and WT controls Ripk3+/+ Fadd+/+ as well as single Ripk3−/− and Ripk3+/+ mice infected intranasally with PR8 are shown: low dose: 0.1x LD50/8 pfu (a), medium dose: 0.2x LD50/16 pfu (b) and high dose: 0.5x LD50/40 pfu (c). Data were pooled from 2 (a) or 3 independent experiments (b, c). Bodyweight curves are shown as mean ± SD. Survival curves were plotted for indicated groups and evaluated statistically according to Kaplan–Meier (GraphPad Prism 7). NS not significant; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001.Full size imageDiscussionSeveral reports have highlighted the role of RIPK3 in the protection against IAV infection5,7,17,21. Furthermore, it was shown that genetic deletion of ripk3 rescued cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2 (cIAP2)-deficient mice from influenza-induced lethality via RIPK3-mediated necroptosis21. In contrast, it has also been reported that infection with a sublethal IAV dose resulted in similar susceptibility of RIPK3-deficient mice as WT mice21, suggesting that the in vivo protective role of RIPK3 against IAV challenge infection may be dose dependent. This absence of phenotype of RIPK3-deficient mice is comparable to what we observe when mice are infected with a very low and low IAV dose. This observation is in contrast with other studies that reported that RIPK3-deficient mice were highly susceptible to a sublethal viral (50 pfu) dose as well as to a lethal dose (90 pfu, 1x LD50) of IAV, including the PR8 virus strain that we used here7,17. Therefore, the opposing conclusions in the literature with regard to the protective role of RIPK3 following IAV challenge might be very likely explained by discrepancies in doses of IAV challenge leading to between reports emphasizing its protective role7 or those dismissing a role for RIPK317. Importantly, in our study we reconcile these observations by demonstrating that depending on the challenge dose range, RIPK3 can contribute or not to protection against IAV infection in vivo.Next, we addressed whether the role of RIPK3 in partial IAV protection could be attributed to RIPK3-mediated MLKL phosphorylation and necroptosis execution. MLKL-deficient mice challenged with different IAV infection doses (low, medium, and high) did not exhibit increased susceptibility compared to WT littermates suggesting that necroptosis execution mechanism apparently is not implicated in IAV protection in vivo, confirming previously published data7,20. This result prompted the question whether the RIPK3 kinase activity would be implicated or not in the in vivo protection. To this end, we challenged RIPK3 kinase activity deficient Ripk3 KD-KIK51A/K51A mice with different IAV doses. These mice responded like control littermates excluding the RIPK3 kinase involvement in the protective process to IAV in murine hosts. We noticed that not all littermate controls respond equally to the viral challenge. For instance, the Ripk3 KD-KI+/+ and the Mlkl +/+ mice are more susceptible than Ripk3+/+ for the same viral challenge dose (0.2x LD50). The use of littermate controls is essential when comparing the outcome of an immunity-related stimulus between genetically modified strains26,27. Particularly when evaluating viral susceptibility of KO mice, specific littermate controls should be used in each experiment. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves of all the wild-type control littermates for every knockout line used in this study is shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. When we put all results of wild-type littermates with wild-type alleles in one figure, we noticed significant variation in survival following infection with the high dose (0.5x LD50/40 pfu). This illustrates genetic and experimental differences over the years between control littermates with wild-type alleles, reinforcing the point that conclusions can only be drawn using the appropriate littermates. In all figures, we pooled data from mutant mice with appropriate wild type littermate controls each time performed in the same experimental setup as indicated in the figure legends.Besides necroptosis, RIPK3 has also been reported to induce NF-kB activation upon overexpression28, is involved in cytokine production29, can promote activation of apoptosis as a kinase-dead platform22,30 and is implicated in NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation in response to polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] and lipopolysaccharides22,31,32,33 and RNA viruses34. The role in NF-kB activation has been controversial, since experiments based on cells from Ripk3−/− revealed that RIPK3 is dispensable for normal NF-κB, signaling by the B-Cell and T-Cell Receptors, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), and toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR428. RIPK3 was shown to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in IAV infected cells6. Depending on the biological context, RIPK3 was shown to be dispensable for inflammasome activation by RNA viruses35 or required for the NLRP3 inflammasome induced by LPS in which case the kinase activity is required as it can be inhibited by the RIPK3 kinase inhibitor GSK87236. Inflammasome activation is described to be involved in the protection against a wide variety of viruses such as IAV, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), West Nile virus (WNV), Sendai virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). However, two independent studies showed that mice lacking components of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway, such as Caspase-1/11 DKO mice and Nlrp3 KO mice infected with a sublethal IAV dose did not exhibit increased susceptibility compared to their WT littermates suggesting that these pathways apparently are not crucial for protection in this context21,37.As mentioned above, the platform function of RIPK3 is implicated in the induction of apoptosis through the recruitment of RIPK1, FADD, and caspase-822,38. In order to examine this apoptosis-connected platform function of RIPK3, we challenged Ripk3−/− Fadd−/− DKO mice to assess susceptibility to IAV infection. Our results reveal that even a low viral infection dose is sufficient to kill all Ripk3−/−Fadd−/− DKO mice shortly after infection even to a higher extend than Ripk3−/− mice, showing indicating that FADD-mediated apoptosis is implicated. This strong sensitization of IAV-mediated lethality in the absence of both FADD and RIPK3 (this paper) or both FADD and MLKL7, or both caspase 8 protease activity and MLKL5 all argue for the crucial involvement of apoptosis rather than necroptosis in controlling the life or death outcome following IAV infection. Moreover, since the absence of both FADD and RIPK3 sensitizes to lethality following IAV infection even more than loss of RIPK3 kinase activity, a paradigm emerges in which beyond RIPK3 platform-mediated apoptosis also other apoptotic pathways are probably implicated with even higher protective potential. Although we do not show any mechanistical connection between FADD and RIPK3, our results show that in addition to the RIPK3-mediated protection, FADD exerts an additional protective effect. Furthermore, it was described that cytotoxic CD8+ T cells induce Fas-mediated apoptosis to destroy infected cells of the lung epithelia. This process was shown to be crucial for limiting in vivo viral pneumonia due to IAV infection39. Also, caspase-8 is critical for proper TLR and NF-κB involved in immune defense and its loss in B cells is associated with a reduced anti-viral antibody response40. Figure 5 summarizes a model on the involvement of FADD and RIPK3 in the protection against limited doses of IAV infection. In IAV infection, apoptosis is the primary host cell defense mechanism inducing viral clearance and limiting viral spread41. A previous study showed an increase in virus spread, enhanced pulmonary edema, and alveolar damage in influenza A virus-infected Ripk3−/− compared to WT mice. Moreover, the RIPK3-deficient mice also had significantly lower CD3+ and IAV-specific CD8+ T cells7.Fig. 5: Graphic summary: involvement of FADD and RIPK3 in protection at different doses of IAV challenge.After low to medium IAV challenge dose in vivo, intracellular IAV activates FADD to drive apoptosis of infected cells and protects the host (main pathway involved in protection). RIPK3 is not essential to activate FADD-dependent apoptosis post IAV infection. The platform function of RIPK3 can associate with FADD and caspase-8 to drive apoptosis (to a lesser extent than the main pathway which is RIPK3-independent) or other cell death-independent mechanism for protection. The kinase active RIPK3 and downstream MLKL are not involved in the protection against IAV.Full size imageIn conclusion, we propose a paradigm by which RIPK3 platform-dependent and RIPK3-independent FADD-mediated apoptosis are crucial for protection against IAV in vivo, and that MLKL-mediated necroptosis is dispensable at least when the activity of caspase-8 is not compromised. Moreover, our results emphasize the absolute need to examine sensitivity to different viral doses in vivo in order to obtain a comprehensive view on the role of cell death molecules in viral protection. Indeed, often published statements are made based on the use of one single infection dose in vivo possibly leading to incomplete conclusions that only apply to particular IAV infection doses. Moreover, the use of littermate controls is the best good practice while working with mice containing mutated alleles. Even then, small phenotypic differences can occur between different littermate control mice with wild type alleles due to passenger mutations27.Material and methodsMiceRipk3−/− were kindly provided by Dr. Vishva Dixit (Genentech, San Francisco)38, Mlkl−/− by Dr. Alexander Warren and Dr. James Murphy42 and Ripk3 K51A kinase dead knock-in (Ripk3 KD-KIK51A/K51A) mice by Dr. John Bertin by GlaxoSmithKline22. The Ripk3−/− animals were congenic to the C57BL/6 N background, while all other strains were of the C57BL/6 J background, and were therefore compared with the appropriate littermate controls. Ripk3−/− mice were housed in individually ventilated cages in a conventional animal house. The other mice were bred and housed in the SPF facility in individually ventilated cages. Three weeks prior to the experiment all mice were transferred to the conventional animal house and allowed to go through a quarantine and accommodation period of minimum 3 weeks before the infection experiment. Littermate controls of Ripk3−/−, Mlkl−/−, Ripk3−/−Fadd−/− and Ripk3 KD-KIK51A/K51A were used in each experiment. In all experiments, 10–15-week-old mice were used. All animal experiments were done under conditions specified by law (European Directive and Belgian Royal Decree of November 14, 1993) and approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee on Experimental Animals.Viral infectionAge-matched mice were anesthetized with a cocktail of 87,5 mg/kg ketamine and 12,5 mg/kg xylazine intraperitoneally and infected intranasally with 50 μl/20 g phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing different doses of influenza virus A/PR/8/3443, as described in the legends. The plaque-forming units (pfu) were determined by plaque assay on Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells, as described previously44. The LD50 of the viral batch was determined on BALB/c mice and 1x LD50 represented 80 pfu, as determined in the lab of Prof. Saelens. Although the LD50 is not referring to 50% of death in the mice that were used in this study, the nomenclature is used together with the pfu to have a Supplementary information regarding the power of the virus in vivo. This terminology is often used in the papers cited here. Age- and sex-matched mice were challenged with 0.05x LD50 (4 pfu), 0.1x LD50 (8 pfu), 0.2x LD50 (16 pfu) or 0.5x LD50 (40 pfu) and monitored for survival and weight loss over a period of at least 18 days. We used the following 4 scores of clinical symptoms: 0 = no visible signs of disease; 1 = slight ruffling of fur; 2 = ruffled fur, reduced mobility; 3 = ruffled fur, reduced mobility, rapid breathing; 4 = ruffled fur, minimal mobility, huddled appearance, rapid and/or labored breathing indicative of pneumonia and body temperature below 32 °C. For the combination of body weight loss by 30% and a clinical score 4 the mice were considered moribund and euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation or cervical dislocation (EC2016–17).StatisticsAll the survival data were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis using the software Prism 7.04 (GraphPad), and p‐values were calculated.

What will happen next winter? Social distancing and mask wearing helped keep this year's flu cases down. Next year will be different. By Sara Chodosh Posted on May 10, 2021 4:00 PM EDT Flu cases plummeted this year. But we can't use the same methods to curb next year's influenza season. Share Every year, around 45 million people get the flu in the US. This year, it was less than 2,000. It’s an unprecedented low for flu season, and it’s a tribute to how well social distancing measures have worked—though they didn’t stop COVID-19 entirely, influenza has virtually disappeared. This year’s case counts were two-thirds lower than the lowest year previously on record. But this time next year, we’ll almost certainly be much closer to that 45 million mark—some experts warn it could even be a particularly bad year, though it’s unclear which way the pendulum will actually swing. One reason for this is that we’ve had an entire year of being relatively unexposed to the influenza virus. It’s possible that this could make for lower immunity levels and therefore more infections, though one expert told USA Today that the lack of exposure shouldn’t matter. More importantly, the dearth of flu cases means we don’t have much data about which strains are circulating—and that could make choosing the annual flu vaccine more challenging. Each year, experts at the World Health Organization (as well as public health officials in each country) convene to discuss and analyze the data about which influenza viruses are most problematic this year. They then select which strains should be included in the vaccine. Most flu vaccines today are quadrivalent, meaning they contain four different strains. Fewer circulating strains could actually make the vaccine more effective, because it means less genetic diversity. The closer the currently circulating flu strains are to each other, the better the chances of producing a flu vaccine that works well against most of the strains. But there’s also a chance that the genetic diversity amongst flu strains hasn’t actually decreased, it’s just that we’re testing fewer people for flu and therefore not collecting as much data. That could make our annual jab less effective in the end if we accidentally choose a strain that’s well-represented in the data but not actually very prevalent in the real world. This is, unfortunately, one of those situations in which we won’t know until we know. What we can tell for sure is that the measures we took in the past year are extremely effective against the influenza virus. And while no one expects the world to shut down each winter, it’s worth remembering that there are some key practices we can continue to implement to prevent some of the 20,000-plus flu-related deaths each year. Washing your hands, staying home from work when you’re sick, wearing a mask if you’re feeling ill, and getting the annual flu shot can all help keep flu cases low without sacrificing your social life. We’re all pandemic-weary, but those simple measures don’t have to be exhausting. We just need to make them a part of the new norm.

But what boosters do adults need to stay healthy? It is incredibly important — now more than ever as we continue to combat a global pandemic — to protect yourself and those around you from potentially life-threatening illnesses through vaccines. It’s part of my role as a primary care physician to practice preventative medicine. With vaccines, we have an opportunity to prevent a disease from happening or significantly reduce its severity. I feel that it’s my duty to tell my patients about those opportunities. The majority of vaccines are well-tolerated, and the benefits far outweigh the risks. Illnesses like the flu, pneumonia and shingles can be very serious, even for people who consider themselves healthy. When you decide to get a vaccine, you are not only protecting yourself from diseases, but you are stopping the spread of illness for others. I recommend you speak to your primary care physician about your vaccine schedule to ensure you are up-to-date. Here is a list of available vaccines to discuss with your doctor. All routine vaccinations should be given despite the COVID-19 pandemic: Flu (Influenza) Children can receive their first flu vaccine as young as 6 months old and, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), can continue to receive one annually throughout life. You are encouraged to get a flu shot every year, typically in the fall or winter. Since the flu virus changes each year, annual vaccinations are needed. The flu can be very serious in patients who have poor immune systems or patients who are very young or old. However, influenza sometimes can be serious for healthy adults, too. Health systems expect a rise in hospitalizations during the flu season each year. Most physician offices and clinics should have vaccines available in early September. I highly recommend you consider getting your flu vaccine early in the season. The earlier you protect the yourself through vaccination, the less chance you have of contracting the flu virus. Tetanus/Diphtheria/Pertussis People generally get their first tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis (TDap) vaccine at around 11 years old. Adults should receive a TD or TDap booster once every 10 years, especially those who may be at risk of puncture wounds, such as those that occur if you step on a nail. Pregnant patients should get a TD or TDap booster in their third trimester of every pregnancy, preferably in gestational weeks 27–36. That’s because antibodies from the vaccine are passed on to protect the developing baby from whooping cough. Zoster (Shingles) The CDC recommends adults age 50 and older receive the Zoster vaccine to prevent shingles, a viral infection that causes a painful rash. Shingles is caused by the same virus as chickenpox. After shingles has resolved, a condition called postherpetic neuralgia can develop, the most common complication of shingles. This condition causes burning pain in the areas where the shingles rash was, even after the rash and blisters disappear. The pain can last for months or years after the rash goes away. The Zoster vaccine can help prevent both shingles and postherpetic neuralgia. While anyone who has had chickenpox can develop shingles, the risk increases past age 50. Measles/Mumps/Rubella (MMR) Children receive two doses of the MMR vaccine once at 12-15 months and again between 4 and 6 years. Some children may get a similar vaccine (MMRV) that also prevents varicella (chickenpox). Adults can receive the MMR or MMRV vaccine if they did not get it as a child. HPV The CDC recommends receiving a series of vaccines to prevent human papillomavirus, or HPV, the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States. Both men and women can get this immunization between ages 11-12 and 26, but it can be given as early as age 9. It can also be administered after age 26 until 45 in special cases, such as an incomplete vaccination history. Pneumonia “At risk” adults between the ages of 19 and 64 should receive an immunization for pneumonia. Patients may be more susceptible to pneumonia if they smoke, have respiratory diseases such as COPD or asthma, suffer from renal failure, have immune suppression disorders, diabetes, alcoholism or HIV. Primary care physicians recommend all patients older than 65 receive a pneumonia vaccine. International Travel Vaccines Other adults with risk factors including certain medical conditions or lifestyles should also consult their doctors about receiving vaccinations to prevent several types of meningococcal meningitis and Hepatitis A. Patients traveling internationally may benefit from or require a meningococcal vaccine depending on their destination and their pre-existing medical conditions. For each immunization, there are special cases in which people with certain conditions should or should not receive it. Some immunocompromised individuals or those with severe allergies may consider skipping certain vaccines. For information on each immunization and when to be vaccinated, consult CDC’s website. Anything we can do to prevent disease or complications that can be life-changing or fatal is worth doing. Ask Your Primary Care Doctor Overall, it’s important to keep up with your vaccinations and ask your primary care provider any questions you may have. Anything we can do to prevent disease or complications that can be life-changing or fatal is worth doing. It’s important to make an appointment with your primary care physician to have a conversation to understand the benefits and risks of immunizations for you individually. If you switch healthcare providers, make sure your immunization records are transferred. A vaccine card also could be helpful to track what shots you’ve already received and what is due next.

The previous season saw 4,457 positive flu tests statewide, while only 27 people tested positive this season so far, with only four weeks remaining. Nine pediatric deaths were linked to the flu last season, and zero pediatric deaths have been reported this season. COVID has caused over 22,000 deaths in Illinois and 146 deaths in the county. Influenza-like illnesses, commonly referred to as the flu, is defined as fever higher than 100°F with a cough and/or sore throat. Flu activity began to decrease in mid-November 2020, according to Illinois public health officials. The previous year the activity began to spike. The lowest flu activity Illinois experienced this season was in March 2021. The flu season generally ranges from October to May. The highest flu rate in Illinois in the past few seasons was in mid-February of 2020 at 7.4%. Compared to February 2021, there was a 93.2% decrease in flu activity, resulting in the lowest rates in the past five years. The green line shows the rates from last flu season, peaking at week 6 in mid-February. The red line shows rates from this flu season, which have dramatically decreased by week 6 compared to last season. Source: Illinois Department of Public Health Awais Vaid, deputy administrator and epidemiologist at the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District, said the data provided by the Illinois Department of Public Health is reliable. It is standardized for all states and counties where the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has sentinel surveillance sites for influenza-like activity that is done every year, according to Vaid. Vaid said last year’s flu season data were not skewed by misidentifying COVID-19 as the flu. “When people go to see their doctors for flu-like illness, they are being tested for the respiratory panel, which includes flu as well,” Vaid said. “So, if that would have been the case, then [people] would have been diagnosed.” Doctor’s office visits for influenza-like illness (ILI), or the flu, also decreased across all age groups during this flu season compared to last season.Source: Illinois Department of Public Health Although influenza is not a reportable disease in Illinois, the public health department examines reports from health care sites statewide. “These sites include physician offices, emergency departments, and other clinics that report acute illness with influenza-like illness, and institutional settings such as nursing homes and prisons that report outbreaks,” the website states. “Accordingly, IDPH monitors disease trends and influenza activities as they occur on a weekly basis.” The Champaign region began to experience a decrease in flu activity in January at 1.0%. Its lowest activity rate was in March at 0.5%. Vaid said there was one death in 2019, and three deaths in 2020 in Champaign County related to the flu. The Champaign region of Illinois (orange line) began decreasing around week 1 of the current flu season in early January 2021. The lowest rate so far was during week 9 in early March 2021. Christopher Brooke, professor of microbiology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, said the benefits of getting vaccinated against COVID-19 are gaining attention. He said that the flu has been controlled due to vaccination. “The age profile of people who are dying, is starting to lower and that’s because the first people to get vaccinated were those who are most vulnerable due to age,” Brooke said. “And so we are now seeing the benefits of that and lowered mortality rates amongst, you know, older people, because so many of them have been vaccinated.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) flu vaccine distribution numbers indicate more people got vaccinated near the start of this flu season compared to the previous one. By the first week of March, around 194 million people in the U.S. got a flu vaccine this season, while only around 175 million did last season. According to CDC data, about half of the U.S. population gets vaccinated for the flu. Vaid said continuing to social distance, using face masks and disinfecting items will help prevent both flu and COVID-19. A healthy food diet and exercise can also help, according to Vaid. Yet, Vaid said it is to be determined whether or not the activity will remain the same for the upcoming flu season. “If all the preventive measures that people have been taking continue, then we should see a reduction in the number of cases,” Vaid said. “The one other concern that scientists also have is viruses compete for dominance. Flu was not able to dominate this year.” Leave a ReplyCancel reply Home About Us Contact Us Privacy Policy Donate This website uses cookies to improve your experience.

Scientists have to constantly monitor strains and select which ones will be included in the flu vaccine each year.In this articleBNTXPFEFollow your favorite stocksCREATE FREE ACCOUNTKathrin Jansen, Pfizer Inc, poses for a portrait in one of her labs in Pearl River, New York.Carlo Allegri | ReutersThe mRNA technology used to develop the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine could also help create "more potent" seasonal flu shots, Kathrin Jansen, head of Pfizer's vaccine research and development, told CNBC.How well flu vaccines work can vary from season to season. But generally, flu inoculations reduce the risk of illness from influenza viruses by between 40% and 60%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Jansen said the reason why flu vaccine effectiveness varies is due to the fact that influenza viruses are always changing and a strain that was common in a previous season may not be as prevalent in the next. Scientists have to constantly monitor strains and select which ones will be included in the flu vaccine each year.Sometimes scientists make selections that don't match well, Jansen said. But with the flexibility of mRNA technology, scientists could quickly "pivot" and adjust the flu vaccine to match the more dominant strain, she said.More CNBC health coverageFTC sues drug middlemen for allegedly inflating insulin pricesPfizer says drug for deadly cancer condition that causes weight loss shows positive trial dataGilead says its twice-yearly shot cut HIV infections by 96% in trial"I think the great success of the mRNA vaccines in addressing Covid-19 has clearly opened up a large number of possibilities," Jansen said in comments that aired Tuesday during CNBC's Healthy Returns Summit."We want to have better vaccines for older individuals" who are at risk for severe disease, she said in the interview with CNBC's Meg Tirrell. "This is in my mind a very powerful approach to get us to ultimately more potent seasonal influenza vaccines."watch nowVIDEO0:0000:00Why mRNA technologies are a 'significant' developmentSquawk Box EuropeJansen's comments come after Pfizer had huge success with its mRNA-based Covid-19 vaccine.Messenger RNA, or mRNA, technology has been under development for years, but Pfizer's and Moderna's Covid-19 vaccines are the first time mRNA has been cleared for use in humans. The mRNA-based Covid vaccine works by tricking the body to produce a harmless piece of the virus, triggering an immune response. It's said to be easier to produce over traditional vaccines, which generally use a dead or weakened virus to produce an immune response.Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech announced plans to develop a coronavirus vaccine in March of last year and submitted an application to the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization in November.The two-dose vaccine, given three weeks apart, was found in a clinical trial to be about 95% effective.In releasing its first-quarter earnings report last week, Pfizer said it expects full-year sales of $26 billion from the vaccine, up from its previous forecast of about $15 billion. It expects an adjusted pretax profit in the high 20% range of revenue for the vaccine.Pfizer executives told investors that they also hope to make improvements over current flu vaccines. They said given the strong immune response for the Covid-19 vaccine, they hope it will be the same for an mRNA-based flu vaccine. Rival Moderna is also working on a flu vaccine using mRNA technology.Stay connected with Healthy ReturnsFor a front row seat at CNBC Events, you can hear directly from the visionary executives, innovators, leaders and influencers taking the stage in "The Keynote Podcast."

Image: National Museum of Health and Medicine, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Washington DC, United States/Wikimedia CommonsWe may be drinking at home to ease the mental and emotional fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, but in 1918, during the deadliest pandemic in modern history, people with the Spanish flu were prescribed whisky for medical benefits. Doctors, frontline workers and flu patients drank the water of life to prevent, and cure, the deadly flu.Nearly a year after the first wave of the Spanish flu hit India, an article in The Times of India in April 1919 reported that scientists recommended whisky for flu patients "not only as a stimulant but a sedative too. It induces a sense of well-being and freedom from anxiety, which is certainly a help in resisting infection". The same piece also observed, "The demand for an increased issue of whisky emanates from those who would use sickness and death rate as an additional argument in favour of a relaxation. If whisky's sale is permitted, it is certain that much of it will be consumed for other than purely therapeutic purposes."US Navy nurse Josie Mabel Brown recalled serving in 1918 at the Naval Station Great Lakes near Chicago: "There were so many patients we didn't have time to treat them. We didn't take temperatures; we didn't even have time to take blood pressure. We would give them a little hot whiskey toddy; that's about all we had time to do. They would have terrific nosebleeds with it. Some were delirious and some had their lungs punctured. Then their bodies would fill with air. You would see them with bubbles all through their arms. Oh, it was a horrid thing. We had to wear operating masks and gowns all the time. It was 16 hours a day until the epidemic was over. It was March 1919 when I got sick. I ran a temperature of 104 or 105 degrees for days. They put an ice cap on my head, an ice collar on my neck, and an ice pack over my heart. There were 173,000 men at Great Lakes at the time, and 6,000 were in the hospitals at the height of the epidemic. I suppose no one knows how many died. They just lost track of them."Nurse wearing a cloth mask at Walter Reed Hospital, Washington DC, USA. Photo: Harris & Ewing via Library of Congress/Wikimedia Commons Research today observes that knocking back a glass or two per day won't hamper the healthy but, as this Insider piece notes , binge-drinking and excessive consumption of alcohol weakens the immune system; mixing alcohol and painkillers can cause gastrointestinal distress like ulcers and bleeding, and drinks can hamper recovery from an infection or illness.The Spanish flu claimed 3-5% of the world's population, estimated between 50-100 million lives, between 1918 and 1920—by when people the world over had developed immunity to the H1N1 virus. "The descendants of the 1918 virus remain today; as endemic influenza viruses, they cause significant mortality each year," write David Morens and Jeffery Taubenberger in their paper "The mother of all pandemics is 100 years old (and going strong!)". The virus had "silently seeded around the world, obscuring its place of origin" until it reached pandemicity between July and September 1918. Good nursing care and protective isolation of the ill helped address the Spanish flu but over time, a gene swap could enable a viral strain to switch hosts and become deadly. Pandemics since 1918, such as 2009's swine flu, have been viral progeny of the Spanish flu, which in turn had a bird flu viral ancestor. SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, is genetically closely related to the bat-borne coronavirus that induced 2002's SARS epidemic.When the 1918 pandemic broke out, many countries were focused on World War I. Spain, being a neutral country during the war, didn't have the same media censorship on revealing the toll of the pandemic on its manpower; even the king acknowledged being infected. Though it didn't originate in Spain, the early reportage led to the name Spanish flu.Cultural historian and professor Maggie Andrews notes in this podcast that the effect on the homefront in England "was absolutely monumental, because all the priority was on men involved in war work, there were not enough doctors left, there were not enough gravediggers left, there were not enough undertakers left, there were not enough vicars left, not enough nurses to look after a pandemic like this."Newspaper boy wearing a mask outside a closed theatre in Seattle, USA, in 1918.

The drink had long been used to stave off the cold and in the medical community, as anaesthesia during surgery. In the US , where several states had passed Prohibition laws, residents wrote to the authorities asking for whiskey to be made available strictly as medicine, and eventually, confiscated whiskey was used to treat flu patients in military and civilian hospitals. A liquor dealer in Syracuse was quoted in a 1918 newspaper report: "We have sold more than three times the amount of whisky since the epidemic began. They take it with yeast cakes, with soda, with quinine and with a dozen other things, and some take it straight. Some of our customers say physicians have advised the use of whisky and others say their friends have used it with good results. A great many people who never bought a glass of whisky over the bar in their lives or took it at any time for beverage purposes, are taking it now." (Incidentally, the Anti-Mask League formed in 1919 to protest the enforcement of mask-wearing in San Francisco, which would become one of the worst-affected major cities in the US.)Across the ocean in Scotland, newspaper The Southern Reporter observed in October 1918: "the very considerable reduction of sugar and fat in the national diet has weakened the power of resistance of the individual… the whisky drinker says the seat of the trouble is the scarcity of his favourite spirit; across the Border some allege that the poor and thin quality of the beer is at the bottom of it."In Ireland, which lost nearly as many to the pandemic as to the war, whiskey was used to cure patients and also as a preventative by doctors and workers who had to move bodies. Social historian Ida Milne noted a family in Dublin where the father kept the teenage son "constantly mildly drunk with whiskey until he pulled through". She adds that a medical doctor hearing of the story suggested that "small doses of whiskey might help prevent...cytokine storms, where the immune system overreacts". Another survivor, when he was five years old, "had his first taste of whiskey, in a hot toddy—made from sugar, whiskey and hot water—a taste he said he continued to enjoy for the rest of his life."TopicsWHISKYMore from Condé Nast Traveller IndiaFood & DrinkWho voted for India’s top 50 restaurants this year?By Condé Nast TravellerPeople & CultureIn Nepal, Diwali is a time to worship the dogsBy Shradha ShahaniFood & Drink9 culinary pop-ups to sign up for this month in Mumbai, Bengaluru, Delhi, Pune and JodhpurBy Karina AcharyaFood & Drink20 culinary pop-ups to sign up for this month in Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Goa and PuneBy Karina AcharyaDestinationsBest places to visit in India this DecemberBy Karina AcharyaHotels & HomestaysThis homestay near Tadoba National Park brings the jungle to your doorstepBy Kyra Kewalramani Amin FacebookInstagramXYouTubeConnect with Condé Nast Traveller IndiaContact UsTeamCareersTerms and ConditionsAssociated SitesArchitectural Digest IndiaGQ IndiaVogue India© 2024 Condé Nast.
