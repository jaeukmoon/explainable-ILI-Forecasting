BARDA will leverage existing infrastructures and capabilities to respond to the current Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 threat while continuing to establish new capabilities to improve rapid response to both the current H5N1 virus and other potential pandemic influenza viruses in the future. This strategy outlines BARDA’s objectives for enabling a successful HHS response to H5N1. BARDA has grouped the strategy into four objectives, each with current activities and future priorities: Objectives: Objective 1: Strategic implementation and deployment of the U.S. National Pre-pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile (NPIVS). Objective 2: Enhanced protection through novel vaccines against pandemic influenza. Objective 3: Leverage therapeutics through deployment, early availability, and development of novel products. Objective 4: Ensure rapid and effective diagnostics tools to inform rapid antiviral prescription and treatment. BARDA’s activities are a part of a larger HHS influenza research strategy and are a regular aspect of ASPR’s preparedness responsibilities. The agency’s mission is to assist the country in preparing for, responding to, and recovering from public health emergencies and disasters. ASPR has subject matter experts available to discuss the agenda in greater detail upon request.

They circulate with seasonal predictability and occasional devastation, so it is easy to forget that most influenza A viruses are not human pathogens. Their natural reservoir is wild birds. The species promiscuity of the emerging avian influenza A virus (H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b offers new insights into an ancient pathogen. Read About the History of Avian Influenza Where Did Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Clade 2.3.4.4b Come From? Identified in Wild Birds in 2020 Influenza A (H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b has been circulating at least since 2020 in wild birds in Europe, Asia and Africa. Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based evidence placed its arrival in wild birds in North America in late 2021, with detection in U.S. commercial poultry flocks by February 2022. It is not unusual for avian influenza viruses (AIVs) to migrate with wild birds. Their diversity and global movement are monitored by the WHO’s Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System. A Surprising Spillover With High Mortality in Wildlife Humboldt penguins infected with avian influenza virus (H5N1) have experienced an especially high mortality rate. Source: Daniel Figueroa/Animalia Bio. But in early 2023, ecologists and marine biologists sounded an alarm after especially high mortality was observed to be associated with this particular virus in endangered species, like the Peruvian pelican and the Humboldt penguin, in the Southern Cone of Latin America. Concerns escalated as the virus was detected in an increasing number of diverse species, devastating populations of sea mammals, like the South American sea lion and the elephant seal. The number of unique species infected has since increased to over 500, including 48 mammalian species and counting. Appearance in Dairy Cattle In February 2024, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA's) national network of veterinarians began discussing an unusual illness affecting dairy cattle in Texas. Lactating adult cows seemed to be most affected, becoming suddenly ill with nonspecific symptoms. Sick cows ate less, and their milk production dropped dramatically, but they typically recovered within a couple of weeks. By March, farms from 2 other states reported similar illnesses in their herds. Molecular testing by RT-PCR detected influenza A (H5N1) in milk, later confirmed to belong to clade 2.3.4.4b. This event is the first time an influenza virus was known to spillover into cows. How Did H5N1 Spillover Into Cows? Pathogen, Host and Environmental Factors Must Align A spillover requires a pathogen that can infect a new host, a host that is susceptible to passing on the infection and the circumstances that bring them together. Collaborative investigations between local veterinarians, public health professionals and federal officials have begun to paint a picture of how these events might have played out in the case of influenza A (H5N1). The airspace over Texas is a nexus for 2 major flyways for migratory birds in which clade 2.3.4.4b was circulating. Typical dairy operations in the U.S. provide opportunities for inter-species interactions; many barns have open windows, and cows’ feed is attractive to birds. Additionally, free-range dairy cows share space with commercial poultry that may have been exposed to an avian virus and with small mammals, like barn cats or skunks, that prey on wild birds. AIVs replicate in the guts of infected birds and are shed in their droppings, which cows could ingest through grazing or eating contaminated feed. Preliminary testing has found evidence of the virus in the stomachs and nasal swabs from infected cows. Once the virus entered the herd, cows were not primed to slow its spread. They do not have any natural immunity to AIV, and there is no bovine vaccine. Furthermore, cows spend most of their time grouped together and sharing milking equipment, food and water—a situation that lends itself to disease transmission. A Single Transmission Event Into Cattle May Have Sparked the Current Outbreak Typical dairy operations in the U.S. provide opportunities for inter-species interactions between birds and cattle, which could facilitate transmission of H5N1. Source: Wikimedia Commons. By March 2024, the virus had been detected in cows in 8 other states. Was each instance a new spillover event, or were infected herds spreading the virus to other cows? Scientists at the National Veterinary Service Laboratories in Ames, Iowa turned to NGS to find out (the generated sequences are now publicly available). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the viruses from cows were similar to viruses in local wild bird populations, but most similar to each other. This is a pattern that would be expected from a single zoonotic spillover followed by onward transmission within the herd, instead of multiple introductions. Evolutionary modeling estimated that the original introduction from birds to cows could have happened as early as Dec. 2023 with the virus quietly circulating for months. The same analysis found that the genetic distance in viral sequences from different states mirrors known inter-state movements of cows. By early May 2024, the CDC had reported that 2 dairy workers from Texas and Michigan, respectively, tested positive for the same virus. Both cases experienced only eye irritation and were discovered through active monitoring for unusual symptoms. AIV can cause a range of illness in people, from a mild “cold” to severe or even fatal pneumonia requiring hospitalization. Both patients rapidly received treatment with the antiviral oseltamivir and recovered uneventfully. These were the first cases in which a spillover of this virus into humans from a mammal was implicated. Preliminary NGS analysis of the viruses from the first 2 human cases showed more similarity to virus from infected cows than from wild birds. Symptoms in the eyes, rather than respiratory symptoms, may reflect the exposure route of the dairy workers to the virus, either through touching the eyes after handling infectious milk or other materials in the barn, or through the milking process. A third case, also from a farm worker in Michigan, is now the first to report both eye discomfort and typical respiratory symptoms after working closely with sick cows.

Our understanding of the factors necessary for AIVs to replicate in mammals is incomplete. Several genomic hallmarks of host adaptation are routinely monitored globally. These data are integrated with ecological, public health and population level information to evaluate the pandemic risk of new viruses, e.g. WHO’s Tool for Influenza Pandemic Risk Assessment (TIPRA) and CDC’s Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT). Potential risk elements defined by the IRAT and TIPRA have been assessed and weighted in order to estimate emergence and impact risks for prepandemic influenza strains. (Click image for larger view.) Source: Harrington, W.N. et al./Experimental & Molecular Medicine volume, May 2021. The viral requirements for spillover and effective onward spread between mammals has been the subject of critical, yet contentious research and requires careful study in animal models of respiratory transmission. Specific mutations on several gene segments (some of which are described below) influence host adaptation, and it is likely that multiple substitutions are required for spillover to occur. Coinfection and Reassortment Furthermore, it is common for multiple influenza viruses to co-circulate, and reassortment, the shuffling of gene segments between influenza viruses during a coinfection of the same host, can accelerate the adaptation process. For this reason, classification of influenza viruses is both scientifically important and practical. Laboratory characterization was historically based on serological studies; viruses were grouped based on distinct patterns of reactivity with red blood cells that we now know are attributable to the 2 major viral structural proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA)—hence the H5N1 subtype. However, subtyping provides limited information about a virus’s ability to cause disease. AIV’s can also be classified as either “high pathogenicity” or “low pathogenicity" viruses (HPAI or LPAI) based on the extent to which they cause illness in domestic poultry. The virus that spilled into cows in Texas was likely the product of a reassortment event in birds between a LPAI virus and a HPAI virus. The resulting virus, dubbed genotype B3.13, inherited an influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) gene previously linked to increased transmission in commercial swine. Changes in Receptor-Binding Domain A key determinant of host range is a virus’ ability to bind to target cells. The HA protein of AIVs preferentially binds to glycoproteins with terminal sialic acids linked by an α2,3 linkage to the rest of the oligosaccharide chain, whereas the HA protein of viruses routinely circulating in humans preferentially binds a terminal α2,6 linkage. This preference mirrors the difference in relative abundance of each type of linkage between the avian digestive tract and the human upper respiratory tract. Both genomic and phenotypic studies from sequencing the HA gene and laboratory binding studies of the viral HA protein, respectively, of a virus isolate from the Texas outbreak showed no evidence of this virus developing a preference for the “human-like” receptors. However, sequences of viral isolates from infected dairy cattle and cats sporadically revealed some mutations known to influence binding affinity to the human-type receptor, underscoring the importance of continued monitoring. Mutations to Viral Polymerase Host adaptation also depends on viral polymerase activity in mammalian cells. Specifically, mutations in position 66 of the polymerase subunit PB1 and at 591, 627 and 701 of the subunit PB2 protein are associated with high pathogenicity in birds and required for efficient replication in non-avian hosts. Sequences from infected elephant seals in Argentina in 2023 carried some of these mutations. These polymerase gene mutations were absent in the sequences from sick dairy cows and cats in Texas but, concerningly, the E627K substitution was observed in the sequence of the Texas human case. Its origin is unclear. It is possible that it emerged during replication in the patient, particularly since it has not been observed from available sequences from wild birds or from commercial poultry in the region. Other Key Genomic Changes The viral NA protein is important for the efficient release of new viruses from an infected cell and is, therefore, a target of licensed antivirals. Analysis of available N1 sequences has not detected a mutation associated with antiviral resistance at position 275 from dairy cows, wild birds or human cases. Similarly, mutations in other gene segments associated with antiviral resistance have not been detected. What's Next? Raw milk may contain infectious virus, but authorities suggest that standard industrial pasteurization processes are adequate to inactivate H5N1. Source: iStock.com/SimonSkafar. Critical questions remain, ranging from the academic to the practical. Agricultural workers remain at the highest risk of exposure to this virus, and the risk to the general public is low. How can dairy workers best be protected? Why does this virus appear at high titers in the mammary tissue of cows? How best can milk be decontaminated, and what does this mean for our food supply? Early evidence from federal authorities suggests that standard industrial pasteurization processes are adequate to inactivate any virus present in retail milk and milk products; they continue to advise against the consumption of raw milk and products prepared with raw milk, as it may contain infectious virus. Officials have advised that cooking beef to safe internal temperatures would also inactivate any virus in the unlikely event that it is present. What is the primary mechanism of transmission between cows, and how can it be stopped? Is a genome reassortment event required for spillover of avian origin viruses to mammals, and how does this virus’ unusual propensity to transmit to diverse species impact risk for human health? Can we leverage new data from wastewater testing for influenza A virus to inform public health, agricultural and wildlife conservation actions? Foundational laboratory test methods, like viral culture, serology and animal studies, will be critical to address these questions, as will continued investment in our public health infrastructure. Although recent data suggest that the Texas outbreak-associated viruses are not able to spread efficiently by respiratory transmission in mammals, influenza viruses have a seemingly limitless capacity to surprise us. NGS provided clues to guide our growing understanding of this new threat, and genomic surveillance will be necessary for our continued preparedness. This is an emerging situation.

Most licensed influenza and recently licensed RSV vaccines are administered via the intramuscular route. Alternative immunisation strategies, such as intranasal vaccinations, and “prime-pull” regimens, may deliver a more sterilising form of protection against respiratory viruses. A bivalent ChAdOx1-based vaccine (ChAdOx1-NP + M1-RSVF) encoding conserved nucleoprotein and matrix 1 proteins from influenza A virus and a modified pre-fusion stabilised RSV A F protein, was designed, developed and tested in preclinical animal models. The aim was to induce broad, cross-protective tissue-resident T cells against heterotypic influenza viruses and neutralising antibodies against RSV in the respiratory mucosa and systemically. When administered via an intramuscular prime-intranasal boost (IM-IN) regimen in mice, superior protection was generated against challenge with either RSV A, Influenza A H3N2 or H1N1. These results support further clinical development of a pan influenza & RSV vaccine administered in a prime-pull regimen.

Upper respiratory tract (URT) immunity to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus has been shown to protect against viral infection and disease1,2,3,4,5. Tissue-resident memory T and B cells (TRM and BRM), as well as neutralising IgA within the upper respiratory tract, contribute to rapid response and control of viral infection at the site of viral entry6. Standard intramuscular (IM) administration, used for most licensed influenza vaccines and the recently licensed RSV vaccines, is known to be protective against disease. However, IM vaccination is largely ineffective at stimulating the mucosal immune compartment7,8,9. Both clinical and preclinical studies have shown that delivering influenza and RSV vaccines via mucosal routes better induces mucosal immunity and correlates well with protection10,11,12,13,14,15,16.Considerable progress has been made in determining the best antigenic candidates for RSV and influenza vaccines. RSV’s fusion protein (RSVF) is conserved across viral subtypes, and has a critical role in mediating virus-host membrane fusion17,18. RSVF is metastable in its prefusion form and can spontaneously convert into a more stable postfusion form, which conceals epitopes targeted by potently neutralising antibodies (NAbs)19,20,21. Stabilised prefusion forms of RSVF protein have been shown to better induce NAbs compared with postfusion forms of RSVF19,22. Modified, stabilised RSVF antigen is now used in a number of vaccines that have demonstrated efficacy against RSV respiratory tract infection and/or disease, including vaccines from GSK, Pfizer and Moderna23.The ability of traditional seasonal influenza candidate vaccines to induce hemagglutinin-inhibiting antibodies as measured via hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) is a determining factor for their licensure24. Predictions of the identity of the next-season circulating strain(s), and subsequent updates of last-season vaccines, are completed such that protective NAbs should be induced by the vaccine; this process is costly and not always effective as mismatch frequently occurs25. Alternative vaccine approaches have been tested at the preclinical and clinical stage; some of which aim to induce different forms of protection, and that deviate from HAI-based strategies. One approach focuses on conserved antigens, e.g., nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix 1 (M1), with the aim of inducing CD8+ T cell populations that are broadly reactive to different influenza A subtypes26,27. By facilitating rapid clearance of the virus within the URT, NP- and M1-specific T cells are thought to limit virus infection and lessen disease severity10,27.A suitable vector for the delivery and expression of influenza NP and M1 T cell antigens, and RSV F B cell antigen, is adenovirus ChAdOx1. The safety profile and immunogenicity of this platform has been well-studied for vaccines against various pathogens, including SARS-CoV-228,29,30,31,32. IM immunisation with ChAdOx1 has been used in global vaccination schemes, and this vaccine technology can be administered safety via the mucosal intranasal (IN) route7,33. Additionally, it can be modified to express multiple antigenic sequences facilitating immunity to multiple pathogens through one vaccine dose.This study aimed to assess the immunogenicity and protective capacity of ChAdOx1-NP + M1-RSVF, a bivalent ChAdOx1 viral vector vaccine, against influenza virus and RSV infection and disease. ChAdOx1-NP + M1-RSVF incorporates the pre-F RSV antigen and influenza nucleoprotein and matrix 1 antigens. We specifically investigated the impact of mucosal and systemic vaccine delivery on the immunogenicity and protective response against challenge with virus RSV A, as well as influenza A viruses H3N2 and H1N1. We demonstrate that an intramuscular prime-intranasal boost combination gave the best protection against infection with all three viruses.ResultsIM-IN vaccination elicits superior antigen-specific antibody response in the blood and respiratory mucosaChAdOx1-NP + M1-RSVF was constructed by inserting antigenic sequences within the ChAdOx1 backbone. A pre-fusion-stabilised RSV A2-F (DS2) sequence was inserted at the E4-deleted gene site, and a sequence encoding H3N2 NP and M1 proteins, attached to each other by a flexible linker, were inserted at the E1-deleted gene site.ChAdOx1 vaccines previously tested at preclinical and clinical level can induce protection against infection and disease when administered in a single-dose or two-dose, prime-boost regimen. We tested a variety of prime-only and prime-boost regimens involving IM and/or IN routes of vaccination, to determine which regimens induced both systemic, and respiratory mucosal immune responses to RSV and influenza A antigens and optimal immunogenicity. An outbred (CD-1) mouse strain was selected, such that immune responses to vaccination better represented an outbred population as is similar to humans.Three weeks after the final vaccination the levels of IgG, IgA and IgM specific to H1N1-NP, H1N1-M1, H3N2-NP, H3N2-M1 and RSV A2-F antigens were measured via ELISA in the serum of vaccinated mice (Fig. 1a, b and Supplementary Fig. 1a). Serum IgG titres against all antigens were detected (Fig. 1b). All prime-boost regimens induced higher IgG levels compared with prime-only regimens (Fig. 1b). Specifically, IM-IN and IN-IN regimens elicited significantly higher IgG titres than prime-only regimens; this finding was consistent across all three antigens (RSV A2-F, H1N1-NP and H1N1-M1) (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1a). IM-IN and IN-IN regimens also elicited between 2- and 5-fold higher log10 IgG ELISA units (EUs) than in IM-IM mice, however, these differences were not significant. IM-IM vaccination did not elicit significantly higher IgG titres in sera compared with prime-only groups. Increased antigen-specific IgA levels in serum were observed in IM-IN and IN-IN compared with IM and IM-IM, specific against RSV A2-F, H1N1-NP and H1N1-M1 (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1a).Fig. 1: Humoral immunogenicity of ChAdOx1-NP + M1-RSVF.a Vaccination schematic for the assessment of the immunogenicity of ChAdOx1-NP + M1-RSVF administered through different regimens in outbred, 5-week-old, CD-1 mice (n = 6). Mice were culled on day 50, with sera, lungs, spleens, nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) and bronchioalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) harvested. b IgG, IgA and IgM responses against RSV-F, influenza A NP and M1 (H1N1) in sera three weeks post-final vaccination, measured by ELISA. Values are displayed as ELISA units (EUs) (log10). Individual mouse values are represented as symbols. Values were analysed using non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests to assess for statistically significant differences between groups, which are then expressed as p values (*=p < 0.05, **=p < 0.01, ***=p < 0.001). c Levels of IgA specific to influenza A NP (H1N1) and RSVF in NALT, BALF and lung homogenate supernatant (LHS) collected from mice three weeks post-final vaccination as measured by ELISAs (*=p < 0.05, **=p < 0.01, ***=p < 0.001). d Relative levels of anti-influenza A NP (H1N1) and anti-RSVF IgG subclasses in serum (IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG2c and IgG3), as measured by tIgG-normalised indirect ELISA. Relative IgG subclass levels following each regimen are presented as individual doughnut charts, with each section of the doughnut representing the median IgG subclass OD405nm response. Bar charts with individual sample responses per subclass per regimen are present in Supplementary Fig. 3a. e Serum antigen-specific IgG2a to IgG1 subclass ratios (IgG2a OD405nm/IgG1 OD405nm). For all boxplots, whisker endings represent upper and lower extremes, the box bounds represent upper and lower quartiles, respectively, and the central line represents the group median.Full size imageTo assess mucosal antibody responses, respiratory fluid IgA specific to H1N1-NP (as the representative influenza A antigen) and RSV A2-F were tested (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 2a and b). Higher levels of H1N1 NP- and RSV A2 F-specific IgA in IM-IN and IN-IN were detected within nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT), broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung homogenate supernatant (LHS), compared with levels following IM and IM-IM vaccination (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 1b). The IN-IN regimen elicited the highest titres of IgA in NALT, BALF and LHS. IM-IN-vaccinated groups had IgA titres comparable to the IN-IN regimen in NALT, BALF and LHS.To assess if regimens elicited Th1 (increased relative IgG2a) or Th2 (increased relative IgG1) responses, the relative abundances of IgG subclasses specific to NP and RSVF antigens in serum were then assessed. IM, IM-IM and IM-IN regimens elicited high relative levels of IgG2a among subclasses, suggesting a Th1-type response (Fig. 1d and e)34. IN and IN-IN groups, however, did not elicit clear Th1-type IgG subclass responses, with reduced relative levels of IgG2a, and either balanced levels across all five subclasses (H1N1 NP-specific) or elevated IgG2b (RSVF-specific) (Fig. 1d).In summary, IM-IN and IN-IN regimens induced higher systemic and respiratory mucosal antibody responses against viral antigens compared with other regimens tested. However, IM-IN-vaccinated mice had a clear Th1-type systemic IgG subclass profile, whereas IN-IN-vaccinated mice possessed a mixed IgG subclass profile and IgG2b-dominant profile, for influenza NP-specific and RSVF-specific IgG, respectively.IM-IN vaccination prompts strong T-cell response and the generation of TRM in the lungsT-cell responses were measured in the spleen and lungs to determine the systemic and respiratory cellular responses, respectively. Antigen peptide stimulation and subsequent intracellular staining (ICS) of cytokines IFNγ, TNF, IL-4 and IL-2 was performed to determine the frequency of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells expressing each cytokine, and subsequent T cell phenotype (Fig. 2a).Fig. 2: Cellular immunogenicity of ChAdOx1-NP + M1-RSVF.a Cytokine responses in CD4+ and CD8+ splenocytes that were separately stimulated with influenza A (H1N1) NP + M1- and RSVF-spanning peptides; % cytokine+ T cells were determined through intracellular staining. Basal frequencies of cytokine+ T cells (unstimulated sample) were subtracted from stimulated sample frequencies. Median responses in each group are displayed as the top lines of bars on graphs on the left-hand side of the figure, with symbols representing individual mice, grey-shaded bars prime-boost regimens and white bars prime-only regimens. b Cytokine responses in CD4+ and CD8+ lung cells harvested from mice, separately stimulated with influenza A (H1N1) NP + M1- and RSVF-spanning peptides. c Vaccination schematic for the continued assessment of the cellular immunogenicity of ChAdOx1-NP + M1-RSVF. d IFNγ responses in splenocytes stimulated with NP + M1- and RSVF-spanning peptides (IFNγ spot-forming cells (SFCs)/million splenocytes), as measured by IFNγ enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assay. e Total counts of CD8+ TRM cells (left), as well as relative counts of CD8+ TEM and TRM cells (right) in lungs post-vaccination (all non-antigen-specific). TRM cells were defined as CD8+CD44+CD62L-CD103+CD69+, and negative for intravenous (IV) circulatory CD3+ T cell stain. TEM cells were defined as CD8+CD44+CD62L-CD127+, and negative for IV circulatory CD3+ T cell stain. Group differences of data in (a), (b), (d) and (e) were analysed using non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests (*=p < 0.05, **=p < 0.01, ***=p < 0.001). For all boxplots, whisker endings represent upper and lower extremes, the box bounds represent upper and lower quartiles, respectively, and the central line represents the group median.Full size imageSplenocytes were stimulated with NP and M1 peptides, and following IM-IN vaccination, CD4+s demonstrated a trend of highest levels of IFNγ and TNF production and minimal IL-4 and IL-2, compared with other regimens (Fig. 2a). RSVF-stimulated splenocytes of IN- and IN-IN-vaccinated mice had strikingly higher levels of IL-2 staining in CD4+ cells compared with IM and IM-IM regimen CD4+ cells (IN > IM and IN-IN > IM, P = 0.0082 and P = 0.0297, respectively). Relative levels of staining of other cytokines IFNγ, TNF and IL-4, however, remained statistically comparable between regimens following RSVF peptide stimulation.Following NP and M1 peptide stimulation, CD8+ splenocytes had a trend across all regimens of minimal IL-4 and IL-2 expression, and higher levels of IFNγ and TNF, which were highest following the IM-IN regimen (Fig. 2a). Following RSVF peptide stimulation, CD8+ splenocytes following IM-IN mirrored this trend. Trends in expression following other regimens (IM, IN, IM-IM and IN-IN) were not detected.Cytokine-positive responses were detected in CD4+ and CD8+ lung cells to varying degrees (Fig. 2b). Lung CD4+s and CD8+s of IM-IN-vaccinated mice expressed the highest levels of IFNγ, TNF and IL-4 following NP- and M1-peptide stimulation, although these differences were not statistically significant (Fig. 2b). Notably, lung cell cytokine responses following IN-IN vaccination were generally low compared with other regimens. Overall, measured lung CD4+ and CD8+ T cell cytokine responses had a mixed profile post-peptide-stimulation.Splenocyte IFNγ release following peptide stimulation was also assessed through IFNγ ELISpot assay, in a repeated experiment focussing on IM-IM, IM-IN and IN-IN regimens (Fig. 2c and d). Following RSVF peptide stimulation, IM-IM- and IM-IN-vaccinated mouse splenocytes released comparable levels of IFNγ that were statistically higher than control, unvaccinated mice (P = 0.0057 and P = 0.0065, IM-IM>unvaccinated control and IM-IN>unvaccinated control, respectively) (Fig. 2d). Following NP + M1 peptide stimulation, IM-IM, IM-IN and IN-IN mouse group splenocytes all released higher levels of IFNγ compared with unvaccinated control (P = 0.0256, P = 0.0100, P = 0.0291, IM-IM>unvaccinated control, IM-IN>unvaccinated control, and IN-IN>unvaccinated control, respectively) (Fig. 2d).Total numbers of lung tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) were measured via antibody staining and flow cytometry. TRM were defined as expressing a CD3IV-CD69+CD103+CD62L-CD44+ phenotype, where anti-CD3 antibody was intravenously (IV) injected into mice to exclude all circulatory T cells (Fig. 2e). Lung CD8+ TRM counts were highest following IM-IN vaccination (IM-IN > IM-IM, P = 0.0197 and IM-IN>unvaccinated control, P = 0.0005). IN-IN vaccinated mice had TRM counts lower than IM-IN, but that were still higher than unvaccinated control mice (IN-IN>unvaccinated control, P = 0.0197). Additionally, TEM (CD3IV-CD44+CD62L-CD127+) counts were highest following IM-IN vaccination (Fig. 2e).Overall magnitudes of T cell cytokine responses tended to be higher in IM-IN-vaccinated groups both systemically in the spleen and locally in the lung. In the spleen, these responses were generally IFNγ and TNF biased, whereas in the lungs a mixed cytokine profile was detected. IM-IM- and IM-IN-vaccinated mouse splenocytes also released high levels of IFNγ as measured by ELISpot assay. The IM-IN regimen was able to potentiate higher counts of TRM and TEM in the lungs compared with other regimens. A summary of the magnitude of the immune response following the reach regimen is represented through a normalised heatmap in Supplementary Fig. 4a.IM-IN and IN-IN immunisation best protect against RSV infection and diseaseThe level of protection against RSV following IM-IM, IM-IN or IN-IN ChAdOx1-NP + M1-RSVF vaccination regimen was assessed via challenge. 5-week-old BALB/c mice were vaccinated, and then challenged IN with 7.7 × 105 PFU RSV-A2 21 days-post boost (Fig. 3a).Fig. 3: Challenging ChAdOx1-NP + M1-RSVF-vaccinated mice with RSV.a Vaccination and challenge schematic for the assessment of the protective capacity of ChAdOx1-NP + M1-RSVF against RSV-A2 infection. Mice were prime-boost-vaccinated, then challenged with RSV-A2, and culled 7 days later with tissues and fluids harvested. Blood sampling was performed 4 weeks post-prime and 3 weeks post-boost. b Weight change in mice over time post-challenge, measured as % of pre-challenge weight. At each timepoint, lines represent group medians, and bars represent group bodyweight ranges. Significant differences between IM-IN and control groups are represented with *, between IM-IM and control as & (* or & =p < 0.05, **=p < 0.01). c Viral load in lungs 7 days post-challenge, measured as number of RSV L gene copies/μg lung RNA (log10). d RSVF-specific IgG and IgA levels in serum, NWs, BALF and LHS post-challenge, measured by ELISA. Median negative control values are displayed as dashed lines. e Levels of antigen-specific CD8+ TRM, and relative levels of antigen-specific CD8+ TEM and TRM, in BAL and lungs post-challenge. TRM and TEM cells were defined as CD3+CD8+CD44+CD62L-CD103+CD69+, and CD3+CD8+CD44+CD62L-, respectively, and positive for RSV pentamer H-2Kd KYKNVTEL. In boxplots, a “+” symbol represents the group mean. Two mice from the IM-IM-vaccinated group did not have detectable BAL or lung TRM. Group differences for all data were analysed using non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests (*=p < 0.05, **=p < 0.01). For all figure boxplots, whisker endings represent upper and lower extremes, the box bounds represent upper and lower quartiles, respectively, and the central line represents the group median.Full size imageWeight loss was measured daily in mice post-challenge as a measure of deteriorating health and disease. All vaccinated mice, irrespective of regimen, followed a trend of less weight loss compared with unvaccinated, then challenged, control mice (Fig. 3b). Weight loss between days 4 and 7 post-infection within the IM-IN-vaccinated group was significantly less when compared with the control group (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Table 2a and Supplementary Fig. 5a). No significant differences in weight loss were measured between immunisation regimens. To assess the degree of viral replication in the respiratory tract, lung RSV viral loads were measured after mice were culled on day 7. IM-IN and IN-IN-vaccinated mice had statistically lower viral loads within lungs compared with unvaccinated, challenged controls (P = 0.0166 and P = 0.0055, IM-IN>unvaccinated control and IN-IN>unvaccinated control, respectively) (Fig. 3c).Humoral antibody and cellular immune responses systemically and in the respiratory tract were assessed on day 7 of the challenge. IgG and IgA antibodies against RSV A2-F were detected above the control baseline in all regimens in serum 7 days post-challenge (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 6a). Within nasal washes (NWs), BALF and LHS, IN-IN-vaccinated mice had significantly higher titres of IgG and IgA compared with IM-IM-vaccinated mice post-challenge, whilst IM-IN-vaccinated mice had intermediate values between such regimens (Supplementary Table 3a).Total counts of TRM (defined as CD3+CD69+CD103+CD62L-CD44+, and H-2Kd KYKNVTEL+) in BAL and lungs were measured. Overall counts of BAL and lung CD8+ TRM within all vaccinated, challenged groups were higher than unvaccinated, challenged control sample levels (Fig. 3e). Levels of tissue-resident CD8+ T cells of BAL and lung were of statistically insignificant difference between regimens, and only IN-IN-vaccinated mice demonstrated statistically higher levels compared with unvaccinated control (P = 0.0134 in BAL cells and P = 0.0028 in lung cells) (Fig. 3e). Nevertheless, IM-IN and IN-IN regimens had BAL and lung TRM levels of much smaller range compared with IM-IM-vaccinated mice; IM-IM vaccinated mice had larger ranges of values, and two mice with TRM levels below the limit of detection. All vaccinated, RSV-challenged mice contained numbers of TEM CD8+ T cells similar level to naïve, challenged mice in BAL and lungs.All vaccinated animals were protected from overt disease with IM-IN and IN-IN immunised mice having a significant reduction of lung viral load following the RSV challenge.IM-IN and IN-IN immunisation best protect against H3N2 infection and diseaseThe level of protection against influenza A subtype H3N2 following IM-IM, IM-IN or IN-IN ChAdOx1-NP + M1-RSVF vaccination regimen was assessed via challenge. BALB/c mice were vaccinated, and then challenged IN with 2 × 105 PFU influenza A X-31 21 days-post boost (Fig. 4a).Fig. 4: Challenging ChAdOx1-NP + M1-RSVF-vaccinated mice with H3N2.a Vaccination and challenge schematic for the assessment of the protective capacity of ChAdOx1-NP + M1-RSVF against X31 (H3N2) infection and subsequent disease in mice. Mice were prime-boost-vaccinated, then challenged with X31, and culled 6 days later with tissues and fluids harvested. Blood sampling was performed 4 weeks post-prime and 3 weeks post-boost. b Weight change in mice over time post-challenge, measured as % of pre-challenge weight. Significant differences at timepoints between IM-IN and control mouse groups are represented with *, between IM-IN and IM-IM as # and between IN-IN and unvaccinated as @ (*, @ or # =p < 0.05, **=p < 0.01). c Viral load in lungs 6 days post-challenge (M gene copies/μg lung RNA (log10)). d H3N2 NP-specific IgG and IgA levels in serum, NWs, BALF and LHS post-challenge, as measured by ELISA (log10 EU). Median negative control values are displayed as dashed lines. e Levels of antigen-specific CD8+ TRM cells, and relative levels of antigen-specific CD8+ TEM and TRM, in BAL and lungs post-challenge. TRM and TEM cells were defined as CD3+CD8+CD44+CD62L-CD103+CD69+, and CD3+CD8+CD44+CD62L-, respectively, and positive for influenza pentamer H-2Kd TYQRTALV. In boxplots, a “+” symbol represents the group mean. One mouse in group IM-IN did not have detectable Lung TRM. Group differences for all data were analysed using non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests (*=p < 0.05, **=p < 0.01). For all boxplots, whisker endings represent upper and lower extremes, the box bounds represent upper and lower quartiles, respectively, and the central line represents the group median.Full size imageAll vaccinated groups lost less weight than controls after the challenge. Mice vaccinated IM-IN or IN-IN, lost the least weight upon challenge (P = 0.0066 and P = 0.02332, IM-IN>unvaccinated control and IN-IN>unvaccinated control, respectively) (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 5b and Table 2b). IM-IM-vaccinated mice lost more weight, mirroring weight loss observed in unvaccinated, challenged control mice until day 4. Following day 4, IM-IM-vaccinated mouse weights began to recover until cull at day 6 post-challenge.All vaccinated, H3N2-challenged mice had less viral load in lungs (measured as M gene copy number/μg lung RNA) compared with unvaccinated, challenged control mice (Fig. 4c). Mice vaccinated with IM-IN and IN-IN regimens had statistically lower viral loads compared with unvaccinated control mice (P = 0.0037 and P = 0.0097, IM-IN>unvaccinated control and IN-IN>unvaccinated control, respectively), and viral loads were of a similar level across IM-IN and IN-IN regimens.Humoral antibody and cellular immune responses systemically and in the respiratory tract were assessed on day 6 of the challenge. Serum IgG and IgA antibodies against H3N2-NP were detected above baseline in all regimens (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 6b). Serum and airway IgG and IgA were significantly higher following IN-IN vaccination and challenge, than IM-IM vaccination and challenge, whilst IM-IN-vaccinated mice again had intermediate titres (Supplementary Table 3b).CD8+ TRM cells (defined as CD3+CD69+CD103+CD62L-CD44+, and H-2Kd TYQRTRALV+) were detected in BAL and lungs above the level in control, challenged animals in all vaccination regimens (Fig. 4e). In both BAL and lungs, IM-IN-vaccinated, challenged mice had the highest median TRM CD8+ T cell frequencies across immunisation regimens, and were significantly higher than in challenged control group (P = 0.0020 and P = 0.0101 for BAL and lung cells, respectively). One IM-IN-vaccinated mouse failed to generate detectable lung TRM CD8+ T cells following the challenge. Following all regimens, TEM cells could be detected in BAL and lungs (Fig. 4e).All vaccinated animals were protected from overt disease with viral titres being lower following IM-IN and IN-IN regimen than IM-IM and higher frequencies of a TRM population in the IM-IN-vaccinated groups post-H3N2 challenge.IM-IN immunisation provides some protection against H1N1 infectionThe level of protection against influenza A strain H1N1 following IM-IM, IM-IN or IN-IN ChAdOx1-NP + M1-RSVF vaccination regimen was assessed through challenge. 5-week-old BALB/c mice were vaccinated, and then challenged IN with 2.1 × 105 PFU influenza A H1N1 21 days-post boost (Fig. 5a).Fig. 5: Challenging ChAdOx1-NP + M1-RSVF-vaccinated mice with H1N1.a Vaccination and challenge schematic for the assessment of the protective capacity of ChAdOx1-NP + M1-RSVF against H1N1 infection and subsequent disease in mice. Mice were prime-boost-vaccinated, then challenged with H1N1, and culled 5 days later with tissues and fluids harvested. Blood sampling was performed 4 weeks post-priming and 3 weeks post-boosting. b Weight change in mice over time post-challenge, as measured by % of pre-challenge weight. The significant difference between IM-IN and IM-IM mouse groups is represented with ## (##=p < 0.01). c Viral load in lungs 5 days post-challenge (number of M gene copies/μg lung RNA (log10)). d H1N1 NP-specific IgG and IgA levels in serum, NWs, BALF and LHS post-challenge, as measured ELISA (log10 EU). Median control values are displayed as dashed lines on graphs. e Levels of antigen-specific CD8+ TRM cells, and relative levels of antigen-specific CD8+ TEM and TRM, in BAL and lungs post-challenge. TRM and TEM cells were defined as CD3+CD8+CD44+CD62L-CD103+CD69+, and CD3+CD8+CD44+CD62L-, respectively, and positive for influenza pentamer H-2Kd TYQRTALV. In boxplots, a “+” symbol represents the group mean. Two mice in group IM-IM did not have detectable BAL TRM, and one mouse in group IM-IM did not have detectable Lung TRM. Group differences for all data were analysed using non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests (*=p < 0.05, **=p < 0.01, ***=p < 0.001). For all boxplots, whisker endings represent upper and lower extremes, the box bounds represent upper and lower quartiles, respectively, and the central line represents the group median.Full size imageWeight changes in mice following challenge were similar among vaccinated and unvaccinated control groups following challenge until days 2-5, when weight loss in IM-IN-vaccinated mice halted and their weight began to increase after day 4, unlike other groups (Fig. 5b). This elevated weight in IM-IN mice on day 5 was statistically higher than IM-IM-vaccinated mice (IM-IN > IM-IM P = 0.0066).Viral loads in lungs (measured by M gene copy number/μg lung RNA) were all lower in vaccinated groups, however, only mice vaccinated IM-IN had statistically significant lower viral load compared with unvaccinated, challenged control mice (P = 0.0011, IM-IN vs. unvaccinated control); IM-IN-vaccinated mice had the lowest detectable viral loads among all vaccinated regimen mouse groups (Fig. 5c).Humoral antibody and cellular immune responses systemically and in the respiratory tract were assessed on day 5 of the challenge. IgG and IgA antibodies against H1N1-NP were detected above the control baseline in all regimens in serum 5 days post-challenge (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 6c). Within the airways of IM-IN- and IN-IN-vaccinated mice, higher IgG and IgA titres were detected compared with IM-IM vaccinated mice post-challenge (Supplementary Table 3c).Within BAL and Lungs, IM-IN-vaccinated, challenged mice had more CD8+ TRM cells (defined identically to that of H3N2 challenge), and the total number were statistically higher than measured in IM-IM-vaccinated mice (P = 0.0379 and P = 0.0267 for BAL and lung cells, respectively) (Fig. 5e). All regimens induced measurable numbers of TEM cells compared with unvaccinated, challenged control mice. IM-IN vaccination, however, induced the greatest numbers of TEM cells compared with other regimens.IM-IN immunised mice demonstrated greater protection compared with other regimens, though not sterilising; increased weight after day 4 of infection and lower viral loads were paired with distinctively higher levels of CD8+ TRM and TEM locally in BAL and lungs.DiscussionRSV and influenza A alongside SARS-CoV-2, have driven the “tridemic”; the cocirculation of all three respiratory viruses has resulted in a massive global disease burden. RSV and influenza A in particular, disproportionately impact children and the elderly. Recently, RSV vaccine candidates and a long-lasting antibody therapeutic (Nirsevimab) have been licensed, and vaccines against influenza are used in annual vaccination regimens23. Licensed RSV and influenza vaccines are mostly administered intramuscularly; a safe route associated with systemic immunity, and effective at eliminating severe disease. However, the IM route of vaccination has limited capacity to induce respiratory mucosal immunity, which has been associated with the control of respiratory infection35,36. A respiratory mucosal route of vaccination capable of inducing durable RSVF-specific memory B cells and neutralising antibodies at the site of viral entry will provide protection and reduce levels of infection2,37. Additionally, TRM induced upon mucosal vaccination resting within the lung parenchyma and airway mucosa, capable of rapid activation upon influenza A infection, are expected to largely enhance the control of virus infection38,39,40.As SARS-CoV-2, RSV and influenza persist globally, cost-effective, two-in-one bivalent vaccines, capable of inducing simultaneous respiratory and systemic immunity against RSV and influenza present an attractive strategy. In this study, a bivalent vaccine ChAdOx1-NP + M1-RSVF was designed and tested in mice. Whilst other animal models such as ferret for influenza virus and cotton rat for RSV may recapitulate aspects of the human immune response, the mouse model is well established for these types of immunogenicity and challenge study41,42; it can be used to discern and predict which regimens/vaccines may be more immunogenic and protective over others. It also has considerable overlaps with human infection, especially severe disease following infection41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49. Assessment of the immunogenicity and protection conferred after vaccination with ChAdOx1-NP + M1-RSVF supports further clinical development. Our work demonstrated that the route of vaccination and regimen have a strong influence on the nature of immune response and the extent of protection provided by ChAdOx1-NP + M1-RSVF. IM-IN-vaccinated mice generally demonstrated higher magnitudes of cellular and humoral responses, and a favourable Th1-skewed IgG subclass response was observed. The IM-IN regimen also demonstrated greater overall protection against infection over other homologous route regimens; the extent to which IM-IN vaccination offered greater protection, however, varied depending on the virus used in the challenge. Furthermore, the protection provided by IM-IN vaccination was likely via different mechanisms depending on whether RSV or influenza virus.Greater numbers of CD8+ TRM were noted in the lungs and BAL of IM-IN-vaccinated mice challenged with H3N2 and H1N1 influenza A strains, compared with those challenged with RSV. Preclinical studies have used conserved NP and M1 antigens as targets in their influenza vaccines for the generation of cross-protective T cells27,50,51,52. Some of these studies used NP and M1 antigens encoded in ChAdOx-based vectors and detected distinct differences in responses depending on the route of vaccination; aerosol vaccination of pre-exposed pigs with ChAdOx2-NP + M1-NA boosted mucosal immunity, and IM vaccination solely peripheral blood immunity51. A human trial using a MVA vectored, NP + M1-encoding vaccine concluded no advantageous protection over the control group when administered IM in individuals vaccinated 28 days prior with standard quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV)53. Here, it was suggested that alternative routes of vaccination such as aerosol or IN be considered for enhanced efficacy of vaccine53. It is likely that lung-resident cross-reactive TRM cells are important for greater control over influenza infection than what is provided through systemic vaccination38,39,40.In addition to TRM cells, ChAdOx1-NP + M1-RSVF elicited antibody responses against internal influenza A proteins NP and M1. Unlike NP- and M1-reactive CD8+ T cells, it is unclear what role anti-NP and M1 antibodies may contribute, if any, to protection against influenza infection and disease in humans. It has been suggested that anti-NP IgG antibodies that are capable of engaging effector cells via Fc-receptor-Fc binding may contribute to protection; such antibodies have been shown to be common in healthy and influenza-infected adults54. However, various small animal model studies have presented conflicting data in support of and against a protective role of anti-NP and M1 influenza protein antibodies55,56,57,58.IM-IN-vaccinated mice were less protected against H1N1 (A/California/7/2009) infection and disease, compared with when they were challenged with H3N2 (X31), despite both strains’ NP and M1 sequences being conserved to a similarly high degree to that encoded in the vaccine. Here, T cell immunity and potentially anti-NP and M1 antibodies were likely not adequate for sterilising protection against A/California/7/2009, which has shown to be more virulent in mouse infection models, compared with X3159.All ChAdOx1-NP + M1-RSVF vaccine regimens protected mice against RSV challenge, however, IM-IN- and IN-IN-vaccinated mice had the lowest viral loads upon challenge. The IM-IN regimen, specifically, was more Th1-leaning according to systemic immunogenicity data; IM-IN-vaccinated mice possessed the greatest relative IgG2a levels compared with other subclasses, and the smallest relative IgG1 levels. B cell class-switching to IgG2a is promoted by Th1-associated IFNγ release in the cellular milieu, whereas promotion of class-switching to IgG1 is mediated by Th2-associated cytokine IL-460. In alignment with this, the systemic (spleen) cytokine staining responses observed were generally TNF and IFNγ biased, and IM-IN vaccination was shown to induce high levels of IFNγ as measured via ELISpot assay. Th1 responses have been linked to lessened disease during RSV infection, whereas Th2-type responses have been associated with enhanced disease42,61,62.NAbs targeting the F protein likely contributed a considerable degree to the protection observed against RSV disease63,64,65. Earlier serum and antibody passive transfer studies and more recent correlate of protection studies have supported the role of humoral immunity in protection from RSV infection and disease63,64,65. A large number of RSV candidates, as well as licensed RSV vaccines Abrysvo and Arexvy, utilise stabilised F protein antigens, which have been widely tested and proven to generate protective neutralising antibodies14,19,66,67,68. The lower measured viral load in IM-IN- and IN-IN-vaccinated mouse lungs may have been as a result of enhanced mucosal antibody responses, or may reflect a more multifactorial mechanism of RSV protection. CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, and specifically TRM, have also been described as important for protection against RSV, and in other studies, control over RSV infection has been demonstrated by T cells in the absence of RSV-specific antibodies69,70,71,72.Limited work has explored the employment of RSV and influenza vaccines via a heterologous systemic prime, mucosal boost regimen. However, a range of studies involving RSV and influenza vaccines have tested mucosal vaccinations6,14,15,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81. In such examples, mucosal vaccination (via IN, intrapulmonary and/or aerosol) priming generally generated higher respiratory mucosal responses than parenteral/systemic routes (IM and intraperitoneal). Nevertheless, within our study we found that responses of the greatest magnitude and protection against disease and infection were established when systemic priming preceded a mucosal boost; such responses were generally higher in IM-IN-vaccinated mice than IN-prime or IN-IN-vaccinated mice, highlighting the benefit of hybrid, inter-compartmental vaccination. With such a combination, the benefits of systemic and respiratory mucosal immunity are both harnessed. IM-priming “secured” an IgG2a > IgG1 response that was maintained following IN boost.Alternative systemic-prime, mucosal-boost vaccination regimens have been described in other studies involving SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. One such study used a ChAd-based platform, and showed that a combination IM-IN regimen was able to induce potent responses superior to homologous route regimens, with antibody responses of the highest magnitude and Th1-skewing, consistent with our results82,83,84,85. The “prime-pull” regimen strategy has been used for other mucosal vaccines against non-respiratory pathogens, such as chlamydia; and proven to induce strong immunity within minipigs86.Further investigation of the suitability of the ChAdOx1-NP + M1-RSVF and the IM-IN vaccination strategy for use in infants and the elderly will be important, as infant and older adults cohorts are particularly burdened by RSV and influenza virus23,87. Consideration of current clinical practice regarding vaccination against RSV and influenza and how this vaccine could be used as an auxiliary product will be considered through future clinical development and assessment.This study supports further exploration of the systemic prime, mucosal boost route regimen combination for vaccines against respiratory viruses. It specifically demonstrates ChAdOx1-NP + M1-RSVF as a bivalent RSV and influenza vaccine candidate suitable for further clinical testing.MethodsVaccine constructionThe nucleoprotein (NP) gene and Matrix protein 1 (M1) gene from influenza virus A/Panama/2007/99 (H3N2) were linked through a glycine linker and codon optimised for expression in human cells. The genes were synthesised by GeneArt Gene Synthesis (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The genes were inserted into the Gateway® attL1/2 recombination cassette of a shuttle plasmid containing a human cytomegalovirus major immediate early promoter (IE CMV), including two tetracycline operator 2 sites, and the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal. The separate pre-fusion-stabilised RSV-F (DS2) gene sequence was codon-optimized for expression in human cell lines and synthesised by GeneArt Gene Synthesis (Thermo Fisher Scientific). This gene was inserted into the Gateway® attL3/4 recombination cassette of a shuttle plasmid containing a human cytomegalovirus major immediate early promoter (IE CMV), also including two tetracycline operator 2 sites, and the SV40 polyadenylation signal. Bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) containing ChAdOx1 NP + M1-RSVF were prepared by Gateway® recombination between the ChAdOx1 destination DNA BAC vector (described in Dicks, M. D. J. et al.88) and the shuttle plasmids containing the influenza virus NP + M1 gene expression cassette and RSVF gene expression cassette using standard protocols resulting in the insertion of the influenza virus gene expression cassette at the E1 locus and RSV gene expression cassette at the E4 locus (downstream of the E4 genes and upstream of the right inverted terminal repeat). The ChAdOx1 NP + M1-RSVF adenovirus genome was excised from the BAC using unique PmeI sites flanking the adenovirus genome sequence. ChAdOx1 NP + M1-RSVF viral vectors were rescued in T-RExTM cells (Invitrogen, Cat. R71007), a derivative of HEK293 cells which constitutively express the Tet repressor protein and prevent antigen expression during virus production. The resultant virus, ChAdOx1 NP + M1-RSVF, was purified by CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation as described previously89. The titres were determined on T-RExTM cells using antihexon immunostaining assay based on the QuickTiter™ Adenovirus Titer Immunoassay kit (Cell Biolabs Inc).Mouse immunisations and infection studiesMice for immunogenicity studies were used in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act under project license number 30/2889 or P9804B4F1 granted by the UK Home Office following an ethical review by the University of Oxford Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Board (AWERB). Mice for infection studies were used under license PP5168779, with all work approved by the Animal Welfare and Ethical Review board at Imperial College London; studies were in accordance with the Animal Research: Reporting of in vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines. Animals were group housed in IVCs under SPF conditions, with constant temperature and humidity with lighting on a 12:12 (8am to 8 pm) or 13:11 (7am to 8 pm) light-dark cycle. For induction of short-term anaesthesia, animals were anaesthetised using vaporised IsoFlo®. All animals were humanely sacrificed at the end of each experiment by cervical dislocation for immunogenicity studies, or via administration of 100 μL of intraperitoneal pentobarbitone (20 mg dose, Pentoject, Animalcare Ltd., UK) for infection studies. For assessment of vaccine immunogenicity, 5-week-old outbred CD-1 (Envigo) (n = 6) mice were vaccinated in regimens containing intramuscular injection and/or intranasal administration with 108 infection units (IU) of vector vaccine diluted in PBS under isofluorane-induced anaesthesia. Intranasal vaccination involved suspending a total volume of 25 μL of vaccine drop-by-drop over the mouse nostrils with a pipette, ensuring active inhalation of the vaccine. Intramuscular vaccinations involved injection of 50 μL of vaccine into the muscle of the left inner thigh. For infection challenge experiments, female BALB/c mice (Charles River, Polcreek) (n = 5) were anaesthetised using vaporised IsoFlo® and intranasally infected with 100 µl volume containing virus: RSV - 7.7×105 PFU RSV A2; H1N1 - 2.1×105 PFU A/California/7/2009; H3N2 2×105 X31. Viruses were propagated in cells (RSV:HEp2; Influenza:MDCK); RSV A2 was 3rd passage from a plaque-purified virus isolated by Dr Hongwei Wang (Imperial)90; Influenza viruses were a gift from Wendy Barclay (Imperial); they were also low passage. Mice were weighed daily following infection.Blood, lung and spleen processingBlood was collected either by terminal cardiac puncture (immunogenicity studies) or femoral vein (infection studies) and processed via centrifugation to collect serum fraction. Lungs were removed after dissection with the right lobe processed for flow cytometry and the left lobe frozen for future RNA extraction (for infection studies) or both lobes immediately processed for flow cytometry (for immunogenicity studies). For flow cytometry and ELISpots, spleens and lung were processed to a single cell suspension, and reconstituted in complete Minimum Essential Medium, α modification (α-MEM) (for immunogenicity studies), or complete RPMI (for infection studies), containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 1% L-glutamine. Lung tissue was treated with a digestion mixture of collagenase type XI and DNAse type I in α-MEM solely containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 1% L-glutamine, prior to processing in immunogenicity studies only. Processing of spleens and lungs was completed mechanically by pressing the tissue through 70-100 μM cell strainers, and the use of ammonium chloride potassium (ACK) lysis buffer for erythrocyte lysis. In immunogenicity studies, lung homogenate supernatant (LHS) was collected following the straining and centrifugation of lung cells (prior to their lysis), and was kept frozen until analysis via ELISA. Processed cells were then either manually counted via trypan blue (for infection studies), or via CASY cell counter (for immunogenicity studies).Naso-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) removal and processingTo acquire NALT fluid, the upper hard palate of mice was excised with a scalpel and cleaned of blood and debris. It was then added to 250 μL complete RPMI in wells of a 48 well plate. It was incubated for 3 days at 37 °C in a cell culture incubator. After incubation, supernatant was removed and spun down to pellet cellular debris. Supernatant was then frozen until use in assays. A more detailed protocol is described by Cisney et al.91.Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) collection and nasal washes (NWs)For BALF collection, a catheter was inserted into the trachea and mouse lungs were then lavaged with a syringe to inflate the lung three times with 1 ml of PBS (for infection studies) or lavaged solely once with 300 µL (for immunogenicity studies). BAL fluid was then transferred to a 1.5 mL collection tube and centrifuged at 460 g for 5 minutes and supernatants collected and frozen at −80 °C (for both infection and immunogenicity studies). Supernatants were additionally treated with protease inhibitor at 1:100 dilution prior to freezing for immunogenicity studies. The cell pellet was then resuspended with 500 µL of ACK for 2 minutes, then quenched with PBS, before centrifugation at 460 g for 5 minutes. The pellet was then resuspended in RPMI for flow cytometry in infection studies. Nasal fluid for NWs were collected by flushing the nasal cavity with 1 mL of PBS.Lung cell and splenocyte stimulation, staining and flow cytometry following immunogenicity studiesEach lung and splenocyte sample were stimulated separately with a pool of peptides spanning H3N2 A/Panama/2007/1999 NP + M1 or mRSV(F)-DS2, or were left unstimulated, for 6 hours at 37 °C (Supplementary Table 4a). 2 hours into the incubation, BD GolgiplugTM was added to all cells. After stimulation, cells were stained with surface markers, fixed with 10% neutral-buffered formalin (containing 4% paraformaldehyde), and then permeabilised with BD PERM/WashTM buffer to allow intracellular antibody staining. Cells were stained with BV711™ anti-mouse CD69 Antibody (Clone: H1.2F3, Cat: 104537 (Biolegend), diluted 1:100), Alexa Fluor® 488 anti-mouse TNF-α Antibody (Clone: MP6-XT22, Cat: 506313 (Biolegend), diluted 1:100), PE anti-mouse IL-4 Antibody (Clone: 11B11, Cat: 504104 (Biolegend), dilution 1:50), PE/Dazzle™ 594 anti-mouse CD103 Recombinant Antibody (Clone: QA17A24, Cat: 156910 (Biolegend), diluted 1:50), PE/Cyanine7 anti-mouse CD62L Antibody (Clone: MEL-14, Cat: 104418 (Biolegend), diluted 1:50), Alexa Fluor® 700 anti-mouse/human CD44 Antibody (Clone: IM7, Cat: 103026 (eBioscience), diluted 1:100), BV650™ anti-mouse/human CD45R/B220 Antibody (Clone: RA3-62B, Cat: 103241 (Biolegend), diluted 1:100), IFN gamma Monoclonal Antibody eFluor 450 (Clone: XMG1.2, Cat: 48-7311-82 (eBioscience), diluted 1:50), BUV496 Rat Anti-Mouse CD4 (Clone: GK1.5, Cat: 612952 (BD Biosciences), diluted 1:100), BUV395 Rat Anti-Mouse CD8a (Clone: 53-6.7, Cat: 563786 (BD Biosciences), diluted 1:100), PerCP/Cyanine5.5 anti-mouse IL-2 Antibody (Clone: JES6-5H4, Cat: 503822 (Biolegend), diluted 1:50), PE/Cyanine5 anti-mouse CD127 (IL-7Rα) Antibody (Clone: A7R34, Cat: 135016 (Biolegend), diluted 1:100) and BV605™ anti-mouse CD183 (CXCR3) Antibody (Clone: CXCR3-173, Cat: 126523 (Biolegend), diluted 1:100). Excess antibodies were washed off with 1% BSA in PBS three times then acquired on a BD LSRFortessa™ Cell Analyzer. To stain for TRM cells, the panel above was modified to include Brilliant Violet 650TM anti-mouse CD3 (Clone: 172 A, Cat: 100229 (Biolegend)) that was intravenously injected into the peripheral tail vein of mice before culling (2.5 μg per mouse in 100 μL total injection volume). BV650™ anti-mouse/human CD45R/B220 antibody was not included in this alternative panel.Cell staining and flow cytometry following infection studiesLung cells and cells from BALF were first stained with 100 µl of Live/Dead violet dye (ArCTM, Cat: A10346) for 20 minutes at 4 °C in the dark. After washing, cells were then resuspended in Fc block (Clone: 2.4G2) in PBS-1% BSA, then washed and stained with the following surface antibodies: FITC anti-mouse CD3 (Clone: 12A2, Cat: 100204 (Biolegend), diluted 1:400), APC-H7 anti-CD8 (Clone: 53-6.7, Cat: 560247 (BD Biosciences), diluted 1:100), BV605 anti-CD103 (Clone: 2E7, Cat: 121433 (Biolegend), diluted 1:70), APC anti-mouse CD69 (Clone: H1.2F3, Cat: 104513 (Biolegend), diluted 1:70), PerCP-Cy5.5 anti-mouse CD4 (Clone: RM4-5, Cat: 100540 (Biolegend), diluted 1:200), BV711 anti-mouse CD44 (Clone: IM7, Cat: 103001 (Biolegend), diluted 1:200), PE-Cy7 anti-mouse CD62L (Clone: MEL-14, Cat: 104418 (Biolegend), diluted 1:200) for one hour in the dark.

For RSV infection experiment, pentamer H-2Kd KYKNVTEL (RSV A F protein 85-93: ProImmune, diluted 1:100) was additionally added to the surface antibody stain; pentamers were PE conjugated. Excess antibodies were washed off with 1% BSA in PBS three times then acquired on a BD LSRFortessa™ Cell Analyzer.Spleen IFNγ ELISpotsPVDF-membrane ELISpot plates (Millipore) were coated with 5μg/mL anti-mouse IFNy (Cat: 3321-2 A, AN18 (Mabtech)), 50 μL per well. Splenocytes in complete α-MEM, at a density of 107 cells/mL, were plated on pre-blocked plates. Then, peptide pools either spanning NP + M1 or RSVF-DS2 (4 total pools per antigen) were added for stimulation of the cells over 18 hours at 37 oC (Supplementary Table 4a). IFNy spots were detected through the use of anti-mouse IFNγ antibody, biotinylated (Cat: 3321-2 A, mAb R4-6A2, biotin (Mabtech), diluted 1 mg/mL), followed by streptavidin-ALP (Cat: 3321-2 A (Mabtech), diluted 1 mg/mL). Development involved adding AP conjugate substrate (Cat: 1706432 (Biorad)). Spots were counted on an AID ELISpot reader, and data represented as spot-forming units (SFUs) per million splenocytes. The sum of responses from one sample across the 4 antigen peptide pools was used for figures.Lung viral load measurementViral load was assessed by Trizol extraction of RNA from frozen lung tissue disrupted in a TissueLyzer (Qiagen, Manchester, UK). RNA was converted into cDNA, and quantitative RT-PCR was carried out on a Stratagene Mx3005p (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). For influenza M gene 0.1 μM forward primer (5′AAGACAAGACCAATYCTGTCACCTCT-3′), 0.1 μM reverse primer (5′-TCTACGYTGCAGTCCYCGCT-3′) and 0.2 μM probe (5′-FAM-TYACGCTCACCGTGCCCAGTG-TAMRA-3′). M-specific RNA copy number was determined using an influenza M gene standard plasmid. For RSV L gene, 0.1 µM primers 5′-GAACTCAGTGTAGGTAGAATGTTTGCA-3′ and 5′-TTCAGCTATCATTTTCTCTGCCAA-3′ and probe 5′-6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-TTTGAACCTGTCTGAACAT-6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA)-3′. RNA copy number per mg of lung RNA was determined using an RSV L gene standard.Standardised indirect antigen-specific isotype ELISAs96 well NuncTMMaxiSorpTM plates were separately coated with 50μL/well of 2μg/mL (for tIgG and IgG subclass detection) or 5μg/mL (for IgA and IgM detection) recombinant Influenza A H1N1 (A/Puerto Rico/8/34/Mount Sinai) Nucleoprotein/NP I116M (ECD, His Tag), Influenza A H1N1 (A/Puerto Rico/8/34/Mount Sinai) Matrix protein 1 / M1 Protein (His Tag), Influenza A H3N2 (A/Hong Kong/2671/2019) Nucleoprotein / NP Protein (His Tag) Influenza A H3N2 (A/Aichi/2/1968) Matrix protein 1 / M1 Protein (His Tag) or Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (A2) Fusion glycoprotein/RSV-F protein (ECD, His Tag) (all SinoBiological), overnight at 4 °C. Plates were then washed with PBS/Tween (0.05% v/v), and then blocked for 1 hour at RT with Blocker Casein in PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Blocker was then tapped off, and standard positive “high-responding” serum or mucosal tissue fluid was added, along with samples at individual dilutions in casein, and other appropriate controls, all in duplicate; sample incubation was 2 hours at RT for all assays. Plates were washed after incubation, and casein-diluted secondary antibody added to plates for incubation 1 hour RT shaking; antibodies used were alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Cat:A3562 (Sigma Aldrich), diluted 1:5000), Goat Anti-Mouse IgA-AP (Cat: 1040-04 (SouthernBiotech), diluted 1:1500), Goat Anti-Mouse IgM-AP (Cat: 1021-04 (SouthernBiotech), diluted 1:1500), Goat Anti-Mouse IgG1, Human/Bovine/Horse SP ads-AP (Cat: 1071-04 (SouthernBiotech), diluted 1:4000), Goat Anti-Mouse IgG2a, Human/Bovine/Horse SP ads-AP (Cat: 1081-04 (SouthernBiotech), diluted 1:4000), Goat Anti-Mouse IgG2b, Human/Bovine/Horse SP ads-AP (Cat: 1091-04 (SouthernBiotech), diluted 1:4000), Goat Anti-Mouse IgG2c, Human/Bovine/Horse SP ads-AP (Cat: 1078-04 (SouthernBiotech), diluted 1:4000), Goat Anti-Mouse IgG3 heavy chain (Alkaline Phosphatase) preadsorbed (Cat: ab98705 (Abcam), diluted 1:1000). Unbound detection antibody was washed prior to addition of p-Nitrophenyl Phosphate, Disodium Salt substrate (Sigma-Aldrich). For IgG, IgA and IgM sample, OD405nm values were interpolated off a standard curve made of positive reference sera, which was assigned arbitrary ELISA units and fitted to a 4-parameter logistic curve. For IgG subclasses, sera samples were normalised based on tIgG values prior to plating, and plates read when the first sample in any group reached 1.00 OD405nm for each subclass.Data and statistical analysesAll statistical analyses were performed on GraphPad Prism 9.0 and 10.0. Medians were used as representative values for each mouse group. Solely nonparametric statistical tests were completed on data. For paired data (such as vaccination timepoint antibody data), Friedman tests were used to determine statistically significant differences. For differences between comparable groups, such as different vaccination regimens, Kruskal Wallis tests were completed. For assessment of statistically significant differences in experiments involving two groups, Mann-Whitney U-Tests were performed. P values were symbolised as *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. Where data was represented in log10 form, data was converted to log10 prior to statistical analysis. Flow data was analysed on FlowJo software (10.9.0) using the gating strategies described in Supplementary Fig. 7a and b. For cytokine expression and ELISpot values displayed on graphs, the values from the samples when they were in an unstimulated state were subtracted from the stimulated values.

Overview CDC estimates the total number of flu illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths prevented by vaccination using a model that incorporates season-specific data on burden of disease, vaccine coverage and vaccine effectiveness (VE) for five age groups. More detailed description of the method can be found in an article by Tokars, et al1. CDC uses the annual estimates of influenza (flu) vaccination coverage by month during each season, and the final end-of-season vaccine effectiveness measurements to estimate how many people did not get a flu vaccine and were not protected by vaccine from an influenza virus infection (or were “unprotected” from flu) during the season. The rate of each outcome (illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, or deaths) among unprotected people is calculated and then used to estimate the number of flu-related outcomes that would have been expected in the population if no one had been protected by flu vaccination. Finally, the outcomes prevented by flu vaccination are calculated as the difference between outcomes in the hypothetical unvaccinated population and the observed vaccinated population. Estimates of flu vaccination coverage by month were based on self-report or parental report of vaccination status using data from the National Immunization Survey for children aged 6 months-17 years and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey data for adults 18 years and older.2 Vaccine effectiveness estimates for each season are derived from existing CDC flu vaccine effectiveness networks.3 These networks estimate the effectiveness of vaccination for preventing flu diagnosed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-positive testing among persons with acute respiratory illness of ≤7 days duration seen in hospitals, emergency departments, or outpatient clinics in the United States. Calculations were stratified by month of the year to account for annual variations in the timing of disease and vaccination and then summed across the whole season. How flu burden is estimated Rates of laboratory-confirmed flu-related hospitalization by age group were obtained from FluSurv-NET, a collaboration between CDC, the Emerging Infections Program Network, and selected state and local health departments in 14 geographically distributed areas in the United States that conduct population-based flu surveillance. Reported hospitalization rates were adjusted using a multiplier to correct for underreporting, which is calculated from the percent of people hospitalized with respiratory illness who were tested for flu and the average sensitivity of flu tests used in the surveillance hospitals. The percentage of people hospitalized and tested for flu was measured from data collected each season since the 2010-2011 flu season. When adjusting the hospitalization rates, testing data from prior seasons is used until testing data from that specific season is available usually 2 years after the season ends. Adjusted rates were applied to the U.S. population by age group to calculate the numbers of flu-related hospitalizations. The numbers of flu illnesses were then estimated from hospitalizations based on previously measured ratios that reflect the estimated number of ill persons per hospitalization in each age group.4 The number of people seeking medical care for flu were then calculated using age group-specific data on the percentages of people with a respiratory illness who sought medical care, which was estimated from results of the 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey.5 All estimates were rounded to two significant digits.

COVID is sometimes worse than the flu, as it spreads more easily and has caused higher rates of hospitalizations and deaths. It's not uncommon for one or more symptoms to signal many different conditions or illnesses. It may be hard to figure out what illness, disorder, syndrome, or infection you're experiencing when this happens. Read on to learn the difference between the flu and COVID. What Is a 'Tripledemic'? Experts Warn COVID, Flu, and RSV May Converge This Winter Similarities COVID and the flu share many overlapping characteristics. They're both primarily respiratory illnesses, meaning they infect a person's respiratory tract. The two viruses also spread in similar ways and share some common symptoms. How the Viruses Spread Both COVID and the flu spread mainly from person to person by infected respiratory particles. Transmission happens most commonly with close contact with infected people. A sick person coughs or sneezes out infected droplets that another nearby person can then inhale. Both viruses can spread by touching another person or object that has the virus on it. Symptoms Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID) are respiratory illnesses that can result in similar symptoms. Research has shown that the most common symptoms seen in both illnesses are fever and cough. A person can show a range of symptoms, from no symptoms at all to several severe symptoms. The following may appear if you have the flu or COVID: Change in or loss of taste and smell (more common with COVID) Cough Fatigue Fever and chills Headache Muscle pain or body aches Runny or stuffy nose Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Sore throat Vomiting and diarrhea (more common in children with the flu or COVID) Keep in mind that flu symptoms might appear within one to four days after you've been infected. It can take up to 14 days for symptoms to appear if you have COVID. COVID can also last longer than the flu, depending on the severity. Some people can have COVID symptoms for several weeks or months if they have severe illness. Differences Different viruses cause COVID and the flu, although they share many similarities. People with COVID also have a higher risk of more complications that affect several organs than those with the flu. Causes Both viruses primarily cause respiratory illnesses, but they are not the same. The flu is caused by influenza viruses, of which there are two main types: influenza A and influenza B viruses. Influenza A viruses are further categorized into subtypes called hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N), of which there are numerous combinations). Influenza B viruses are broken down into lineages (B/Yamagata and B/Victoria). COVID, on the other hand, is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This virus is technically called a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that typically cause mild to moderate respiratory tract illnesses, like the common cold. COVID is one of three coronaviruses that has caused severe illness on a global or very large scale. The other coronaviruses are severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory system (MERS). Complications COVID and the flu can cause many of the same symptoms. Both can lead to cases of: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) Pneumonia Respiratory failure Secondary bacterial infections, like sinus and ear infections, can occur in people with COVID and the flu. It's more common to develop a bacterial infection from the flu. COVID can affect the body's other organ systems more than the flu. Blood clots in the veins or arteries in the lungs, heart, legs, or brain are more common in COVID than in flu cases. The illness can also lead to multi-system inflammatory syndrome in which various body parts become inflamed (e.g., the heart, lungs, kidneys, or brain). Long COVID—sometimes known as long-haul syndrome or post-COVID—is also a complication of COVID not seen in flu cases. This syndrome can last weeks or months after being infected with the virus, even if you just had mild symptoms. Long COVID includes a range of symptoms, including: Brain fog Fatigue Headache Heart palpitations Muscle aches Infections and Deaths There have been several hundred million confirmed cases and millions of deaths due to COVID globally. COVID has caused over 97 million confirmed illnesses and more than one million deaths in the United States. These are only confirmed cases. The actual number of COVID cases may be much higher since some people may not have seen a healthcare provider for symptoms. There are an estimated one billion cases of the flu each year and up to 650,000 influenza-related deaths each year. The estimated annual burden of the flu in the United States is between nine million and 41 million illnesses and 12,000 to 52,000 deaths each year. Treatments The flu can be treated with prescription medications known as antiviral drugs like: Rapivab (peramivir)Relenza (zanamivir)Tamiflu (oseltamivir) These medications work best when they're started soon after flu symptoms begin, within approximately two days of symptom onset. Not everyone needs antiviral drugs for the flu. Most people who are healthy and not at risk for complications can likely treat the flu with sleep, fluids, and fever reducers. Those who have severe illness but don't need hospitalization, or people with mild illness who are at high risk for complications, may benefit from antivirals. You can also get plenty of rest, stay hydrated, and use fever reducers to help COVID go away. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved several drugs to treat COVID, such as Paxlovid (nirmatrelviritonavir). Paxlovid is available by prescription. Veklury (remdesivir) is recommended for children and adults who have mild-to-moderate COVID with a high risk of severe illness. Olumiant (baricitinib) and Actemra (tocilizumab) are recommended for use in those who are hospitalized and need supplemental oxygen. How To Prevent COVID-19 and the Flu Both COVID and the flu have vaccines that prevent severe illness. No vaccine prevents illness 100%, but they can greatly reduce hospitalization and death. People aged six months and older are eligible to be vaccinated against both illnesses. The flu has multiple FDA-approved vaccines produced annually based on the four flu viruses experts believe will circulate. This is why flu vaccines are called quadrivalent influenza vaccines. FDA-approved vaccines that can protect against COVID include Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. These vaccines use mRNA, which is genetic material. mRNA helps your cells make proteins that trigger an immune response to fight COVID. You can also help stave off both illnesses with proper prevention techniques. You may wear masks, wash your hands frequently, and physically distance yourself from large groups of people. Getting COVID and Flu Shots Together May Slightly Increase Risk of Stroke in Older Adults A Quick Review There are countless similarities and differences between COVID and the flu. Both are viral infections that spread from person to person and cause symptoms like cough, fever, and sore throat. COVID can be worse than the flu since it spreads easier and can affect more organs if it causes severe illness. If you have any questions or concerns about either illness, including symptoms or treatments, you should talk to a healthcare provider. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Tell us why!

"We have been actively engaged in conducting studies using continuous flow pasteurization equipment, reflective of those in commercial use, to help confirm pasteurization parameters that are effective at inactivating H5N1 HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] virus during milk processing," it said.Human serology study launches in MichiganIn other developments, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) yesterday posted its research agenda, and Demetre Daskalakis, MD, who directs the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said the CDC is providing technical assistance to Michigan health officials, who have launched a seroprevalence study in people who work with infected cows. He said a key goal is to see if asymptomatic infections are occurring in the risk group.The CDC spelled out three main research objectives, including preventing illness in people exposed to H5N1, with assessing antiviral effectiveness as one of the focus areas. Other objectives include understanding infection in people, including estimating the incubation period, and preparing for and mitigating the possibility of an H5N1 pandemic.So far, more than 690 people exposed to sick cattle have been monitored, and at least 51 with flulike symptoms have been tested, Daskalakis said. The number of human infections related to H5N1 outbreaks in dairy cows remains at three.USDA enrolls more farms in health and compensation programsIn animal developments, Eric Deeble, DVM, Acting Senior Advisor for US Department of Agriculture (USDA) H5N1 response, told reported that the first herds in four states have enrolled in a voluntary H5N1 dairy herd status program, which was first announced at the end of May. The program is designed to give farmers more ways to monitor the health of their herds while streamlining the shipping of cows and providing ongoing information to the USDA.The herds are in Texas, New Mexico, Nebraska, and Kansas.Deeble said 20 herds are enrolled in USDA financial support programs, such as compensation for a loss of milk production, a number that he says is growing every day.The testing at the USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratory has confirmed 126 outbreaks from 12 states, with the most recent confirmations from Colorado and Iowa.

This study focuses on a patient infected with the H10N3 subtype of avian influenza virus, admitted to the Third People’s Hospital of Kunming City on March 6, 2024. Metagenomic RNA sequencing and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis were conducted on the patient’s sputum, confirming the H10N3 infection. The patient presented severe pneumonia symptoms such as fever, expectoration, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and cough. Phylogenetic analysis of the Haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of the virus showed that the virus was most closely related to a case of human infection with the H10N3 subtype of avian influenza virus found in Zhejiang Province, China. Analysis of amino acid mutation sites identified four mutations potentially hazardous to human health. Consequently, this underscores the importance of continuous and vigilant monitoring of the dynamics surrounding the H10N3 subtype of avian influenza virus, utilizing advanced genomic surveillance techniques.IntroductionWith the continuous advancement of urbanization and rural development, the frequency and scope of contact between humans and animals are constantly expanding (Schell et al., 2021). In cities, people have close contact with poultry and pets, while in rural areas, farmers and breeders deal directly with poultry and livestock. This kind of contact is not limited to daily life, but also includes activities such as poultry raising, breeding, slaughtering, and other activities, providing opportunities for the spread of pathogens (Tobin et al., 2015; Moyen et al., 2021). Moreover, increased global trade and travel have intensified the risk of cross-border disease transmission (Shah et al., 2019). The international trade of animals and their products facilitates the rapid spread of pathogens worldwide. Simultaneously, human transnational travel creates favorable conditions for pathogen dissemination. The occurrence of a single case can rapidly attract global attention and vigilance. In this era of interconnectedness and swift information dissemination, avian influenza, as a significant zoonotic viral infectious disease, has garnered considerable concern due to its potential transmission risks and hazards. Consequently, enhancing surveillance, prevention, and control measures for zoonotic diseases like avian influenza has emerged as a crucial global public health priority.Avian influenza virus is a type of RNA virus, classified under the genus Influenza A virus of the family Orthomyxoviridae, and is categorized into types A, B, C, and D (Hu et al., 2018). Among these, avian influenza A virus is particularly concerning for human health, as it can lead to severe illness and even fatalities. Avian influenza virus is polymorphic, with a spherical diameter ranging from 80 to 120 nm and possessing an envelope. Its genome consists of segmented single-stranded negative-sense RNA, making it highly variable (Spackman, 2008). Based on the antigenicity of its hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins on the outer membrane, it is currently classified into 18 H subtypes (H1-H18) and 11 N subtypes (N1-N11) (Li et al., 2021). Human transmission of avian influenza viruses usually occurs through contact with infected poultry or their excreta, secretions, etc., particularly in settings such as poultry farming, slaughtering, and handling, where the risks are heightened (Wong and Yuen, 2006). Individuals infected with avian influenza virus may display a range of symptoms, with severity varying among cases (Horman et al., 2018). Common symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, headache, muscle and joint pain, fatigue, breathing difficulties, chest tightness, respiratory failure, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, etc. Infection with this virus can lead to severe complications like pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), especially in individuals with underlying health conditions or weakened immune systems. Therefore, prompt medical attention is essential when experiencing such symptoms, especially if severe manifestations like breathing difficulties arise. To date, confirmed subtypes of avian influenza A viruses that have infected humans include H6N1, H9N2, H10N8, H5N6, H7N4, H10N3, and H5N8, etc (Yang et al., 2022). Patients infected with H5N1, in particular, often experience severe illness with a high mortality rate.Currently, avian influenza virus infection cannot be diagnosed based on clinical manifestations alone; instead, laboratory testing is required (Geyer et al., 2022). Commonly used laboratory testing methods include serological diagnostic methods such as hemagglutination and hemagglutination inhibition tests, neuraminidase inhibition test, agarose diffusion test, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Additionally, molecular biology diagnostic technologies such as reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), fluorescent RT-PCR, and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) are employed. NGS technology, in particular, provides a powerful tool for the detection and research of avian influenza viruses (Soda et al., 2023). It allows high-throughput and deep sequencing of viral genomes, providing detailed genomic information, including the virus’s full genome sequence, mutations, recombination events and gene expression levels (Quer et al., 2022). This technology not only enables highly sensitive and specific detection, but also aids researchers in understanding virus evolution, transmission, and host interactions.In recent years, human infection with avian influenza virus has been frequently reported around the world, especially involving subtypes H5, H7, and other (Gao, 2018; Liang, 2023; Szablewski et al., 2023). Among these, human infections with H10 avian influenza A virus have been reported globally, including subtypes H10N7, H10N8, and H10N3 (Arzey et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2014). The H10N3 subtype of avian influenza A virus has been circulating among waterfowl and poultry in East and South Asia for decades, with rare instances of human infection (Wisedchanwet et al., 2011). The first recorded human cases of Avian-Origin Influenza A (H10N3) virus occurred in Jiangsu, China, in April 2021 (Qi et al., 2022), followed by a second case reported in Zhejiang in June 2022 (Zhang et al., 2023).In this study, we utilized metagenomic NGS (mNGS) and nanopore metagenomic sequencing to document the first recorded instance of human infection with avian influenza A virus H10N3 in Yunnan Province. This case marks the occurrence of H10N3 human infection in China. To elucidate the virus’s origin, we conducted a comprehensive epidemiological investigation, performed phylogenetic analysis, and aligned the virus’s entire genome sequence with homologous sequences. Additionally, to evaluate the virus’s adaptability and pathogenicity in human hosts, we analyzed the amino acid mutation sites of three H10N3 subtype AIV infections among humans.Materials and methodsData collectionOn March 6, 2024 the patient went to Kunming Third People’s Hospital for treatment due to persistent fever for many days. The diagnosis revealed severe pneumonia, type I respiratory failure, and infection with avian influenza A virus. After the diagnosis of avian influenza A virus infection, the patient underwent investigation through questionnaires, which included demographic information, poultry contact history, underlying health conditions, and other relevant data.Genomic analysis and genome assemblyMultiple amplification products were obtained using influenza A virus genotyping gene targeted amplification kit (BaiyiTech, Hangzhou). The amplified products were purified using ampure XP beads nucleic acid magnetic bead Purification Kit (Beckman, USA) and the library was constructed. The library was constructed by ligation method with the kit sqk-nbd114.24 (Nanopore, UK). After the library was constructed, it was added to the flo-min 114 sequencing chip (Nanopore, UK), and high-throughput sequencing was performed on the gridion X5 third-generation sequencer. All experimental procedures were meticulously performed in strict accordance with the instructions provided by the respective kits and the requirements for the nanopore third-generation high-throughput sequencing.Phylogenetic analysisThe nucleotide sequences obtained were analyzed in the Genbank and GISAID databases (www.gisaid.org) using Nucleotide Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) software of NCBI to initially determine the virus subtypes. Similar HA and NA nucleotide sequences were downloaded for phylogenetic analysis. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences were aligned using MAFFT (v7.310), and the phylogenetic trees was constructed based on the neighbor-joining method using MEGA-X.Ethics statementThe patient and his family members signed consent forms approving the investigation, sample collection and its publication. The procedures were in accordance with the Helsinki declaration of 1975, as revised in 1983. This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee at Kunming hird People’s Hospital (No. KSLL20230711009) and adhered to the guidelines established in the Declaration of Helsinki. To protect patients’ personal information, including names and ID numbers, it was encrypted before use.ResultsA previously healthy 51-year-old male experienced recurrent fever for a week, reaching a maximum temperature of 39°C, accompanied by symptoms of cough, expectoration, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Despite seeking medical attention at the local community health service center, his symptoms did not significantly improve. Consequently, he was transferred to the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine at the Third People’s Hospital of Kunming City in Yunnan Province, Southwest China, on March 6, 2024.Upon admission (7 days after the onset of illness), the patient presented with a temperature of 39℃, a pulse rate of 110 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 78%, and blood pressure measuring 105/70 mmHg (Table 1). Laboratory tests revealed a low white blood cell count, elevated neutrophil percentage, decreased platelet count, and elevated levels of infectious markers. Additionally, a throat swab specimen tested positive for influenza A virus nucleic acid by PCR (Table 2). Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple patchy and increased density shadows in both lungs, characterized by unclear boundaries and uneven density (Figure 1). The initial diagnosis upon admission included severe pneumonia, type I respiratory failure, and influenza attributed to influenza A virus.Table 1 Table 1 Patient’s characteristics and clinical symptoms.Table 2 Table 2 Laboratory Test Results.Figure 1 Figure 1 Computed tomography of lung. (A, B) Results on March 6, 2024 showed that multiple patchy and patchy increased density shadows were seen in both lungs, with unclear boundary and uneven density; (C, D) Results on March 23, 2024 showed a reduction in lesions compared to previous scans.The patient was administered oseltamivir (150mg, twice daily) and methylprednisolone (80mg, once daily) and corresponding antibiotics for treatment. Subsequent sputum culture results revealed infection with Candida albicans and Staphylococcus epidermidis and Acinetobacter joni and Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacter cloacae, prompting the administration of appropriate antibiotics (Table 1). The patient’s fever subsided on March 17th (18 days after illness onset), and on March 19th (20 days after illness onset), the nucleic acid test for influenza A virus returned negative results for the first time. Subsequent test results on March 21st (22 days after illness onset) indicated normalization of the patient’s white blood cell count, along with a decrease or return to normal levels of infection markers. However, the patient exhibited prolonged prothrombin time. Chest computed tomography scans showed a reduction in lesions compared to previous scans (Figure 1). The lung lesions were noticeably absorbed, and there was no chest tightness or dyspnea. The patient was discharged on April 17th, and home oxygen therapy was recommended.Although the nucleic acid detection of influenza A virus confirmed the patient’s infection with influenza A virus, it could not determine the specific subtype. A sputum sample collected from the patient on March 8 was confirmed as H10N3 subtype by mNGS and PCR in the Third People’s Hospital of Kunming City and the Kunming City Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, epidemiological investigations revealed that the patient had a history of raising various birds, including chickens, ducks, geese, pigeons, peacocks, and ostriches. Notably, more than 20 chickens and geese died in the week preceding the onset of his illness, and he had a history of slaughtering these birds. However, the virus has not been detected in the environment or in poultry carcasses. No avian influenza A virus infection was detected in his close contacts.To obtain the complete genome sequence of the virus and clarify its molecular characteristics, the Kunming City CDC conducted nanopore sequencing (Nanopore, GridION X5) on the samples, resulting in the acquisition of the whole genome information of the samples (GISAID#EPIISL19067870), named A/Yunnan/A/2024(H10N3). Online analysis using BLASTN software on the GISAID website revealed that all eight gene segments of the H10N3 virus strain in our case originated from Eurasian avian influenza viruses. Analysis of the evolutionary trees of the Haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes suggested that the patient’s strain is a cross-species infection of the H10N3 virus, which has been prevalent in poultry in China in recent years (Figure 2). Homologous comparison in GenBank with BLAST revealed a high similarity between Yunnan strain’s HA gene (98.64%) and NA gene (99.43%) with A/Zhejiang/1412/2022(H10N3) virus (Table 3). Further analysis of amino acid mutation sites revealed a mutation at the 226th amino acid residue in the receptor binding site of the HA protein, where the amino acid changed from Q to L. Additionally, key mutations were identified, including D701N of PB2 protein, S409N of PA protein, and S31N of M2 protein (Table 4).Figure 2 Figure 2 Phylogenetic trees of H10N3 strains based on nucleotide sequence.

However, due to the 8-segment nature of the viral genome and the RNA error replication mechanism, frequent recombination and mutation of the virus can occur, potentially enabling it to survive and spread in other species (Kim et al., 2021). As a result, various strains of avian influenza viruses have been identified in marine mammals, terrestrial poultry, horses, dogs, pigs, and notably, humans (Lloren et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2021; Kok et al., 2023).The patient in Yunnan not only exhibited infection with the H10N3 subtype of influenza A virus but also presented with a mixed infection involving drug-resistance bacteria and fungi, making the condition complex. It’s worth noting that severe pneumonia patients infected with avian influenza often experience concurrent or secondary bacterial and fungal infections (Chow et al., 2019). Therefore, it is recommended to conduct repeated sputum culture, respiratory tract aspirate culture, or mNGS detection in clinical settings to identify the types of bacteria or fungi present, as well as their susceptibility or resistance patterns. This approach enables clinicians to make informed decisions regarding antibiotic selection and guide appropriate clinical treatment strategies.The clinical manifestations of avian influenza A virus infection vary depending on the virus subtypes involved. For instance, infection with H5N1 and H7N9 subtypes can lead to severe pneumonia and related complications in patients. Conversely, certain subtypes such as H7 and H9 may only induce conjunctivitis or mild respiratory symptoms (Liu et al., 2013). It’s important for healthcare providers to be aware of these differences in clinical presentation when diagnosing and managing cases of avian influenza virus infection. As of now, only two cases of human infection with the H10N3 subtype have been reported. The symptoms observed in the patient infected with H10N3 in this case closely resemble those documented in the two previously known cases of H10N3 infection. Notably, all cases resulted in severe pneumonia in the affected patients (Qi et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023).However, the molecular features of these cases are different, and our case has some different mutations. The Q226L mutation makes the virus more adept at binding to human α-2,6-sialic acid receptors, significantly increasing the likelihood of human infection (Shi et al., 2014). The mutation D701N in the PB2 protein has been shown to enhance the replication activity of avian influenza RNA polymerase within the human body. This mutation also increases the adaptability and pathogenicity of the virus to the human host, potentially serving as a crucial factor in avian influenza viruses crossing the host species barrier (Li et al., 2005). The presence of the S409N mutation in the PA protein suggests the potential for infectivity in humans and may contribute to increased pathogenicity of this particular virus strain (Finkelstein et al., 2007). The S31N mutation in the M2 protein has been associated with resistance to adamantanes, a class of antiviral drugs (Pielak et al., 2009). This mutations in the protein of the Yunnan H10N3 virus strain underscores the potential for increased threat posed by H10N3 in humans. Therefore, it is imperative to closely monitor the dynamics of this subtype.The case of human infection with H10N3 avian influenza A virus highlighted in this study involved close contact with live birds, particularly through the handling and slaughtering of dead birds. Although there is no direct evidence, it is likely that this exposure eventually resulted in the patient contracting avian influenza and experiencing severe illness. This underscores the importance of paying special attention to instances of unexpected bird deaths and promptly reporting such cases. Moreover, it emphasizes the necessity of establishing a comprehensive avian influenza surveillance system, not only within Yunnan but also globally, to continuously and vigilantly monitor the H10N3 virus strain and its potential impact on human health.Data availability statementThe datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.

Your guide to warm weather illnessesHannah Yasharoff USA TODAYShow Caption Hide Caption US government to fund Moderna’s mRNA bird flu vaccine trialThe United States government is collaborating with Moderna to fund a human vaccine trial for bird flu (H5N1).Straight Arrow NewsThe flu has its own dedicated season, so it can be confusing to feel a fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose and other symptoms when you should be on summer vacation.If you have reason to believe you're coming down with the flu in the summer, you should also consider the possibility that it could instead be COVID-19 or another illness.Distinguishing between them "can be tricky since they share similar symptoms like fever, cough and fatigue," Dr. Jordan Wagner tells USA TODAY. "Diagnostic testing, including rapid flu tests and COVID-19 tests, is probably an individual’s best bet to confirm the specific virus causing the illness. Consulting a health care professional is essential for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management."If you do find yourself with flu-like symptoms in the summertime, here's what experts want you to know:Can you get the flu in the summer?The short answer is yes."Contracting the flu during spring and summer is less common than during the fall and winter," Wagner says. But that doesn't mean the chances are zero.Although flu season occurs during the colder months, seasonal influenza viruses are detected throughout the entire year in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The public health agency also notes that "timing and duration of flu activity has been less predictable" since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.More: COVID-19 is waning but these viruses are still hanging around in the springHow do you treat the summer flu? The summer flu is treated the same as a flu caught at any other time of year, Wagner says.Treatment "typically involves rest, hydration and over-the-counter medications to alleviate symptoms such as fever and body aches," he says. But he also recommends consulting a health care provider, "especially considering potential co-infections with seasonal viruses, to determine the most appropriate course of treatment."Another reason to check in with a doctor: Influenza antiviral drugs may be a course of treatment, and those work best when taken early, "ideally no later than two days after your flu symptoms begin," per the CDC.In the meantime, the CDC recommends you limit contact with other people as much as possible to prevent the flu from spreading further – stay home for at least 24 hours or until your symptoms are improving and you're fever-free without having to take medication.When it comes to preventing the flu – as well as COVID-19, colds and other illnesses – health experts note that habits such as regular hand-washing, covering your nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and other good hygiene practices can "significantly reduce the risk of contracting and spreading illnesses," Wagner says. CDC guidelines recommend annual flu vaccines for everyone over the age of 6."Staying informed about public health recommendations and promptly seeking medical attention if experiencing symptoms of flu or COVID-19 are essential steps in mitigating the spread of these viruses," Wagner adds.

This is according to a Dutch study led by University Medical Center (UMC) Utrecht among more than 23,000 adults who had a severe influenza infection between 2008 and 2019. To better protect adults without known cardiovascular disease from a heart attack after severe influenza, it should be investigated whether this group would benefit from temporary anticoagulation therapy.It is well-known that the risk of a heart attack is temporarily increased in the initial period after a severe acute respiratory tract infection. This is probably because such an infection disrupts blood clotting and causes the release of pro-inflammatory molecules. As a result, atherosclerotic plaques become unstable, pieces become detached and these subsequently cause a blockage of a coronary artery. Therefore, in the Netherlands patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or people at increased risk of a heart attack (such as those with thrombosis, diabetes or hypertension) receive an annual invitation for an influenza vaccination. Most of them also take anticoagulants and blood pressure medication to lower their heart attack risk. However, it is not clear what effect a severe influenza infection has on the risk of a heart attack in adults without known CVD.Heart attack risk strongly increased in adults without known CVDResearchers at UMC Utrecht therefore analyzed the risk of heart attack in a national database among 23,405 adults aged 35 and older who had contracted a severe influenza infection (confirmed by a laboratory test) between 2008 and 2019. The study showed in the first week after a severe influenza infection there was a six-fold increased risk of a heart attack (relative risk 6.16, 95% confidence interval 4.11-9.24). However, in adults without previous hospitalization for heart problems, the risk of a heart attack was as much as 16 times higher, while the risk was only slightly increased in patients with CVD. The researchers explain the observed lower risk of a heart attack in patients with CVD because they already take medications that lower the risk of a heart attack such as anticoagulants and blood pressure-lowering drugs.In addition to an increased risk for heart attack after a severe influenza infection, the study found that the risk of a heart attack was also increased after a severe infection with the RS virus or other respiratory viruses.Temporary anticoagulation treatmentPrincipal investigator Patricia Bruijning-Verhagen, MD PhD, professor of vaccination and infection control epidemiology (Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, UMC Utrecht) says: "Our study is the first to convincingly demonstrate that adults without known CVD are temporarily at increased risk of a heart attack after a severe influenza infection. To better protect this group, we should investigate in a study if temporary anticoagulation therapy can prevent heart attacks. Patients with a history of CVD already receive such medication as standard, and our study shows that they are better protected. Therefore, adults without known CVD experiencing a severe influenza infection might benefit from temporary anticoagulation treatment to reduce their heart attack risk. In addition, this study also highlights the importance of the flu vaccination to prevent severe disease. The average age in our study was 74 years, whereas in the Netherlands we invite everyone over 60 to annual flu vaccination."PublicationBoer AR de, Riezebos-Brilman A, Hout D van, Mourik MSM van, Rümke LW, Hoog MLA de, Vaartjes I, Bruijning-Verhagen PCJL, on behalf of the Influenza-MI Study Group.

Toggle navigation Objective 1: Strategic Implementation and Deployment of the U.S. National Pre-pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile (NPIVS) BARDA Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Strategy BARDA has established the Medical Countermeasures (MCMs) for Pandemic Influenza and Emerging Diseases Preparedness and Response Program, which includes administration of the U.S. National Pre-pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile (NPIVS). The NPIVS contains pre-pandemic influenza vaccine, contracts with domestic vaccine manufacturers, and procures vaccine to mitigate the public health impact of emerging disease threats. Unlike seasonal influenza vaccines, pandemic vaccines are given to an immunologically naïve population (all age groups) that require two doses of an adjuvanted vaccine for protection; the first dose to prime the immune system and the second to boost the immune response. Adjuvant is required for egg-, cell- and recombinant protein-based vaccines to achieve antigen-sparing and robust protection. Current Preparedness Activities Stockpiled H5Nx Vaccines The current NPIVS inventory includes several bulk lots of H5Nx antigen including for clade 2.3.4.4b, the clade responsible for the human cases in Colorado, Texas, and Michigan, as well as closely related 2.3.4.4a, c, f, and h clades. In 2022, BARDA awarded task orders to manufacture cGMP seed lots for egg-, cell- and recombinant protein-based vaccines for A/Astrakhan H5N8 and proactively manufacture A/American wigeon/SC H5N1 CGMP (cell-based) seed lot and bulk lot. As manufacturing and clinical testing remain significant bottlenecks in vaccine development, this advanced vaccine production has allowed rapid movement of these vaccines into clinical development. To further lean into preparedness for H5N1, BARDA finalized an agreement with CSL Seqirus in May 2024 to fill ~4.8 million additional doses of the bulk A/Astrakhan H5N8 vaccine into vials. Clinical Trials To generate the necessary clinical evidence to support regulatory approval, BARDA is currently supporting three clinical trials to evaluate vaccine candidates derived from A/Astrakhan H5N8: 1) a cell-based vaccine adjuvanted with MF59 from CSL Seqirus, 2) an egg-based vaccine adjuvanted with AS03 from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), and 3) an egg-based vaccine from Sanofi adjuvanted with either AS03 or MF59. The trials for CSL Seqirus and GSK are fully enrolled, while the trial for Sanofi will begin in Summer 2024 with safety data expected by Q4 2024. Future Research Priorities Expanded Capabilities – Immune Assays To rapidly respond to the emergence and spread of new strains of influenza virus or emerging infectious diseases with pandemic potential, capacity for rapid development, qualification, and validation of immunogenicity assays to support clinical trials that ensure pandemic readiness are needed. To achieve this, BARDA also seeks to partner with laboratories with existing capabilities to perform centralized immune assays using samples collected from nonclinical studies and from subjects enrolled in influenza vaccine clinical trials conducted under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational New Drug (IND) applications and to perform cross-reactive immune response testing of clinical samples for pandemic preparedness and response. Data from these assays may be used in primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoint analyses for vaccine clinical trials, cross-reactivity testing for pandemic readiness purposes, or perform correlates of protection analyses. Data may be used to support an FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) or a Biological License Application (BLA). Expanded Stockpile Capabilities – mRNA-based vaccines for pandemic influenza response The mRNA vaccine platform has unique advantages compared to current egg-, cell- and recombinant protein-based vaccines due to the short period of time needed for development and manufacturing of a vaccine against a novel virus. From the availability of the genetic sequence for a target antigen from an emerging pathogen, it takes only 14 weeks for an mRNA-based vaccine to be put into large-scale production. In particular, mRNA-based vaccine platforms can be switched to a new viral strain swiftly, which is an important attribute when responding to a new influenza strain that emerges and spreads rapidly. Finally, pandemic and seasonal influenza mRNA vaccines have identical supply chains whereas for egg-, cell- and recombinant protein-based vaccines require adjuvant components that are not widely used in seasonal influenza or other licensed vaccines, posing major challenges to the sustainability pandemic influenza vaccine preparedness programs. Currently, there is no licensed mRNA influenza vaccine for either seasonal or pandemic influenza. Since 2020, BARDA has funded development of several RNA-based influenza vaccine candidates, and in late 2023, BARDA released a solicitation “Accelerating Near-Term Availability of mRNA-based Pandemic Influenza Vaccine,” which seeks to partner with companies to fill the mRNA vaccine gap for influenza virus. In the future, BARDA will seek to incorporate licensed mRNA-based pandemic influenza vaccines for influenza viruses of pandemic potential, e.g., H5Nx and H7Nx, into the NPIVS, adding a more rapid option to the arsenal for the nation’s pandemic influenza preparedness and response. ​ BARDA Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Strategy BARDA Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Strategy Introduction Overview Objective 1: Strategic Implementation and Deployment of the U.S. National Pre-pandemic Influenza Vaccine Stockpile (NPIVS) Overview Current Preparedness Activities Future Research Priorities Objective 2: Enhanced Protection – Improved Vaccines against Pandemic Influenza Overview Current Preparedness Activities Future Research Priorities Objective 3: Therapeutics – deployment, early availability, and novel development Overview Current Preparedness Activities Future Research Priorities Objective 4: Diagnostic Overview Current Preparedness Ongoing & Future Research Priorities Home Contact Us ASPR Archive Accessibility Privacy Policies Disclaimer HHS Viewers & Players HHS Plain Language FOIA Vulnerability Disclosure Policy HHS, Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) 200 Independence Ave., Washington, DC 20201How CDC Estimates the Burden of Flu Prevented by Vaccination | Flu Burden | CDC Skip directly to site content Skip directly to search An official website of the United States government Here's how you know Official websites use .gov A .gov website belongs to an official government organization in the United States.

Overview CDC estimates the total number of flu illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths prevented by vaccination using a model that incorporates season-specific data on burden of disease, vaccine coverage and vaccine effectiveness (VE) for five age groups. More detailed description of the method can be found in an article by Tokars, et al1. CDC uses the annual estimates of influenza (flu) vaccination coverage by month during each season, and the final end-of-season vaccine effectiveness measurements to estimate how many people did not get a flu vaccine and were not protected by vaccine from an influenza virus infection (or were “unprotected” from flu) during the season. The rate of each outcome (illnesses, medical visits, hospitalizations, or deaths) among unprotected people is calculated and then used to estimate the number of flu-related outcomes that would have been expected in the population if no one had been protected by flu vaccination. Finally, the outcomes prevented by flu vaccination are calculated as the difference between outcomes in the hypothetical unvaccinated population and the observed vaccinated population. Estimates of flu vaccination coverage by month were based on self-report or parental report of vaccination status using data from the National Immunization Survey for children aged 6 months-17 years and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey data for adults 18 years and older.2 Vaccine effectiveness estimates for each season are derived from existing CDC flu vaccine effectiveness networks.3 These networks estimate the effectiveness of vaccination for preventing flu diagnosed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction-positive testing among persons with acute respiratory illness of ≤7 days duration seen in hospitals, emergency departments, or outpatient clinics in the United States. Calculations were stratified by month of the year to account for annual variations in the timing of disease and vaccination and then summed across the whole season. How flu burden is estimated Rates of laboratory-confirmed flu-related hospitalization by age group were obtained from FluSurv-NET, a collaboration between CDC, the Emerging Infections Program Network, and selected state and local health departments in 14 geographically distributed areas in the United States that conduct population-based flu surveillance. Reported hospitalization rates were adjusted using a multiplier to correct for underreporting, which is calculated from the percent of people hospitalized with respiratory illness who were tested for flu and the average sensitivity of flu tests used in the surveillance hospitals. The percentage of people hospitalized and tested for flu was measured from data collected each season since the 2010-2011 flu season. When adjusting the hospitalization rates, testing data from prior seasons is used until testing data from that specific season is available usually 2 years after the season ends. Adjusted rates were applied to the U.S. population by age group to calculate the numbers of flu-related hospitalizations. The numbers of flu illnesses were then estimated from hospitalizations based on previously measured ratios that reflect the estimated number of ill persons per hospitalization in each age group.4 The number of people seeking medical care for flu were then calculated using age group-specific data on the percentages of people with a respiratory illness who sought medical care, which was estimated from results of the 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey.5 All estimates were rounded to two significant digits.

Chesapeake Bay Program/Flickr cc In related developments, Iowa yesterday became the latest state to announce new testing requirements for dairy cattle participating in state exhibitions and fairs. The order goes into effect on July 1.In an update announcing the testing requirement, the state's agriculture secretary Mike Naig reiterated a request for USDA support for affected farms and thanked Iowa farmers for their cooperation with testing and research efforts. Officials said the USDA has authorized more epidemiological strike teams to help with investigations on affected poultry and dairy farms. More detections in cats, other mammals, wild birdsAPHIS today added reports of nine more H5N1 detections in mammals across four states, of which five were domestic cats. The infected cats were from Minnesota (Kandiyohi County) and Texas (Hartley County). Other detections involved raccoons from Michigan and New Mexico, a striped skunk for New Mexico, and a red fox from Minnesota.The group also added eight more detections in wild birds, including five bald eagles from Iowa, New Jersey, and Virginia and three agency-harvested birds from New Mexico. Quick takes: AI for antibiotic discovery, bedaquiline gets traditional approval, oral antifungal shows promise News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Fungal Infection Tuberculosis Drugmaker Eli Lilly announced yesterday that it will collaborate with artificial intelligence (AI) company OpenAI in an effort to identify new antimicrobials. In a press release, the company said it will use OpenAI's generative AI to invent novel antimicrobials to treat drug-resistant pathogens. "Our collaboration with OpenAI represents a groundbreaking step forward in the fight against the growing but overlooked threat of antimicrobial resistance," said Diogo Rau, MS, executive vice president and chief information and digital officer at Lilly. "Generative AI opens a new opportunity to accelerate the discovery of novel antimicrobials and the development of custom, purpose-built technologies in the battle against drug-resistant pathogens."The US Food and Drug Administration last week converted the tuberculosis (TB) drug Sirturo (bedaquiline) from accelerated approval to traditional approval. The FDA said in a news release that it made the decision after determining a confirmatory clinical study required under the accelerated approval pathway verified the clinical benefits of the drug, which is a key component of the regimens for rifampicin-resistant and multidrug-resistant TB. In a study published this week in Open Forum Infectious Diseases, researchers from the University of Michigan Medical School report promising results from five case studies involving the use of MAT2203, an investigational oral formulation of the antifungal amphotericin B (AmB) that is currently available under a compassionate-use program. The drug, which has lower toxicity than intravenous AmB, cured fungal infections in four patients and led to improvement in one patient, with only modest gastrointestinal side effects. "It appears to provide a safer treatment option for patients requiring therapy for AmB for weeks to months, and the oral formulation allows patients to be treated in the outpatient setting," the study authors wrote.

Overview Because surveillance systems tracking flu do not capture every flu-related illness, medical visit, hospitalization or death in the United States, CDC feels it is important to estimate and convey the full burden of seasonal flu and the impact of flu vaccination. To do this, CDC uses well-established scientific methods that have been reviewed by scientists outside of CDC to make comprehensive estimates of how flu vaccination affects the total numbers of flu illnesses, flu-related hospitalizations, and flu-related deaths that occur each season. By comparing the burden of flu illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths prevented by flu vaccination each season, CDC can better understand and communicate the benefits of flu vaccination. Estimates of the burden of flu prevented due to vaccination provide clear evidence on the public health impact that flu vaccination can have in terms of reducing the burden of flu each season. These estimates underscore the important benefits provided by flu vaccination, which has been recommended annually in the United States for all people 6 months and older since the 2010-2011 flu season. In addition to quantifying the benefits of flu vaccination each season, these estimates also highlight areas where improvements in flu vaccine uptake and vaccine effectiveness could deliver even greater benefits to the public's health.

A recent Nature Communications study characterizes influenza viruses, with a particular focus on the α-H1N2 virus, to determine their potential to cause a future pandemic. Study: Potential pandemic risk of circulating swine H1N2 influenza viruses. Image Credit: Fahroni / Shutterstock.com The evolution of swine flu Influenza viruses possess the ability to evolve specific traits, which facilitates persistent transmission to new species. Although wild aquatic birds are the primary natural reservoir for these virus, pigs can also act as critical hosts and mixing vessel for viral gene segments of IAVs. This poses a threat to future pandemics, thus emphasizing the importance of monitoring and characterizing circulating swine viruses. Neuraminidase (NA) and hemagglutinin (HA), which evolve seasonally due to antigenic drift, are key determinants of virus transmissibility, infectivity, host specificity, and pathogenicity. Three endemic IAV subtypes, including swH1N1, swH1N2, and swH3N2, predominate in swine. The H1 classical swine lineage (1A) comprises the α-H1 (1A.1), β-H1 (1A.2), and γ-H1 (1A.3) clades, whereas the swine lineage (1B) includes the δ-H1 (1B.2) clades. In the United States, human infections have been primarily due to 18 H1N1, 35 H1N2, and 439 H3N2. A reassortment between swine-, avian-, and human-origin viruses has been observed in recent swine IAVs. The antigenic drift of HA and NA may also lead to the emergence of novel viruses that the human population lacks immunity against. About the study The current study created a decision tree to aid in characterizing and assessing the pandemic risk of endemic swine IAVs. The decision tree utilizes the extensive research conducted since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic using both in vitro and in vivo methods. The current study determines the pandemic potential of an α-H1 (1A.1.1.3) clade strain A/swine/Texas/A02245420/2020 (α-swH1N2) and the γ-H1 (1A.3.3.3) clade strain A/swine/Minnesota/A02245409/2020 (γ-swH1N1). These clades were selected because of their geographical distribution, detection frequency, interspecies transmission from pigs to ferrets, reported human variant events, and loss in cross-reactivity against human seasonal vaccines. Study findings Previous studies have shown that representatives of the α-swH1N2 clade had antigenic distance from human vaccine strains, which led to differential transmission from pigs to ferrets and lower recognition by the human sera. Consequently, cross-neutralizing antibodies against α-swH1N2 in H1N1pdm09- or H3N2-imm ferrets were not detected in human sera, thus indicating that initial seasonal virus infection did not generate immunity. Related StoriesNew insights into family adaptation in Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemicStudy confirms flu vaccine effectiveness against A H1N1 in young childrenStudy reveals how COVID-19 affected the spread and evolution of seasonal influenzaVariable levels of anti-N2 antibodies were identified in human sera across all birth years. This finding implies that some level of protection could be provided by this NA-based immunity, at least in some sub-populations. Prior research by researchers of the current study demonstrated that previously acquired immunity could affect the susceptibility to heterosubtypic viruses and that neutralizing antibodies do not mediate this type of immunity. Therefore, previously acquired immunity through divergent strains could influence the susceptibility of ambient viruses. In fact, α-swH1N2 was efficiently transmitted through the air to ferrets, irrespective of their immune status. However, the severity of the disease was lower in animals with prior immunity. A similar phenomenon could explain the lower-than-expected mortality and morbidity during the 2009 pandemic. In the absence of neutralizing antibodies, CD8+ T-cells can confer protection against emerging influenza virus strains, as these cells recognize internally conserved influenza virus proteins. In fact, CD8+ T-cells with cross-reactivity against subtypes of the influenza virus have provided rapid recovery from illness and more efficient clearance of the virus. No protective effect of immunity to human seasonal viruses was noted with regard to α-swH1N2 airborne infection. Nevertheless, infected ferrets with prior immunity were found to successfully and rapidly eliminate α-swH1N2 while also exhibiting reduced overall virus shedding time and less severe symptoms as a result of H1N1pdm09 immunity. Nevertheless, ferrets were still able to transmit H1N1pdm0 with an efficiency of 50%. Thus, H1N1pdm0 can spread undetected due to the lack of disease severity in immune animals and, as a result, create pandemic risk. Conclusions The study findings demonstrate that the α-swH1N2 virus strain poses a higher pandemic risk than the γ-swH1N1 strain, thus necessitating the need for additional surveillance efforts to detect zoonotic events in a timely manner. Additionally, more vaccination campaigns should be launched to protect swine from this H1 clade, which should aid in reducing viral circulation in source populations.

A recent Nature Communications study characterizes influenza viruses, with a particular focus on the α-H1N2 virus, to determine their potential to cause a future pandemic. Study: Potential pandemic risk of circulating swine H1N2 influenza viruses. Image Credit: Fahroni / Shutterstock.com The evolution of swine flu Influenza viruses possess the ability to evolve specific traits, which facilitates persistent transmission to new species. Although wild aquatic birds are the primary natural reservoir for these virus, pigs can also act as critical hosts and mixing vessel for viral gene segments of IAVs. This poses a threat to future pandemics, thus emphasizing the importance of monitoring and characterizing circulating swine viruses. Neuraminidase (NA) and hemagglutinin (HA), which evolve seasonally due to antigenic drift, are key determinants of virus transmissibility, infectivity, host specificity, and pathogenicity. Three endemic IAV subtypes, including swH1N1, swH1N2, and swH3N2, predominate in swine. The H1 classical swine lineage (1A) comprises the α-H1 (1A.1), β-H1 (1A.2), and γ-H1 (1A.3) clades, whereas the swine lineage (1B) includes the δ-H1 (1B.2) clades. In the United States, human infections have been primarily due to 18 H1N1, 35 H1N2, and 439 H3N2. A reassortment between swine-, avian-, and human-origin viruses has been observed in recent swine IAVs. The antigenic drift of HA and NA may also lead to the emergence of novel viruses that the human population lacks immunity against. About the study The current study created a decision tree to aid in characterizing and assessing the pandemic risk of endemic swine IAVs. The decision tree utilizes the extensive research conducted since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic using both in vitro and in vivo methods. The current study determines the pandemic potential of an α-H1 (1A.1.1.3) clade strain A/swine/Texas/A02245420/2020 (α-swH1N2) and the γ-H1 (1A.3.3.3) clade strain A/swine/Minnesota/A02245409/2020 (γ-swH1N1). These clades were selected because of their geographical distribution, detection frequency, interspecies transmission from pigs to ferrets, reported human variant events, and loss in cross-reactivity against human seasonal vaccines. Study findings Previous studies have shown that representatives of the α-swH1N2 clade had antigenic distance from human vaccine strains, which led to differential transmission from pigs to ferrets and lower recognition by the human sera. Consequently, cross-neutralizing antibodies against α-swH1N2 in H1N1pdm09- or H3N2-imm ferrets were not detected in human sera, thus indicating that initial seasonal virus infection did not generate immunity. Related StoriesNew insights into family adaptation in Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemicStudy confirms flu vaccine effectiveness against A H1N1 in young childrenStudy reveals how COVID-19 affected the spread and evolution of seasonal influenzaVariable levels of anti-N2 antibodies were identified in human sera across all birth years. This finding implies that some level of protection could be provided by this NA-based immunity, at least in some sub-populations. Prior research by researchers of the current study demonstrated that previously acquired immunity could affect the susceptibility to heterosubtypic viruses and that neutralizing antibodies do not mediate this type of immunity. Therefore, previously acquired immunity through divergent strains could influence the susceptibility of ambient viruses. In fact, α-swH1N2 was efficiently transmitted through the air to ferrets, irrespective of their immune status. However, the severity of the disease was lower in animals with prior immunity. A similar phenomenon could explain the lower-than-expected mortality and morbidity during the 2009 pandemic. In the absence of neutralizing antibodies, CD8+ T-cells can confer protection against emerging influenza virus strains, as these cells recognize internally conserved influenza virus proteins. In fact, CD8+ T-cells with cross-reactivity against subtypes of the influenza virus have provided rapid recovery from illness and more efficient clearance of the virus. No protective effect of immunity to human seasonal viruses was noted with regard to α-swH1N2 airborne infection. Nevertheless, infected ferrets with prior immunity were found to successfully and rapidly eliminate α-swH1N2 while also exhibiting reduced overall virus shedding time and less severe symptoms as a result of H1N1pdm09 immunity. Nevertheless, ferrets were still able to transmit H1N1pdm0 with an efficiency of 50%. Thus, H1N1pdm0 can spread undetected due to the lack of disease severity in immune animals and, as a result, create pandemic risk. Conclusions The study findings demonstrate that the α-swH1N2 virus strain poses a higher pandemic risk than the γ-swH1N1 strain, thus necessitating the need for additional surveillance efforts to detect zoonotic events in a timely manner. Additionally, more vaccination campaigns should be launched to protect swine from this H1 clade, which should aid in reducing viral circulation in source populations.

The change will reimburse a portion of financial losses when cattle are removed from milking herds due to confirmed H5N1 test results.USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack said, "When something unexpected, like H5N1, threatens the economic viability of the producers we serve, we are committed to finding ways, where we have the authority to do so, to revisit existing program policies and provide the financial support needed to help producers recover and sustain production." ELAP is designed to provide relief to producers that aren't covered by other disaster-assistance programs. Eligible cattle must be part of herds confirmed as H5N1-positive by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory, be removed from production during a specified period, be currently lactating, and be maintained for commercial milk production. The USDA said it would base the per-cow loss payment on an expected 21-day period of no milk production, followed by 7 days when the cow has returned to 50% of the normal rate of production. More confirmations in dairy herds, cats, and poultryIn related developments, the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) added three more dairy herds to its list of confirmed H5N1 outbreaks, raising the total to 132 from 12 states. The confirmations include two from Colorado and one from Iowa.APHIS also added two more H5N1 confirmations in domestic cats to its list of infected mammals, both from New Mexico's Curry County. Samples were collected in March and April.Meanwhile, the group added one more detection in a poultry flock, a noncommercial facility in Minnesota that houses 310 birds. The location is Stearns County, in the central part of the state.

Back to Healio Key takeaways:Since May 2023, a combination of neuraminidase mutations has been detected in influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. The mutated viruses have a 13-fold reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir.A novel combination of neuraminidase mutations detected in influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses on several continents has left these viruses less susceptible to treatment with oseltamivir, researchers found.“Some mutations in the genes of influenza viruses can reduce the effectiveness of available antiviral medications. Therefore, scientists continuously monitor circulating influenza viruses for such mutations,” Larisa V. Gubareva, MD, PhD, team lead of the Influenza Division at the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told Healio. Researchers have found influenza viruses on five continents that are resistant to oseltamivir, according to a study. Image: Adobe Stock “During routine monitoring of influenza viruses, CDC laboratory observed a previously unseen combination of two mutations in the neuraminidase of a seasonal virus named A(H1N1)pdm09 collected in the United States in October 2023,” she said.According to Gubareva, how this combination of mutations affects an antiviral’s ability to inhibit the neuraminidase was not known. She said, though, laboratory testing showed that the virus was found to be about 13 times less sensitive to oseltamivir than viruses without this combination of mutations. “Upon further analysis of genetic sequences of viruses submitted to CDC by U.S. state public health laboratories and other international laboratories, we detected 16 additional A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses with this combination of mutations,” Gubareva said, noting that these viruses were collected from four other countrieserritories, including Bangladesh, Hong Kong, Maldives, and Niger, between August and November of 2023. “This study was extended to determine how broadly viruses with these mutations were circulating worldwide, as well as how such viruses emerged,” she said.Between May 2023 and February 2024, the researchers analyzed 2,039 pH1N1 viruses from the U.S. (n = 1,274) and 38 other countries (n = 765), of which four had the H275Y substitution, indicating low frequency of oseltamivir resistance. Additionally, neuraminidase substitution of I223V was revealed in 18 and S247N in 15, indicating “mildly elevated” oseltamivir resistance. The researchers also detected 17 viruses carrying both I223V and S247N substitutions. Among these, viruses with single mutations exhibited normal inhibition by oseltamivir, whereas the six viruses with both I223V and S247N mutations displayed 13- to 16-fold less sensitive to oseltamivir and normal inhibition (less than fourfold) for other neuraminidase inhibitors. The researchers noted, though, that both single and dual mutants remained susceptible to the polymerase cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir. Looking specifically at viruses with dual mutations, the researchers determined that the first dual mutant was collected from Canada in May 2023 and the latest were collected from France, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom between January and February 2024. The Netherlands had the most cases of viruses with dual mutants (n = 30), followed by France (n = 24), Bangladesh (n = 11), Oman (n = 9) and the United Kingdom (n = 9). Additional cases were found in Hong Kong (n = 4), Niger (n = 3), Australia (n = 2), Spain (n = 2), and the U.S. (n = 2), with single cases also being detected in Canada, Ethiopia, Maldives, Norway and Sweden.“This report conveys our concerns about a multicountry detection of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses with a previously unseen combination of mutations that were naturally acquired,” Gubareva said. “In a laboratory test, these viruses were found to be about 13 times less sensitive to oseltamivir than those without this combination of mutations. However, mutated viruses retained sensitivity to other available anti-influenza medications, including the newer antiviral, baloxavir marboxil.”Gubareva added that there are no immediate implications with regard to clinical care decisions at this time, although it is currently unknown how widely these mutated viruses will circulate in the upcoming season.“Influenza vaccination is available and should offer protection from infections caused by viruses with and without these mutations,” she concluded.

Opens in a new tab or window Share on X. Opens in a new tab or window Share on LinkedIn. Opens in a new tab or window email article The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) endorsed new COVID-19 and influenza vaccines for the 2024-2025 respiratory virus season on Thursday. In a unanimous 11-0 vote, the ACIP recommend that everyone 6 months of age and older should receive an updated COVID-19 vaccine, similar to last year's recommendation. The committee also voted unanimously that everyone 6 months of age and older should receive an updated 2024-2025 influenza vaccine, with rare exceptions. Also, in another unanimous vote, members voted that high-dose inactivated (HD-IIV3) and adjuvanted inactivated (aIIV3) influenza vaccines are acceptable options for influenza vaccination in solid organ transplant recipients. Shortly after the meeting, CDC Director Mandy Cohen, MD, MPH, endorsed the recommendations. In a final unanimous vote, members recommended that the new 21-valent pneumococcal vaccine (PCV21; Capvaxive) is an option for adults ages 19 years and older who currently have a recommendation to receive a dose of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Clinical recommendations that explain the different options of pneumococcal vaccines will be forthcoming, committee members said. COVID Vaccines The most recent data, presented at the meeting, indicate that COVID-19 continues to take a significant toll on adults ages 65 and older and young infants. According to CDC data, more than 916,300 people were hospitalized in 2023 due to COVID-19 and more than 75,500 people died of COVID-19. From October 2023 through May 2024, population-based hospitalization rates among adults ages 75 and older were about 800-900 per 100,000 population -- more than three times as high as among adults ages 65 to 74, Fiona Havers, MD, MHS, of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told committee members. "Rates among adults ages 65 to 74 and infants less than 6 months of age have roughly equal rates," she pointed out. American Indian/Alaska Native, Hispanic, and Black populations were also more likely to be hospitalized for COVID-19 than whites during that time period. Adults ages 65 and older during that period comprised 82% of all in-hospital deaths, Havers noted. Waning patterns of the 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness in preventing critical illness appeared to be similar to previous vaccine formulations, reported Ruth Link-Gelles, PhD, MPH, of the CDC. For example, vaccine effectiveness in preventing hospitalization in adults decreased over time from about 49% at 7 to 59 days after vaccination to 14% at 120 to 179 days. "I think it's really important to keep in mind that this should be interpreted as incremental or additional effectiveness in a population with a lot of underlying immunity," Link-Gelles said, pointing to the fact that the majority of the population has had at least one COVID-19 infection along with multiple vaccinations. Earlier in June, an FDA advisory committee voted unanimously to recommend that the COVID-19 vaccines for the 2024-2025 season target a JN.1 lineage of the virus, though FDA recently advised vaccine makers to be even more specific and target its descendent KP.2 if possible. Updated COVID-19 vaccines will be available from Moderna, Novavax, and Pfizer later this year. ACIP's recommendation will take effect as soon as the new vaccines are available, the CDC said. Influenza Vaccines The committee reaffirmed that most individuals 6 months of age and older should receive an influenza vaccine. All influenza vaccines for the 2024-2025 season will be trivalent, and will protect against an H1N1, H3N2, and a B/Victoria lineage virus. The composition of this season's vaccine compared with last season's has also been updated with a new influenza A(H3N2) virus. In addition, the committee voted unanimously to recommend high-dose inactivated (HD-IIV3) and adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccines as options for solid organ transplant recipients ages 18 through 64 who are receiving immunosuppressive medication regimens, without a preference over another age-appropriate IIV3 or RIV3. Solid organ transplant recipients require lifelong immunosuppressive medications, making lower respiratory infections more severe, with high hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and mortality rates. "We believe that transplant patients really suffer from a lack of good protection from the lower standard dose [influenza] vaccine," commented ACIP member Camille Kotton, MD, of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, noting however that the high-dose influenza vaccine is not covered by insurance for many people with solid organ transplants because of age restrictions. "We've been in a situation where we have to fill out prior authorizations every single time you want to give an influenza vaccine. We're hoping that if we voted in favor of this change, that it would enhance equity and protection for this vulnerable population," she said. Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccines In a final vote of the day, the committee unanimously voted to recommend the new 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV21) as an option for adults ages 19 years or older who are already eligible to receive a dose of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. The vaccine recently received FDA approval for preventing invasive pneumococcal disease and pneumococcal pneumonia in adults ages 18 and older. Based on epidemiologic data from the CDC, the serotypes included in the vaccine together cause roughly 84% of the cases of invasive pneumococcal disease in adults 50 and older. By comparison, the 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV20) covers the serotypes responsible for 52% of cases in this age group. The single-dose vaccine contains eight unique serotypes that are not covered by other available vaccines (15A, 15C, 16F, 23A, 23B, 24F, 31, and 35B). The ACIP's Pneumococcal Vaccines Work Group agreed that available evidence supported the use of PCV21 for adults ages 19 or older who already have a recommendation to receive a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. However, despite the FDA approval for adults ages 50 and up, the Work Group could not reach a consensus on whether the current age-based recommendation for PCV21 should be lowered from adults ages 65 or older to adults 50 or older, without a risk-based indication. The committee did not recommend use of PCV21 among adults ages 19 to 49 who currently do not have a risk-based pneumococcal vaccine indication. Currently, the CDC recommends the PCV15 or PCV20 for adults who never received a PCV and are ages 65 years or older, or ages 19 through 64 with certain risk conditions. If PCV15 is used, it should be followed by a dose of PPSV23. Adults who received an earlier PCV (e.g., PCV7 or PCV13) should talk with a vaccine provider to consider available options to complete the pneumococcal vaccine series. Adults 65 or older have the option to get PCV20 if they have already received PCV13 (but not PCV15 or PCV20) at any age and PPSV23 at or after the age of 65. These adults can talk with a vaccine provider and decide, together, whether to get PCV20. Current recommendations for the pneumococcal vaccines are "just confusing," James Loehr, MD, chair of the Pneumococcal Vaccines Work Group group, told committee members. Despite acknowledging that lowering the eligible age for the PCV21 vaccine to age 50 would improve vaccine equity, "We were also torn by the confusion that would be in place if we lowered the recommendation for PCV21 to age 50, but not for PCV20, because then we would have three recommendations for people in their 50s," he said. The ACIP plans to revisit this issue at their October 2024 meeting. All recommendations from ACIP are not considered final until published in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.

Scott Nolen June 24, 2024 Updated June 26, 2024 The AVMA House of Delegates (HOD) on June 20 heard from colleagues representing agencies and organizations responding to a multistate outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), specifically avian influenza virus type A (H5N1). Speakers from the HOD’s House Advisory Panel and constituent allied veterinary organizations covered the current state of affairs and the challenges veterinarians in the poultry and dairy industries are facing, as well the efforts being taken to protect public and animal health. Dr. Katherine Weathers, a poultry veterinarian with more than two decades of experience dealing with avian influenza and delegate for the American Association of Avian Pathologists (AAAP) in the HOD, told the House what they can expect when it comes to these highly pathogenic viruses. “Avian influenza is not going away.” The spread of the avian influenza virus type A (H5N1) within and among dairy herds indicates that bovine-to-bovine spread occurs. Evidence also indicates that the virus can spread from dairy cattle premises to nearby poultry facilities. Potential risk factors for local transmission between facilities include shared personnel between premises, shared vehicles between premises, and frequent visitors on and off premises. The AAAP has developed specific tools to help producers deal with an HPAI outbreak. “AAAP members are responsible for the health and welfare of millions, if not billions, of poultry in this country and worldwide,” Dr. Weathers said, adding that the association has helped developed surveillance and biosecurity programs used by all the U.S. primary breeder flock producers, and for most of the commercial poultry produced nationally. “So, when we're talking about cattle and poultry active surveillance, poultry has already set the stage for what’s happening,” she said. The U.S. poultry industry is in its third year of a multistate outbreak of H5N1 viruses that have spilled over into roughly 200 mammal species. In March, the virus was identified for the first time in a herd of dairy cows in Texas. As of June 21, H5N1 infections had been confirmed in at least 112 dairy cattle herds in a dozen states: 25 each in Idaho and Michigan, 20 in Texas, 12 in Colorado, eight in New Mexico, seven in Iowa, six in Minnesota, five in South Dakota, four in Kansas, and one each in North Carolina, Ohio, and Wyoming. Dr. Sarah Tomlinson, representative for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) on the House Advisory Panel, opened the Thursday morning informational session, explaining that USDA scientists have determined through genetic analysis that a wild bird infected with H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13 is most likely responsible for the spillover event involving cattle. Dr. Sarah Tomlinson, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service representative on the AVMA House of Delegates’ House Advisory Panel, briefs delegates on the agency’s efforts to manage highly pathogenic avian influenza. “Over the last only 90 days, there has been a tremendous amount of work to learn about this emerging disease in cattle being conducted by producers and state and federal veterinarians,” she said. “We have conducted and administered epidemiology questionnaires,” said Dr. Tomlinson, who is a senior leader for Science and Information Technology for Veterinary Services within USDA APHIS. “We have done some on-farm intensive sampling. We have conducted wildlife and mature domestic species sampling on and around effected dairies, and we have now deployed three epidemiological strike teams.” Recent laboratory pathogenesis studies indicate lactating cows are by far the largest and most affected vector for this disease, she continued. “This continues to be a form of morbidity in dairy cattle with mortality rates, including culling, 2% or less on average,” she said. The disease is unpredictable, as it has shown up in asymptomatic dairy cattle, as well as those that show a high number of clinical signs over an extended period of time. Transmission appears to be multifactorial. APHIS has found that over half of affected premises are sharing equipment, such as trucks and trailers, and that three-quarters of affected premises have visitors who have frequent contact with the cattle. The H5N1 virus also appears to have some ability to infect humans. Three individuals exposed to infected cattle have been confirmed as infected, according to Dr. Casey Barton Behravesh, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) representative on the House Advisory Panel. Dr. Behravesh, director of CDC’s One Health Office, explained that conjunctivitis was the common clinical indication in all three cases, while the third affected individual also showed signs of respiratory illness. “Thankfully, there’s been no human-to-human spread detected to date, but that's something we continue to watch closely for and want to stay ahead of the curve on,” she said. The CDC is conducting genetic sequencing of the virus from all human cases, and doing comparative analyses between human and animal sequences to assess the viruses for genetic changes that could indicate if the virus is adapting and spreading more easily, she continued. “Today, there have been no changes detected that indicate the virus is more likely to transmit better from animals to people or from person-to-person,” Dr. Behravesh said. “And there's no indication that the virus would be resistant to antivirals or effective vaccines or diagnostics at this time.” Concerning the safety of U.S. food supply, Dr. Thomas Vermeersch said, “The USDA is confident that the meat supply is safe, and part of that confidence is due to the fact that we have a rigorous meat inspection process associated with the release of meat for commerce.” Dr. Vermeersh is the policy development division staff officer for USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), which he represents on the House Advisory Panel. He recounted how the USDA initiated three separate beef safety studies concerning avian influenza and meat from dairy cattle. One study using samples from ground beef obtained from retail outlets in the states in which dairy cattle herds tested positive for H5N1 influenza virus found no viral particles to be present in the beef. Two additional studies provided further evidence of a safe U.S. meat supply, according to Dr. Vermeesh. Dr. Tristan Colonius of the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine said research indicates that the commercial pasteurized dairy supply is also safe. “The good news is that the data is stacking up and (pasteurization) continues to work well against this virus,” said Dr. Colonius. The FDA is working closely with its partners to understand and fill data and research gaps concerning the virus. For example, the agency is working with the USDA to test samples of pooled raw milk to characterize potential H5N1 levels and replicating commercial conditions of grade A milk production to further validate pasteurization. Additionally, the FDA intends to support additional One Health research on interventions to prevent, control, or eliminate H5N1, with results becoming available soon, he said.

(All-American Dairy Show)MADISON, Wis. — The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCP) is requiring Influenza A testing prior to movement of lactating dairy cattle to fairs or exhibitions became effective on June 19, 2024. This goal of this state orderis to prevent the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) (H5N1) in dairy cattle. While this effort seeks to limit the spread of the disease, further prevention efforts are advised as there is risk of disease transmission anytime animals are commingled. DATCP continues to update the frequently asked questions document on the state order. Access the FAQ here. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) has now confirmed the presence of HPAI (H5N1) in more than 120 dairy herds in 12 states including Iowa, Michigan, and Minnesota. Access the full list of H5N1 detections in livestock. To date, there have not been any detections of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) (H5N1) in Wisconsin cattle, poultry, or wildlife with the genotype associated with dairy cattle detections in other states. Producers should continue to enhance their biosecurity efforts and monitor and control disease in their herds and flocks. DATCP is closely monitoring HPAI (H5N1) in dairy cattle and continues to encourage producers that notice unusual clinical signs in their cattle to work with their herd veterinarian. To report herds with unexplained symptoms, veterinarians should contact DATCP at (608) 224-4872 (business hours) or (800) 943-0003 (after hours and weekends).

CDC also helps strengthen the connection between clinics and laboratories by ensuring human resources are available to train, mentor, and supervise continuous quality improvement initiatives at healthcare facilities and laboratories. Disease surveillance CDC supports local implementing partners to conduct research that informs South Africa’s HIV response and programs. This research includes: Population surveys to understand HIV prevalence and incidence. Enhanced antenatal surveys in pregnant women. HIV drug resistance surveillance. HIV mortality surveillance. For key population groups, CDC also supports size estimations and bio-behavioral surveys that inform HIV epidemic surveillance, programs, and epidemiological models used by: The South African Government. The United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). A network of nongovernmental organizations, advocacy groups, and community groups. Workforce development CDC helped launch the South Africa Field Epidemiology Training Program in 2006 in collaboration with NDOH, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), the University of Pretoria, and Wits University. The trains epidemiologists to prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks before they become epidemics. Participants develop skills for gathering data and translating data into evidence-based action. CDC continues to support and expand South Africa's FETP, including Frontline, Intermediate, and Advanced levels. All three FETP levels have participated in the COVID-19 response in South Africa. Key achievements CDC has collaborated with the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) to conduct national HIV household surveys since 2005. CDC supported the implementation and expansion of the Synchronized Communication in Health, a web-based system that ensures data accessibility and reporting across models of care in 2018. CDC used the Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes platform to train 2,000 pathologists in virology, chemistry, microbiology, and genetics in 2021. More than 500 professionals have graduated from FETP since 2007. Of those, 344 professionals have completed Frontline-FETP, 27 professionals have completed Intermediate-FETP, and 344 professionals have completed Advanced-FETP. COVID-19 Strategic focus CDC implemented a broad and proactive public health response to prepare, detect, and respond to COVID-19. CDC engaged in technical collaboration with the NDOH and NICD on disease surveillance, laboratory strengthening, and health communication. As cases increased, CDC expanded its scope of work to include: Supporting surveillance and epidemiology. Strengthening laboratory capacity. Researching COVID-19 burden, transmission, seroprevalence, and morbidity. Strengthening border health, risk communication, and vaccine preparedness and delivery. Strengthening epidemiologic capacity through FETP courses. All COVID-19 programs balance existing CDC and South African structures and partnerships. This includes those from the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and influenza surveillance. Key achievements CDC supported establishment of COVID-19 surveillance systems in all nine provinces by adapting existing influenza and respiratory disease surveillance platforms. CDC assisted national- and provincial-level COVID-19 response teams with disease surveillance early in the COVID-19 response. CDC helped strengthen COVID-19 genomic sequencing capabilities at the NICD to identify emerging variants in South Africa and the surrounding region. CDC helped increase COVID-19 vaccination in mobile clinics and PEPFAR-supported facilities Distributed over 2 million vaccine education pamphlets in each PEPFAR-supported district. Transcript Low Resolution Video HIV and TB Strategic focus South Africa has the highest number of people living with HIV in the world, accounting for nearly 1 in 5 people living with HIV globally. Through PEPFAR, CDC works with partners toward HIV epidemic control in South Africa. CDC and South Africa strategically support HIV prevention and treatment programs and system strengthening. Through PEPFAR, CDC leads efforts to increase voluntary medical male circumcision among men aged 15 years and older. CDC supports pre-exposure prophylaxis for key populations and provides comprehensive services for: Sex workers. Men who have sex with men. Transgender people. People who inject drugs. People in prisons. CDC also supports HIV programs designed for adolescent girls and young women aged 15-24 years. Compared to male peers, adolescent girls and young women are 2.5 times more likely to be infected with HIV. Women and girls account for 3 out of every 4 new HIV infections in the 15-24 age group. To address complex factors that increase risk of HIV infection among adolescent and young women, CDC implements the Determined Resilient Empowered AIDS-free Mentored Safe (DREAMS) program. DREAMS includes multiple evidence-based activities such as: Post-violence care. Parenting/caregiver programs. Facilitating access to existing resources such as cash transfers and education subsidies. Did you know?‎ CDC supported HSRC to conduct the sixth South African National HIV Prevalence, Incidence, Behavior and Communication Surveys (SABSSM) between January 2022 and April 2023.SABSSM VI is a cross-sectional population-based household survey designed to provide information on key HIV indicators, social and behavioral factors, and access to medical interventions in South Africa. Key achievements CDC supported antiretroviral therapy (ART) services for over 2 million people living with HIV. About 76% of people living with HIV received ART and 93% of people receiving ART achieved viral load suppression. Mother-to-child transmission of HIV decreased to less than 1% at birth from 3.5% in 2010. CDC's implementing partners achieved 99% coverage of HIV testing among pregnant women and initiated treatment for 99% of pregnant women living with HIV. Keep Reading: HIV and TB Overview: South Africa Influenza Influenza viruses require continued vigilance to mitigate seasonal influenza and novel strains. CDC South Africa's Influenza Program is a regional hub that provides technical support to surrounding countries to prevent, control, and respond to influenza. CDC’s influenza work at its Influenza Regional Hub in South Africa is focused on enhanced surveillance and laboratory capacity for seasonal influenza viruses and novel influenza viruses with pandemic potential and generating the evidence-base for policy decisions. Since 2007, CDC has worked with partners to enhance the quality of influenza surveillance and broaden the scope to include other respiratory pathogens, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and SARS-CoV-2. CDC collaborates on research projects to understand influenza and other respiratory viruses in South Africa, where disease burden and epidemiology may be unique due to untreated comorbidities such as tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV, as well as malnutrition and socioeconomic factors. CDC also engages in other research efforts, including: Studying how flu and SARS-CoV-2 spread within households. Surveying healthcare use for respiratory illness. Assessing if a children's flu vaccine study is practical. Key achievements CDC supported enhanced surveillance for lower respiratory tract infections and influenza-like illnesses. This was done by expanding existing platforms to include RSV, pertussis, and COVID-19. In 2019, CDC published estimates of health and economic burden of severe pneumonia caused by influenza and other respiratory pathogens in South Africa.

Back to Healio Key takeaways:Bird flu has affected more than 97 million birds and 131 dairy herds in the U.S.The usefulness of vaccinating birds and cows remains under debate.Avian influenza continues to be detected among birds and dairy cows in the United States, raising questions about how to control the more than 2-year-old outbreak.According to the CDC, highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) — also called bird flu — has affected more than 97 million wild aquatic birds, commercial poultry and backyard flocks since January 2022, with more than 1,150 outbreaks in 526 counties across all 50 states. H5N1 has also been detected in 131 dairy herds in 12 states. Four people in the U.S. have been infected with H5N1, including three this year — all of whom were exposed to infected dairy cows, according to the CDC.We reached out to Maurice Pitesky, DVM, MPVM, BMEA, a faculty member at the University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine-Cooperative Extension, to answer some of our lingering questions about H5N1, including whether it is possible to control the outbreak by vaccinating birds and cows. The answers have been lightly edited for clarity and length. Healio: Are there vaccines to prevent H5N1 spread in bird flocks and cow herds? Pitesky: Yes. The Chinese use them. The French are starting to explore them. We know from our COVID experience that vaccines are not a panacea, and there are scientific challenges. There are economic and political challenges. Scientifically, the big issue is that, just like with COVID-19, the vaccines protect against disease but don't protect against infection. The worry is that you could have asymptomatic spread of the virus, and that can be dangerous. One of the nice things about clinical signs is that you know there’s an infection. We need to do necropsies on these birds to determine what's wrong with them because once we know that there's a problem, then we can really work on euthanasia, quarantine, the type of interventions that ultimately help prevent the spread of the virus. Those are the scientific and logistical or infrastructural-type issues. On the political side, countries that vaccinate historically aren't allowed to trade internationally. The United States is a huge exporter of poultry products, mainly on the chicken broiler side. There are economic and political considerations there that are still kind of challenging. This outbreak is so significant that the powers that be are reconsidering that kind of generic policy. I don't think we've really finalized the minutiae on that but there definitely is some movement in that direction.Also, the vaccines are good, but they're not perfect. The French have used them in ducks, for example, to some success and some failure. The question is: If you vaccinate, and you vaccinate again, and you still get clinical signs, what are you ultimately doing? What did you accomplish by vaccinating those birds if they eventually get infected with the virus? Healio: Is it reasonable or possible to vaccinate entire flocks or herds? Pitesky: Vaccination is easy; immunization is hard. Giving a vaccine in drinking water for 10,000 birds — or 1 million birds, even — is not easy, per se, but we do that a lot in the poultry industry.Immunization is a little hard. We process 8 billion broiler chickens a year. There’s no way, logistically, that you can give them the two required doses. The logistics and economics of that is very challenging. When you’re dealing with that many broiler, that’s not trivial, and that’s expensive. And now companies and consumers ultimately are going to pay the price for that.[For birds that lay eggs], there might be a little more of a push to do that because layer birds, they’re not producing eggs for about 20 weeks or so. There’s much more value that you would ultimately get in protecting those birds vs. a broiler chicken, as opposed to vaccinating maybe 50 or 60 days before it’s ultimately processed.In my mind, and my bias with the work that I do, you really want to triage where you’re going to vaccinate and you want to understand where the risk is greatest. The main reservoir of the virus are wild waterfowl, like ducks and geese. You ultimately want to identify which locations are historically — and are forecasted to be — in the crosshairs of waterfowl habitat relative to these commercial poultry facilities. Then, companies can make a more nuanced decision about where they want to focus their vaccination resources. Healio: Are farmers willing, or would they be willing, to participate in a large-scale national vaccination program, or even just disease surveillance? Pitesky: Right now we’re dealing with something unprecedented, and farmers need help. Right now, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is helping with all of their resources, money and labor on what happens after an outbreak. So how do we depopulate? How do we clean and disinfect these barns? How do we indemnify these farmers? They have relationships with the USDA, not as much the CDC, so they know these folks. The problem is that the USDA and state departments of agriculture are not putting enough into the front end of it, where we know that prevention is pennies on the dollar. I think there is absolutely potential to utilize and innovate and think more about how to reduce risk on the front end. We just haven’t had the kind of leadership in that area to really focus on some of these new approaches that probably are going to ultimately have some value. We’re using the same kind of playbook that we’ve used for decades on how to prevent outbreaks. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.Ultimately, we probably need to dedicate more resources on the front end, and I think that’s where the farmers need help. I think we know that, but we just haven’t had that push toward innovation, technology and some of the newer ways we can prevent, understand, risk and triage. And then make decisions that are more science-based instead of saying all farmers need better biosecurity, because we’ve tried that and it’s really not working. Healio: Do people with backyard chickens — whether they are pets, laying eggs or will be used as broilers — need to worry about bird flu either for their birds or for themselves? Pitesky: The higher risk for backyard chickens is still boring old Salmonella, Campylobacter and similar types of bacteria that we can contract through contact with these birds.But we obviously have dairy workers who were infected, so we have demonstrated that the virus can jump from birds to mammals, including humans. My recommendation for anyone who has backyard animals is the same as it was before this outbreak: Be really cautious about contact, washing your hands and not touching your mouth or eyes or anything like that. Kids obviously are a little more likely to do these things. We just need to be real cautious. Anyone who is at risk or can’t exhibit those good practices probably shouldn’t have backyard livestock around. Healio: What should clinicians take away from the ongoing bird flu outbreak in terms of caring for patients? Pitesky: Poultry, right now, is the number one consumed animal protein on the planet, so I look at this from a security perspective more than I look at it from a public health perspective. The reality is humans have domesticated animals for about 7,000 years or so, not including dogs, and what we’re dealing with geographically — viruses on six continents — and species-wise is unprecedented in the history of agriculture. We’ve never had anything that’s this large before in every facet of an animal disease outbreak.We need to be very careful. We need to put a lot of energy into trying to prevent this from getting any worse because it doesn’t seem to be going away, and I wouldn’t anticipate it going away at this point. We’re finding it in wastewater; we’re finding it in domesticated livestock, such dairy cows and chickens; and in all kinds of wildlife in places that we’ve never seen it before. So, it’s hard to imagine that it’s going away any time soon.References:CDC.

In a letter to USDA, the delegation cited the recent and unprecedented spread of the virus to dairy cattle as a sign that significant and immediate action is needed. The lawmakers pointed out that Iowa is the first state to proactively implement biosecurity protocols and testing measures for infected dairy farms, but noted that additional resources from the USDA are necessary to support impacted farmers, reinforce state response measures, and provide backing for disease research. “Preventing and mitigating animal disease is a team effort,” Ernst said. “The livelihoods of our farmers, the stability of our local economies, and the broader food supply chain are all on the line, so we must have all hands on deck in the fight against avian flu. I’m working hard to ensure our producers and state leaders have the tools they need to stop the spread, and I urge the USDA to join me in making it a top priority.” “An effective response to Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza and other foreign animal diseases requires maximum cooperation between federal, state, and local agencies as well as industry partners. As we’ve battled Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza over the past three years, including now both in poultry and dairy, our joint federal and state response team has benefited greatly from this collaborative approach and the shared expertise that exists throughout this partnership. This disease threat is of importance to all of agriculture and as this situation evolves, we must continue to harness the full capacity and resources of the relevant federal agencies to confront any new challenge. I remain appreciative of the advocacy of Iowa’s federal delegation who are committed to protecting and growing Iowa agriculture, our state’s biggest and most important industry,” said Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig. “Iowa’s turkey farmers need all the tools they can to protect their flocks and strengthen their response to H5N1,” said Gretta Irwin, Executive Director of the Iowa Turkey Federation. “We are grateful for the wildlife personnel working with Iowa farmers to mitigate interaction of wild birds with domestic turkeys. We applaud the ongoing epidemiological analysis and research of the outbreak. This on the farm work is critical in understanding the virus so farmers can make changes to hopefully prevent future outbreaks. To help protect the health of our turkeys, we encourage the swift approval of vaccines for all species.” “Iowa State Dairy Association (ISDA) appreciates Senator Ernst’s vigilance as dairy farmers navigate the challenges posed by highly pathogenic avian influenza and its impact on dairy cattle,” said Mariah Busta, Executive Director of the Iowa State Dairy Association. “There is a need for increased disease research and response efforts to support the state’s dairy industry. ISDA values the Senator’s advocacy for Iowa dairy farmers and the broader agriculture community.” “North Central Poultry Association appreciates Senator Ernst for continuing to work on behalf of poultry and egg farmers,” said Kevin Stiles, executive director of the North Central Poultry Association and the Iowa Egg Council. “Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) continues to have an extensive impact on the entire poultry and egg producer community. While federal and state officials have been working alongside farmers for years to contain and stop HPAI, as the disease evolves, our management approach must evolve too. We believe new research, updated formulas for assistance, and open lines of communication will help curb the spread.” Background: Ernst has long been a champion of foreign animal disease prevention and preparedness efforts including her work to support the Beagle Brigade and the bipartisan Animal Disease and Disaster Prevention, Surveillance, and Rapid Response Act. Following the most recent HPAI outbreaks in northwest Iowa in both poultry flocks and dairy herds, she is working to hold federal agencies accountable to providing public and state agencies with coordinated, up-to-date, and accurate information on the spread of HPAI. ### Print Email Share Tweet Previous Next About Assistance For Iowans Priorities News Contact Privacy Policy Senator Ernst Facebook Senator Ernst Twitter Senator Ernst Instagram Senator Ernst Youtube About Assistance for Iowans Casework Traveling Office Hours Visiting Washington, D.C.

(All-American Dairy Show)MADISON, Wis. — The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCP) is requiring Influenza A testing prior to movement of lactating dairy cattle to fairs or exhibitions became effective on June 19, 2024. This goal of this state orderis to prevent the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) (H5N1) in dairy cattle. While this effort seeks to limit the spread of the disease, further prevention efforts are advised as there is risk of disease transmission anytime animals are commingled. DATCP continues to update the frequently asked questions document on the state order. Access the FAQ here. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) has now confirmed the presence of HPAI (H5N1) in more than 120 dairy herds in 12 states including Iowa, Michigan, and Minnesota. Access the full list of H5N1 detections in livestock. To date, there have not been any detections of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) (H5N1) in Wisconsin cattle, poultry, or wildlife with the genotype associated with dairy cattle detections in other states. Producers should continue to enhance their biosecurity efforts and monitor and control disease in their herds and flocks. DATCP is closely monitoring HPAI (H5N1) in dairy cattle and continues to encourage producers that notice unusual clinical signs in their cattle to work with their herd veterinarian. To report herds with unexplained symptoms, veterinarians should contact DATCP at (608) 224-4872 (business hours) or (800) 943-0003 (after hours and weekends).

Back to Healio Key takeaways:Bird flu has affected more than 97 million birds and 131 dairy herds in the U.S.The usefulness of vaccinating birds and cows remains under debate.Avian influenza continues to be detected among birds and dairy cows in the United States, raising questions about how to control the more than 2-year-old outbreak.According to the CDC, highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) — also called bird flu — has affected more than 97 million wild aquatic birds, commercial poultry and backyard flocks since January 2022, with more than 1,150 outbreaks in 526 counties across all 50 states. H5N1 has also been detected in 131 dairy herds in 12 states. Four people in the U.S. have been infected with H5N1, including three this year — all of whom were exposed to infected dairy cows, according to the CDC.We reached out to Maurice Pitesky, DVM, MPVM, BMEA, a faculty member at the University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine-Cooperative Extension, to answer some of our lingering questions about H5N1, including whether it is possible to control the outbreak by vaccinating birds and cows. The answers have been lightly edited for clarity and length. Healio: Are there vaccines to prevent H5N1 spread in bird flocks and cow herds? Pitesky: Yes. The Chinese use them. The French are starting to explore them. We know from our COVID experience that vaccines are not a panacea, and there are scientific challenges. There are economic and political challenges. Scientifically, the big issue is that, just like with COVID-19, the vaccines protect against disease but don't protect against infection. The worry is that you could have asymptomatic spread of the virus, and that can be dangerous. One of the nice things about clinical signs is that you know there’s an infection. We need to do necropsies on these birds to determine what's wrong with them because once we know that there's a problem, then we can really work on euthanasia, quarantine, the type of interventions that ultimately help prevent the spread of the virus. Those are the scientific and logistical or infrastructural-type issues. On the political side, countries that vaccinate historically aren't allowed to trade internationally. The United States is a huge exporter of poultry products, mainly on the chicken broiler side. There are economic and political considerations there that are still kind of challenging. This outbreak is so significant that the powers that be are reconsidering that kind of generic policy. I don't think we've really finalized the minutiae on that but there definitely is some movement in that direction.Also, the vaccines are good, but they're not perfect. The French have used them in ducks, for example, to some success and some failure. The question is: If you vaccinate, and you vaccinate again, and you still get clinical signs, what are you ultimately doing? What did you accomplish by vaccinating those birds if they eventually get infected with the virus? Healio: Is it reasonable or possible to vaccinate entire flocks or herds? Pitesky: Vaccination is easy; immunization is hard. Giving a vaccine in drinking water for 10,000 birds — or 1 million birds, even — is not easy, per se, but we do that a lot in the poultry industry.Immunization is a little hard. We process 8 billion broiler chickens a year. There’s no way, logistically, that you can give them the two required doses. The logistics and economics of that is very challenging. When you’re dealing with that many broiler, that’s not trivial, and that’s expensive. And now companies and consumers ultimately are going to pay the price for that.[For birds that lay eggs], there might be a little more of a push to do that because layer birds, they’re not producing eggs for about 20 weeks or so. There’s much more value that you would ultimately get in protecting those birds vs. a broiler chicken, as opposed to vaccinating maybe 50 or 60 days before it’s ultimately processed.In my mind, and my bias with the work that I do, you really want to triage where you’re going to vaccinate and you want to understand where the risk is greatest. The main reservoir of the virus are wild waterfowl, like ducks and geese. You ultimately want to identify which locations are historically — and are forecasted to be — in the crosshairs of waterfowl habitat relative to these commercial poultry facilities. Then, companies can make a more nuanced decision about where they want to focus their vaccination resources. Healio: Are farmers willing, or would they be willing, to participate in a large-scale national vaccination program, or even just disease surveillance? Pitesky: Right now we’re dealing with something unprecedented, and farmers need help. Right now, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is helping with all of their resources, money and labor on what happens after an outbreak. So how do we depopulate? How do we clean and disinfect these barns? How do we indemnify these farmers? They have relationships with the USDA, not as much the CDC, so they know these folks. The problem is that the USDA and state departments of agriculture are not putting enough into the front end of it, where we know that prevention is pennies on the dollar. I think there is absolutely potential to utilize and innovate and think more about how to reduce risk on the front end. We just haven’t had the kind of leadership in that area to really focus on some of these new approaches that probably are going to ultimately have some value. We’re using the same kind of playbook that we’ve used for decades on how to prevent outbreaks. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.Ultimately, we probably need to dedicate more resources on the front end, and I think that’s where the farmers need help. I think we know that, but we just haven’t had that push toward innovation, technology and some of the newer ways we can prevent, understand, risk and triage. And then make decisions that are more science-based instead of saying all farmers need better biosecurity, because we’ve tried that and it’s really not working. Healio: Do people with backyard chickens — whether they are pets, laying eggs or will be used as broilers — need to worry about bird flu either for their birds or for themselves? Pitesky: The higher risk for backyard chickens is still boring old Salmonella, Campylobacter and similar types of bacteria that we can contract through contact with these birds.But we obviously have dairy workers who were infected, so we have demonstrated that the virus can jump from birds to mammals, including humans. My recommendation for anyone who has backyard animals is the same as it was before this outbreak: Be really cautious about contact, washing your hands and not touching your mouth or eyes or anything like that. Kids obviously are a little more likely to do these things. We just need to be real cautious. Anyone who is at risk or can’t exhibit those good practices probably shouldn’t have backyard livestock around. Healio: What should clinicians take away from the ongoing bird flu outbreak in terms of caring for patients? Pitesky: Poultry, right now, is the number one consumed animal protein on the planet, so I look at this from a security perspective more than I look at it from a public health perspective. The reality is humans have domesticated animals for about 7,000 years or so, not including dogs, and what we’re dealing with geographically — viruses on six continents — and species-wise is unprecedented in the history of agriculture. We’ve never had anything that’s this large before in every facet of an animal disease outbreak.We need to be very careful. We need to put a lot of energy into trying to prevent this from getting any worse because it doesn’t seem to be going away, and I wouldn’t anticipate it going away at this point. We’re finding it in wastewater; we’re finding it in domesticated livestock, such dairy cows and chickens; and in all kinds of wildlife in places that we’ve never seen it before. So, it’s hard to imagine that it’s going away any time soon.References:CDC.

The country still does not have a sufficient testing infrastructure in place, nor a full understanding of how the virus is moving within herds and to new herds, experts say. Government officials also have not secured the cooperation from farmers and dairy workers that would be required to rein in the outbreak.advertisement The U.S. Department of Agriculture has stated that its goal is to eliminate the virus, known as H5N1, from cattle. But that messaging has left scientists scratching their heads about how exactly officials plan to stop further transmission given that the impediments persist. It’s also not clear whether the virus could burn out, or if cows are vulnerable to reinfection. “If that was the goal, we should have been doing a lot of other things from the beginning,” said Seema Lakdawala, an influenza expert at Emory University. “We could have been working toward that for the last three months, rather than trying to play catch-up now.” Other countries are taking notice. Last month, a committee of scientific advisers alerted the French government to the “unprecedented situation” happening 4,000 miles away, saying that while the start of the virus’s spread among cows had not yet increased the threat to people, it was concerning enough that the government needed to take its own measures. “The situation is serious,” Bruno Lina, a virologist and member of the committee, told STAT, noting that European countries were already expanding their surveillance systems to include cows. “It has to be taken seriously in the U.S., and that is what we expect from the U.S.”advertisement But by just about all accounts, not enough is being done. USDA maintained that its scientists, veterinarians, and animal health experts “have been working at all hours, day in and day out” to respond to the virus. The agency also said as it continues to increase outreach to raise awareness of the programs USDA has started, the agency expects testing to increase in the weeks ahead. “The actions we have taken to limit movements, improve biosecurity and encourage testing are expected to establish the foundation for eliminating this virus from the dairy herd,” the agency said in a written statement provided to STAT. The USDA said the agency is “taking animal health and human health concerns seriously through a whole-of-government response.” Agency officials first announced the virus had infected dairy herds on March 25, though it’s perhaps been seven months since the outbreak actually started. Further readingGo deeper: H5N1 bird flu Here are the bird flu questions top scientists would like to see answered. Michigan is doing more bird flu testing than any other state. Will others follow? Producing a H5N1 vaccine is more complicated than you might think. And the world would need a lot of it. And finally, an important avian flu precaution: Don't drink raw milk. To gauge the risk of the situation and assess the response, STAT spoke with a range of experts both in the U.S. and internationally. What emerges is a portrait of a threat that is steadily rolling along, yet also settling into what feels like a routine. Nearly every day, a few new herds are found to have infections, entrenching the virus deeper into the cattle population and expanding its footprint across more states. As of Wednesday, 129 herds in 12 states have reported infections, although those figures are widely assumed to be underestimates because many farmers are refusing to test. Three farmworkers, in Texas and Michigan, are known to have developed mild cases of H5N1, presumably from close contact with cows. But if the dynamics of the outbreak haven’t changed, neither, experts say, has the forcefulness of the response. While the situation presents both scientific and logistical challenges, a chief concern is that neither the government nor outside scientists know just how far and wide the virus has spread because critical data have either not been collected or transparently relayed. The government still does not have an adequate surveillance system in place to keep up with the outbreak, scientists say. Agricultural authorities are still releasing only partial data from the genetic sequences of the viruses they’ve sampled. There is not widespread testing of cows or of workers on dairy farms, leading to fears of missed infections, both bovine and human. Broad serology studies of either cows or people — which could detect antibodies to H5N1 in blood and provide an estimate of the true scope of infections — have yet to release results, though at least one is underway in Michigan. These are all complaints that experts have been lodging for weeks, if not longer. The failure to address them, they say, is hamstringing efforts to track the virus, to contain its spread in cattle, and to see if it’s adapting in ways that could make it more likely to jump to people. “If you still can’t determine the scale of the outbreak, and which states, what farms, what herds, are actually being affected, I don’t see how you can possibly think that it’s containable,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan. USDA said that the agency provided sequencing data immediately to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and has made information publicly available. The agency also said it has sent epidemiological strike teams to Michigan and Iowa at the states’ requests. Even if the outbreak seems to be following a pattern, that might not always be the case. Scientists note that H5N1 bird flu has forced regular rewrites to flu dogma since it emerged as a risk to people nearly three decades ago. “It doesn’t appear that the overall animal outbreak is changing in character, as of yet, but it’s difficult to know because we have so little data,” said Tom Inglesby, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, who, like several experts, argued that if this outbreak were playing out in another country, U.S. officials would be calling the response unacceptable. Three H5N1 bird flu virus particles. The strain emerged as a risk to people nearly three decades ago, but a newer clade seems to have heightened the threat. CDC and NIAID Limited measures, reluctant farmers Over the past few months, authorities have rolled out a number of interventions, trying, for example, to bolster protections for dairy workers and incentivize farms to expand surveillance. They’ve put up some money for farms to improve biosecurity measures and widen testing, though only a fraction of farms, including those with infected herds, have taken the government up on its offer. States are trying to give away personal protective equipment that could be worn in milking parlors, but again, few farms have expressed interest. Within a month of the identification of the outbreak, federal authorities started requiring testing of lactating dairy cows, though only when they crossed state lines, and even then, only a limited number per shipment, chosen by the farmer. Agencies are trying to widen their approach. The CDC has started publicly tracking influenza A viruses — the family to which H5N1 belongs — in wastewater samples. And states are taking their own steps beyond quarantining infected herds. In Iowa, for example, agricultural authorities have started requiring testing of dairy cows around infected poultry flocks. Several states are requiring lactating cows to be tested for flu before they can be brought to fairs. But the government’s own data indicate the efforts have holes large enough for the virus to run through. In one USDA survey, 60% of farms acknowledged moving cows within a state even after the animals had started showing symptoms of infection. Federal officials have acknowledged they’re not getting much cooperation from dairy producers and workers. “The more we learn about H5N1, the more we understand that good biosecurity is a critically important path to containing the virus,” Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack wrote last week in an op-ed in the media outlet Agri-Pulse, calling on farmers to step up the use of PPE, limit traffic onto their farms, and increase cleaning and disinfection practices in their barns and milking parlors. “It’s not [being] managed as a zoonotic disease that is a potential dynamic threat. It may well not become a pandemic. But I think it’s playing with fire.” Marion Koopmans, chief of viroscience at Erasmus Medical Center H5N1 has been on scientists’ radars as a threat since the late 1990s, and over the years, it has managed to spill from wild birds into different mammalian species, causing infections that seemed more like one-offs. But an H5N1 strain that emerged a few years ago seemed to change the game. It has been carried by migratory birds to just about every corner of the world, decimating poultry flocks along the way and infecting more and more mammals. This version of the virus is the one that is transmitting among dairy cows. The ongoing spread among cows raises particular concerns, not limited to the economic toll the virus could take on farmers by depleting cows’ milk or by preventing them from selling product. As the virus has spread, so too have fears that it could become an endemic pathogen in a species that has considerable contact with people, creating a lasting risk to dairy workers. Underlying it all is the grave concern that the virus could one day evolve in ways that make it better at spreading to and among people. The virus is not there yet, and scientists say it would likely need to change in a number of ways for that to happen. But they believe the nature of the current spread could conceivably lay the groundwork for the next pandemic. Historically, the virus has had an alarmingly high fatality rate when it has caused human infections, though all three documented human cases that have emerged from the cattle outbreak have been mild. “It’s not [being] managed as a zoonotic disease that is a potential dynamic threat,” said Marion Koopmans, chief of viroscience at Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands. “It may well not become a pandemic. But I think it’s playing with fire.” H5N1 bird flu seems to move quite efficiently from cow to cow, though likely with human help, via milking equipment. Robert F. Bukaty/AP Familiar hurdles In some ways, experts say, the bird flu outbreak is exposing the same systemic obstacles that hobbled the U.S. performance during the Covid-19 pandemic. The response is falling on various local, state, and federal agencies with limited authorities and disparate, sometimes competing, agendas. In this case, it’s a balkanization compounded by the need for public health officials to collaborate with agricultural agencies, which are often tilted to supporting industry instead of prioritizing reining in threats to human health. State agricultural agencies are also underfunded and understaffed; meanwhile, some portion of the public is resistant to measures to track and control the virus. “There seems to be a lot of issues between the agencies, the federal government, the states, the farmers,” said Florian Krammer, a flu virologist at Mount Sinai’s Icahn School of Medicine in New York. “It’s not looking like everybody’s on the same side trying to get rid of the problem.” Many scientists acknowledge the tightrope that government officials are treading. Fearful of overstepping, agencies are reluctant to use the full extent of their legal authority to demand testing on farms — something that could lead to a political backlash in an election year. Such a response would be perhaps all the more likely in a post-Covid pandemic world, and would impede whatever receptiveness farmers are showing. Beyond the mistrust of government agencies some farmers harbor, dairy producers, working with slim margins to begin with, have real economic concerns. If they report an infected herd, they can’t sell milk or move cattle, which are frequently transported for breeding and grazing. Veterinarians who have been working with farmers told STAT that while some infected herds have been cleared to return to milk production, farmers still fear what a positive test means for them. Given the risks, it’s easier not to test. “Even though I’m disappointed by some of the things the federal government is doing, I understand the constraints they’re working under,” said Andrew Pavia, the chief of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Utah, who also works on public health preparedness. “And even though I’m disappointed by some of the barriers that farm associations and farmers are throwing up, I understand where they’re coming from. I think we need to work together to figure it out.” Related: USDA, FDA turf battles hamper responses to outbreaks like H5N1 bird flu Thorny challenges stand in the way of looking for human cases as well. Private farms might not give public health agencies access, and even if they do, dairy workers might dodge testing. A positive test could mean missing work and lost income. Many farmworkers do not speak English, and may not have health insurance. A portion are presumed to be in the country illegally, aspects that discourage cooperation with health investigations. Public health officials have made clear they’ve run into these problems. A study of the first human case tied to the outbreak — a Texas dairy worker who developed conjunctivitis — reported that the man and his contacts refused to have their blood drawn for serology tests, which could have shown whether others were infected. As of mid-June, just over 50 people had been tested for novel influenza strains, which would include H5N1, according to the CDC’s most recent figures. “Do they get time off when they’re sick? If not, will they be willing to come forward to declare themselves feeling ill?” Laszlo Madaras, the chief medical officer of the Migrant Clinicians Network, said during a webinar last week for rural providers, whom he stressed could be trusted sources of information for dairy workers. Aerial view of the Sunrise Farms processing plant in Petaluma, Calif. There is not widespread testing of cows or of workers on dairy farms, leading to fears of missed infections, both bovine and human. Terry Chea/AP Possible ways forward Such dynamics give rise to the question of what an effective response should look like — one that coaxes greater participation from farms, improves surveillance, and fits with what agencies are empowered to do. Several experts said state and federal agencies, as well as rural doctors and veterinarians, need to conduct education campaigns, both to outline steps that dairy workers can take to prevent infections, and to explain to farmers how being transparent can help protect herds and the safety of the milk supply. Whatever steps are being proposed, they said, producers have to get on board if they’re to succeed. “Unless you’ve got 80% of the industry in a position to support you, you don’t have the manpower, or the dollars, to dictate what you’re going to do,” said John Korslund, who worked as a USDA veterinarian for two decades. “So it’s very much a cooperative effort. And if you’re not in a position where you can get cooperation from the industry with what you’re proposing to do, you can’t do it.” USDA said the agency is working with the food and agriculture sector and “hand in glove” with state health officials to raise awareness about available resources. The agency has been hosting regular meetings to share updates and hear concerns, a spokesperson said. The trust gap with farmers has continued even though some federal officials are well-connected to the dairy industry. Vilsack, for example, used to be a top-paid executive at Dairy Management, a trade association that promotes milk and dairy products. “He’s shown time and again that he’s on the side of farmers, and, you know, particularly dairy farmers, right?” said Brian Ronholm, Consumer Reports’ director of food policy and a former USDA food safety official. “So if anyone can kind of reach that divide, it is someone like him.” Other ideas that experts called for included bulk testing of milk, which could narrow geographically where new outbreaks are occurring. So far, that is only being done voluntarily, by a tiny number of farms. Many said there needs to be testing of asymptomatic cows, as well as those showing signs of illness. Some scientists are arguing for vaccinating cows, though that is still a point of debate. A USDA spokesperson said that the bulk milk testing is in its “initial pilot phase” and that six states are enrolled as of Tuesday: Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Texas, Ohio, and North Carolina. The agency is conducting outreach to provide more information about the program, the spokesperson said. Some experts pointed to measures other countries are taking — even though no other country has documented a cattle infection — as steps that could help the U.S. get ahead of the virus. “There seems to be a lot of issues between the agencies, the federal government, the states, the farmers. It’s not looking like everybody’s on the same side trying to get rid of the problem.” Florian Krammer, flu virologist Thijs Kuiken, a pathologist at Erasmus Medical Center, noted that Canada has made it mandatory to report suspected H5N1 cases in cows; in the U.S., only positive tests have to be reported to federal authorities. (Some states have also said suspected cases need to be reported.) Researchers in Germany have made public early results from serology studies in cows. It’s also a matter of money, many experts said. The government might simply need to pony up more resources both as a way to get access to farms for testing and to cover farmers’ losses if they have an infected herd and can’t sell milk. Experts noted that the government pays poultry farmers for birds that need to be culled to contain H5N1 outbreaks in domestic flocks. A program to cover some portion of lost milk production has been announced, but authorities are still ironing out the details. The program will be retroactive to the date herds were confirmed positive, the USDA said. “USDA anticipates that its forthcoming rule will specify that farmers will receive payments at 90 percent of lost production per cow,” an agency spokesperson said. Ultimately, though, there are constraints on the incentives agencies can offer. The Biden administration isn’t likely to get any additional funding from a Congress split between Democrats and Republicans. Multiple senators said in brief interviews with STAT that administration officials haven’t asked for more resources. John Auerbach, a former CDC official during the Obama and Biden administrations who is now a public health consultant at the firm ICF, said the administration’s reticence to ask for more money is not surprising, given the difficulty that Congress has had simply keeping the government open. “I understand why the Democrats would be reluctant to open that can of worms up again,” Auerbach said. The USDA reiterated that the agency has approved a transfer of $824 million from a separate funding stream to support response efforts. The secretary of agriculture can authorize additional funding to address emergency outbreaks, like a previous $1.3 billion tranche approved to increase detection of avian influenza in wild birds and poultry. The repeated use of milking equipment from cow to cow seems to be a key route of H5N1 transmission. ARIANA DREHSLER/AFP via Getty Images A unified approach Fundamentally, experts said, the U.S. needs a more coordinated response instead of the piecemeal approach it’s seen so far. “It only takes one state to be doing a really bad job or to be covering up or something for it to then be getting into further states, and the outbreak carries on,” said Thomas Peacock, an influenza virologist at the Pirbright Institute, a British organization that focuses on controlling viral illnesses in animals. For all the political and economic challenges, scientists have plenty of questions to answer as well. For one, there is still not a comprehensive understanding of the way, or ways, the virus is spreading. The repeated use of milking equipment from cow to cow seems to be a key route, but scientists think there have to be other, undiscovered viral pathways that haven’t been specified beyond the movement of equipment, cows, and people from farm to farm. The scientific specifics of this outbreak are also complicating the response. Many of the world’s top flu scientists have acknowledged they didn’t think cows could get H5N1, a blind spot that delayed pinpointing the virus as the culprit behind a decline in milk production among cows in the Texas Panhandle. And while other mammals, with a few exceptions, haven’t spread H5N1 to others of their species, it seems the virus is moving quite efficiently from cow to cow, though likely with human help, via milking equipment. The challenges go on. Cows, generally, aren’t getting that sick. The three related human cases have all been mild. It’s easy for those types of incidents to be ignored or missed, giving the virus a chance to spread silently. Related: Getting farmworkers to use PPE is hard, but it’s the best way to stop an H5N1 bird flu epidemic Scientists credited the government with policy changes that haven’t earned many headlines but that they say are helpful. A tweak in how the USDA classifies H5N1 has allowed additional researchers to study the virus, Emory’s Lakdawala said. (They still need a USDA permit and must conduct the work in a high-containment lab.) More scientists are now trying to crack open some of the basics of the virus — how it spreads, how it’s evolving, the quality and durability of immunity — and it’s made it more feasible to do wastewater monitoring for the virus. The CDC is also flagging to health care providers the possibility of human cases. The agency has encouraged clinicians to test people for flu even though in the summer the usual human flu strains transmit at very low levels. “It’s really important when you’re seeing a patient that might have acute respiratory illness or conjunctivitis, whether or not they have a fever, even if they appear to have clinically mild illness, you should ask them what they do,” Tim Uyeki, the chief medical officer of the CDC’s influenza division, said on the webinar for rural clinicians. “What kind of work do they do? Do they have potential occupational exposure to an infected animal?” To some scientists, the situation on dairy farms is not some new threat, but rather an extension of one that’s been building as H5N1 has swept around the world. While the outbreak stoked particular concerns — such as cows’ close contact with people, and the risk to the milk supply — they argued that the latest event has only highlighted how important it is for the world to give more attention to the virus broadly. “Arguably, the global spread of this virus over the last four years — the fact that it has been jumping from species to species quite happily — to me, that already felt like a big enough call to arms,” said Colin Russell, an evolutionary biologist at Amsterdam University Medical Center and chair of a European network of influenza experts. “We have to be very careful in the presentation of this, not as, ‘Oh it’s in cattle, now there’s going to be a pandemic,’ but more that this is just a further illustration of the potential of this virus and the fact that we need to be taking the whole H5 situation seriously, globally,” he said.

In a letter to USDA, the delegation cited the recent and unprecedented spread of the virus to dairy cattle as a sign that significant and immediate action is needed. The lawmakers pointed out that Iowa is the first state to proactively implement biosecurity protocols and testing measures for infected dairy farms, but noted that additional resources from the USDA are necessary to support impacted farmers, reinforce state response measures, and provide backing for disease research. “Preventing and mitigating animal disease is a team effort,” Ernst said. “The livelihoods of our farmers, the stability of our local economies, and the broader food supply chain are all on the line, so we must have all hands on deck in the fight against avian flu. I’m working hard to ensure our producers and state leaders have the tools they need to stop the spread, and I urge the USDA to join me in making it a top priority.” “An effective response to Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza and other foreign animal diseases requires maximum cooperation between federal, state, and local agencies as well as industry partners. As we’ve battled Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza over the past three years, including now both in poultry and dairy, our joint federal and state response team has benefited greatly from this collaborative approach and the shared expertise that exists throughout this partnership. This disease threat is of importance to all of agriculture and as this situation evolves, we must continue to harness the full capacity and resources of the relevant federal agencies to confront any new challenge. I remain appreciative of the advocacy of Iowa’s federal delegation who are committed to protecting and growing Iowa agriculture, our state’s biggest and most important industry,” said Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig. “Iowa’s turkey farmers need all the tools they can to protect their flocks and strengthen their response to H5N1,” said Gretta Irwin, Executive Director of the Iowa Turkey Federation. “We are grateful for the wildlife personnel working with Iowa farmers to mitigate interaction of wild birds with domestic turkeys. We applaud the ongoing epidemiological analysis and research of the outbreak. This on the farm work is critical in understanding the virus so farmers can make changes to hopefully prevent future outbreaks. To help protect the health of our turkeys, we encourage the swift approval of vaccines for all species.” “Iowa State Dairy Association (ISDA) appreciates Senator Ernst’s vigilance as dairy farmers navigate the challenges posed by highly pathogenic avian influenza and its impact on dairy cattle,” said Mariah Busta, Executive Director of the Iowa State Dairy Association. “There is a need for increased disease research and response efforts to support the state’s dairy industry. ISDA values the Senator’s advocacy for Iowa dairy farmers and the broader agriculture community.” “North Central Poultry Association appreciates Senator Ernst for continuing to work on behalf of poultry and egg farmers,” said Kevin Stiles, executive director of the North Central Poultry Association and the Iowa Egg Council. “Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) continues to have an extensive impact on the entire poultry and egg producer community. While federal and state officials have been working alongside farmers for years to contain and stop HPAI, as the disease evolves, our management approach must evolve too. We believe new research, updated formulas for assistance, and open lines of communication will help curb the spread.” Background: Ernst has long been a champion of foreign animal disease prevention and preparedness efforts including her work to support the Beagle Brigade and the bipartisan Animal Disease and Disaster Prevention, Surveillance, and Rapid Response Act. Following the most recent HPAI outbreaks in northwest Iowa in both poultry flocks and dairy herds, she is working to hold federal agencies accountable to providing public and state agencies with coordinated, up-to-date, and accurate information on the spread of HPAI. ### Print Email Share Tweet Previous Next About Assistance For Iowans Priorities News Contact Privacy Policy Senator Ernst Facebook Senator Ernst Twitter Senator Ernst Instagram Senator Ernst Youtube About Assistance for Iowans Casework Traveling Office Hours Visiting Washington, D.C.

She is the author of Runaway Medicine: What You Don’t Know May Kill You, and the cofounder of the California-based homeless work program Wheels of Change.Traces of bird flu have been found in store-bought milk. To date, the CDC has documented three human cases associated with an ongoing multistate outbreak of H5N1 in U.S. dairy cows.David L. Ryan - The Boston Globe - Getty ImagesThe latest iteration of bird flu is concerning enough in its own right. It has already demonstrated a tremendous ability to jump species, and its spread to farm livestock has raised alarms among researchers studying the possibility of mass infection—including in humans. What’s even more worrisome in the U.S., though, is what happens next. Assuming the H5N1 outbreak eventually reaches far more people than the three who’ve been confirmed so far in connection with dairy cows, how prepared are government agencies to react to widespread infection or a pandemic? Increasingly, experts fear, the answer to that question is a grim one. “Our antiviral supply for influenza is inadequate,” says Rick Bright, immunologist and former director of the Biomedical Advanced R&D Authority. “We need to diversify it—and even that is not enough, with what we have approved (to treat flu). We need to be developing additional treatment options.” An inadequate national stockpile The issues are multifold. The antiviral that the U.S. has in the greatest supply, Tamiflu, has been questioned not only for its path to government approval (virtually all of its clinical trials were drug-company sponsored), but also for its ability to reduce the risk of hospitalization or serious complications of flu. Yet sources told me federal officials in 2018 reportedly ignored pleas for greater diversity in their antiviral stock, instead pushing forward with another Tamiflu order. The U.S. government has also approved an extended shelf life for the drug that is twice what the manufacturer ever requested. Another drug, Baloxavir, has shown promise in preventing the spread of flu. However, the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) includes only hundreds of thousands of doses of that drug, and the process of building up the stockpile is estimated to take 18 to 24 months. And experts say that whichever country puts money on the table first often gets first access to supply, so it’s important to get in line. Viral resistance can develop rather quickly to either drug, highlighting the need for other treatment options.“Given how frequently flu viruses change and the potential for flu viruses to develop resistance or reduced susceptibility to one or more flu antiviral drugs, it is good to have more options for treating flu,” the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says. In response to information obtained by the author of this article and viewed by Fortune that has not previously been made public by the CDC, a spokesperson confirmed that oseltamivir (generic for Tamiflu) showed a 16-fold reduction in its ability to inhibit the H5N1 virus collected from an infected dairy worker in Texas, when compared to the activity against a seasonal virus. That reduction is considered minor, the spokesperson said, and the CDC continues to recommend “prompt antiviral treatment with oseltamivir for patients with confirmed or suspected H5N1 virus infection.” That finding, though, confounded experts. “While (the reduction doesn’t mean the Texas virus will be fully resistant to Tamiflu, it is a clear indication that the virus has reduced susceptibility,” says Bright. “Most likely it would take a higher treatment dose or a longer duration of treatment with Tamiflu to be able to treat someone with this H5N1 virus, but more testing is needed…At this point, we cannot rest comfortably that what we have in the stockpile will be sufficient or even adequately effective against H5N1 viruses in people.” (A CDC study did find that the virus was sensitive to some of the other anti-viral drugs tested, including Baloxavir.) “Ideally, you would have a multi-drug cocktail like we have for HIV, for instance,” says Andy Pekosz, influenza researcher and director of the Center for Emerging Viruses and Infectious Diseases at Johns Hopkins University. “With one individual drug, you have a very limited time before the virus gets resistant. But if you put together two or three of them, you build the wall incredibly high for the virus to actually gain resistance against all of those antivirals.” Tamiflu has a shelf life of 10 years, as established by its manufacturer (Roche, now merged with Genentech) and as mandated by the European Union. But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has some stock that dates to 2004, and the FDA has extended the shelf life of some of the oldest purchased Tamiflu products to 20 years for emergency responses–a decision that prompted a Genentech spokesperson to distance the company from it. “If local governments decide to extend the shelf life of the product, that is based on their own assessment and in accordance with government shelf-life extension programs,” the Genentech spokesperson told me. “We do, however, share the concern of public health experts about the perennial threat of pandemic influenza, which could be exacerbated by expiring antivirals in the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile.” No ‘miracle drugs’ Even if Tamiflu worked well, the approximately 55 million treatment courses the U.S. has on hand would be inadequate to treat large-scale human H5N1 infection, especially if it was used preventatively for close contacts, as the CDC currently recommends. “I don’t think there is good data right now that supports its use prophylactically,” says Francesca Torriani, medical director of infection prevention and clinical epidemiology at UC San Diego Health. “In my experience as an infectious disease physician, that is a recipe to basically develop resistance.” “Antiviral drugs are not miracle drugs,” says William Schaffner, a former medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. “The trick is to get in early, try to cut the virus off at the pass—in other words, interfere with the multiplication of that virus before it multiplies too much in our body and evokes a big inflammatory response, Schaffner says. Tamiflu needs to be administered within the first 24 to 48 hours of symptom onset to be effective; a full course includes one pill taken twice daily for five days. Baloxavir, which requires a single dose and works differently than other flu antivirals, has been shown in healthy adult outpatients to have similar efficacy as Tamiflu in time to alleviation of symptoms. It’s a viable alternative in case the virus produces resistance to one drug or the other. But we have nowhere near enough on hand to make a significant difference. How about a human vaccine? Health authorities say we have very limited quantities stockpiled of a 2020 H5 candidate vaccine that could provide some level of immunity against the current, mostly avian virus in cows—useful for those at highest risk of exposure, such as farmworkers. However, the virus would mutate significantly before it becomes the human pandemic strain, experts say, so we’d likely need to rapidly update the vaccine, then mass produce it. Andy Pekosz estimates it would take six to seven months to produce roughly 150 million doses using the traditional method. So it might be two or more years before we’d have enough vaccine to immunize the entire country that way—and we’ll need to manufacture two doses of vaccine for each person. Though mRNA vaccines could be made much faster—“in the order of three months” to generate a significant number of doses, Pekosz says—they aren’t approved yet for influenza by the FDA. Meanwhile, the government is in conversations with Pfizer and Moderna, but anything that gets produced will take time—more time than we would have to respond to a mass outbreak. The U.S. is woefully unprepared for a pandemic All of this might lead one to question the readiness of the U.S. to respond to the next possible pandemic–-in this case, H5N1. That sense of unpreparedness, it turns out, is echoed at the highest levels of government. On 9 May, the powerful House Committee on Energy and Commerce warned of “a pattern of fiscal mismanagement and a series of failed acquisitions that have left the SNS dangerously under-resourced and likely underprepared to respond to future public health emergencies.“ On the same day, a letter to Dawn O’Connell, assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Department of Health and Human Services, laid out the concerns in graphic detail. Writing on behalf of multiple Senate committees and subcommittees, the letter excoriated what it described as “the mismanagement of the Strategic National Stockpile.” The letter, from the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations and viewed by Fortune, noted that the governmental Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) had been placed on a list of agencies that “are vulnerable to waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement, or in need of transformation.” It pointed out that ASPR let more than $850 million in SNS emergency supplemental funding go unused. Those funds were eventually rescinded by the Office of Management and Budget, the letter said, due to “lack of appropriate planning and urgency by ASPR.” We are far below the government’s repeatedly stated goal over five years of 85 million treatment courses of flu antivirals. What is required, Bright says, is to urgently place orders for fresh drugs, refresh long outdated drugs, diversify the SNS holdings to guard against antiviral drug resistance, and accelerate the development of new treatment options. “A head-in-the-sand approach to influenza antiviral readiness will not serve the public well when there is a need to respond to an influenza pandemic,” he says. The time to commence serious action is now, not when the country is staring down the barrel of a full pandemic.

Posted The Humane Society of Tampa Bay (HSTB) is taking drastic measures to protect more than 200 dogs in their care, as well as countless pets within the community, from an aggressive strain of Canine Influenza. For the first time in its 112-year history, the shelter will turn away stray and owner-surrendered dogs in an effort to contain and control the outbreak plaguing shelters across Florida.The Society made this extremely difficult decision after consulting with experts in canine infectious disease, veterinarians, and animal welfare/control leaders in Florida. Hillsborough County Pet Resource Center, Pasco County Animal Services, and Miami Dade Animal Services are also enacting temporary closures to combat the disease.“Our leadership did not make this decision lightly,” said HSTB CEO Sherry Silk, “HSTB prioritizes the health of its animals above all else. Unfortunately, this is an unprecedented situation that calls for extreme and immediate action to protect dogs in Tampa Bay.”The Humane Society of Tampa Bay will take the following measures beginning Wednesday, June 26:No dogs will be accepted into the lost/found, adoption, or foster programs for two weeks.All dogs currently residing at the shelter or in foster care will be tested for canine influenza and be treated accordingly.In an effort to build herd immunity within the community, the HSTB Animal Hospital will provide at-cost ($20) canine influenza vaccinations to owned pets. Owners must make an appointment online at HumaneSocietyTampa.org/ahc [humanesocietytampa.org] or by calling 813-870-3304. The canine influenza vaccination is required twice within two weeks for full protection.HSTB encourages those who find stray dogs to contain and care for them until Saturday, July 13 if possible. The shelter will provide free dog food for citizens caring for strays during this two-week period. Food can be picked up at the shelter between 9am and 5pm Monday through Sunday.HSTB will continue to receive stray and owner-surrendered cats, rabbits, pocket pets, and exotics during this period of dog intake quarantine.Canine Influenza, or dog flu, is an extremely contagious, respiratory disease. Common symptoms include coughing, loss of appetite, fever, nasal discharge, and lethargy. Dog flu is transmitted through the air and with surface contact. It is not transmissible to humans or other animal species, but can be spread to dogs contact with humans or other animals that have the virus present on their fur, skin, or clothing.Most dogs have either mild symptoms, or no symptoms at all, and recover within a few weeks. However, because dogs are not naturally immune to the virus, new strains can cause severe health issues, and sometimes death, in dogs with compromised immune systems.“The community should not panic,” said HSTB Director of Shelter Operations Danyelle Van Horn, “while it should be taken seriously by pet owners, canine influenza is much more dangerous in shelter environments than in private homes because of the sheer number of animals housed together and the multiple avenues of transmission.”The Humane Society of Tampa Bay encourages dog owners to keep their pets up-to-date on all vaccinations and suggests having dogs vaccinated against canine influenza as an added precaution.

Hillsborough County Humane Society, Hillsborough County Pet Resources temporarily refusing new stray dogs over influenza crisis by: Garrett Phillips, Melissa Marino Posted: Jun 25, 2024 / 03:47 PM EDT Updated: Jun 25, 2024 / 04:22 PM EDT by: Garrett Phillips, Melissa Marino Posted: Jun 25, 2024 / 03:47 PM EDT Updated: Jun 25, 2024 / 04:22 PM EDT SHARE TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — The Humane Society of Tampa Bay (HSTB) and Hillsborough County Pet Resources are both making a drastic change to protect dogs in their care. The Hillsborough County Pet Resources will relocate all of the dogs at the center and close for several days this week due to an aggressive strain of canine influenza. Starting Tuesday, staff at the center will move all dogs to another location owned by the county, with most dogs expected to return in mid-July. As for the Humane Society, HSTB is turning away stray and owner-surrendered dogs for the first time in its 112-year history. The Humane Society and Hillsborough County Pet Resources said they came to the decision after consulting experts, veterinarians, and animal welfare leaders in Florida. “Canine influenza is circulating right now within the state. There are some other shelters, besides us, that have been hit and are kind of going through the same thing,” said Scott Trebatoski, Director of the Pet Resource Center. “We tried over the last couple of weeks to try to contain it within the shelter, but it seemed like it was just continuously going even with our containment efforts, so we contacted the University of Florida, Dr. Crawford is the world expert on canine influenza and she told us the only way that we could actually get rid of it was to shut down dog operations. This is the biggest operation we’ve ever had.” Trebatoski said PRC had outbreaks in 2015 and 2018 that they were able to contain. “Right now we’re about 150% capacity so there’s no way to contain it here, so we wanted to go to a site where we could get all the dogs in one location,” he said. Pasco County Animal Services and Miami Dade Animal Services are also enacting temporary closures to combat the disease, HSTB said. “Our leadership did not make this decision lightly,” said HSTB CEO Sherry Silk, “HSTB prioritizes the health of its animals above all else. Unfortunately, this is an unprecedented situation that calls for extreme and immediate action to protect dogs in Tampa Bay.” Beginning Wednesday, June 26, neither the Humane Society nor the Hillsborough County Pet Resource Center will accept dogs into the lost/found, adoption, or foster care programs for a couple of weeks. All dogs currently in the shelter or in foster care will be tested for canine influenza and treated accordingly. The Resource Center will be closed from Wednesday until Monday, July 1, and will not accept new dogs until July 14. The shelter will be cleaned and undergo extensive disinfection. Meanwhile, the Humane Society said it would offer free dog food to citizens who are caring for stray dogs while the shelter is refusing to take in new dogs. Food can be picked up at the shelter from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Sunday. Canine influenza is an extremely contagious respiratory disease. Most dogs have mild or no symptoms, but severe health complications can arise, sometimes leading to death. “Canine influenza is a very contagious virus,” said Dr. Jerika Brooks, Lead Veterinarian at Pet Resource Center. “The symptoms tend to be very similar to kennel cough, you’re going to see obviously some coughing, fevers, some lethargy and just not feeling great. It’s really quite similar to human influenza.” Lab tests confirmed that they were dealing with canine influenza. “The community should not panic,” said HSTB Director of Shelter Operations Danyelle Van Horn, “while it should be taken seriously by pet owners, canine influenza is much more dangerous in shelter environments than in private homes because of the sheer number of animals housed together and the multiple avenues of transmission.” HSTB is also offering at-cost ($20) canine influenza vaccines to pet owners in an attempt to build herd immunity. Owners must make an appointment online at HumaneSocietyTampa.org/ahc or by calling 813-870-3304. The Humane Society will continue to take in stray cats, rabbits, pocket pets, and exotics during this period of dog intake quarantine. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

Pfeiffer is a professor of One Health and veterinary epidemiology. The noble push to achieve "Freedom from Hunger" gained momentum after World War II with the formation of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, which "strives to eradicate hunger, food insecurity and all forms of malnutrition." Since 1960, the human population has almost tripled, and, in association with the goal of reducing protein deficiency, the global chicken population has increased more than 10-fold. In parallel, the size and stocking density of intensively raised chicken enterprises have also increased significantly with positive and negative consequences for human and environmental health. The demand for cheap sources of animal protein has driven the selection of fast-growing meat chickens and layer hens that produce increased numbers of eggs per year. This has resulted in a range of unintended consequences, potentially playing a role in the H5N1 outbreak in dairy cattle we're facing today. The negative consequences relevant to public health include:Inbred chickens with diminished immune system function that shed more avian influenza virus after infection than more genetically heterogenous chickens.Increased prevalence of foodborne pathogens in chicken products associated with high stocking densities and commercial feed of varying quality.Environmental contamination due to improper disposal of poultry litter and manure, which may contain pesticide residues, microorganisms, pathogens, pharmaceuticals (antibiotics), hormones, and heavy metals.Exacerbation of climate change due to clearing of rainforest in the Amazon Basin to support the production of soya beans, a key component of commercial chicken feed.Reduced natural nutrient density in chicken meat due to diminished concentrations of micronutrients and changes in fatty acid ratios in association with fast growth and changes to chicken diets. Not a New Virus While our attention is currently focused on the avian influenza virus and its pandemic potential, it's important we mention that the emergence of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus recently reported in wildlife and dairy cattle has a long story. Outbreaks of HPAI have been increasing in frequency since the 1990s. The impact of HPAI outbreaks on large, intensive chicken farms led to the introduction of vaccination in Mexico in 1995. The following year, 1996, the progenitor of the HPAI subtype H5N1 recently found in U.S. dairy cattle emerged in water fowl in China. This HPAI H5N1 virus spread rapidly in East and Southeast Asia in the early 2000s, especially where the control of vaccine-preventable chicken diseases that are differential diagnoses for HPAI was poor (as high mortality in chickens was common prior to the arrival of HPAI). Unfortunately, the widespread culling of infected poultry without compensation in many countries has contributed to producers losing trust in veterinary services. Additionally, funding for national veterinary services is insufficient, resulting in inappropriate carcass disposal (which may contribute to environmental contamination) and improper vaccination coverage (which may have promoted the spread of virus mutations). The current spread of the HPAI H5N1 virus in dairy cattle in the U.S. will have been facilitated by the large herd sizes, regular movement of animals and fomites between production facilities, and the lack of genetic heterogeneity in the U.S. Holstein-Friesian national herd, with 9 million cows descending genetically from two sires. The Current Outbreak So, how did this situation unfold? Control policies have not adequately taken the socio-cultural and economic drivers of human behavior into account, potentially resulting in more rapid geographical spread of virus. Importantly, feasible prevention strategies must be tailored to the specific, potentially even local, socio-cultural, and epidemiological context within which avian influenza viruses are transmitted and amplified. The increasing amount and spread of avian influenza virus is concerning and does increase the likelihood of an influenza pandemic, which had already been predicted in early 2000 during the large-scale H5N1 outbreaks in poultry populations. The challenge of reducing pandemic risk by preventing viral spillover between animals and humans is the focus of the Lancet-PPATS Commission on Prevention of Viral Spillover. The commission is working to identify interventions that both reduce pandemic risk and contribute positively to food security and biodiversity gains, thereby delivering multiple returns on investment in these challenging economic times. Preventing Future Viral Evolution Looking forward, it is essential that we adopt a systems approach that recognizes the interdependence between ecological, epidemiological, and social factors so that more effective infectious disease prevention and control methods can be developed. This includes a move towards resilient food systems that promote the production of safe, sustainable, welfare-friendly animal-source food with optimal natural nutrient density via regenerative production systems. It is crucial that we seek out, and have affordable access to, diets that can sustainably meet the nutritional and cultural requirements of children, men, and women using an optimal mix of animal- and plant-source food. For those of us who are more affluent, this may mean consuming less meat, eggs, milk, and offal, while we simultaneously encourage food systems that enable vulnerable individuals and households to consume at least the minimum amount of animal source food to meet their requirements. The current situation of widespread avian influenza outbreaks in an increasing number of avian and mammalian species is worrying -- but it also presents an opportunity. The heightened media attention reminds us that we are all citizens of one world and when infectious diseases are allowed to smoulder on in some countries, they may eventually impact all of us. Importantly, we can still prevent future viral evolution if we work collaboratively through a One Health lens to deliver positive health outcomes for humans, animals, and the environment. Robyn Alders, PhD, is a registered vet and an honorary professor with the Development Policy Centre at the Australian National University and a commissioner with the Lancet-PPATS Commission on the prevention of viral spillover. Her research and development activities focus on development of sustainable infectious disease prevention and control in animals in resource-limited areas. Dirk Pfeiffer, Dr.med.vet, PhD, is the Chow Tak Fung Chair Professor of One Health at City University of Hong Kong, professor of veterinary epidemiology at the Royal Veterinary College in London, and a commissioner with the Lancet-PPATS Commission on the prevention of viral spillover. His research activities focus on the relationship between infectious disease spread in animals and the characteristics of eco-social systems in different parts of the world. Share on Facebook.

The H5N1 strain of bird flu has killed or caused the culling of hundreds of millions of poultry globally in recent years and has increasingly been spreading to mammals, including cows in the United States. The virus was detected in samples taken at the Mont Bouet poultry market in Libreville as part of epidemiological surveillance for avian influenza, the report submitted by Gabonese authorities to the Paris-based WOAH said. It noted that the samples identified as positive had been taken on birds from untraced farms, making traceback to the virus source impossible.

But it is highly contagious, so some shelters won’t accept dogs for a few weeks. An outbreak of dog flu has prompted the Humane Society of Tampa Bay to pause its intake of stray dogs for the first time in its 112-year history. It won't accept dogs until July 12 while it tries to contain the outbreak among the 200 dogs in its care. [ ANGELICA EDWARDS | Times ]By Sharon Kennedy WynneTimes staffPublished June 28|Updated July 1A bad outbreak of dog flu has stopped Hillsborough County’s two largest shelters from taking in stray dogs for the next two weeks as they try to halt the highly contagious infectious disease. Pasco County has also put a pause on taking in dogs for the next week as it tries to stop the spread.Hillsborough County’s Pet Resource Center moved 290 dogs out of its Falkenburg Road shelter so it can be deep-cleaned. Meanwhile, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay announced that for the first time in its 112-year history, it stopped accepting dogs starting on Wednesday and will keep the ban in place until July 13 to protect the more than 200 dogs in its care.Dogs run during play group at the Hillsborough County Pet Resource Center in Tampa. Canine influenza is more of a danger in shelters than private homes because it is highly contagious. [ IVY CEBALLO | Times (2021) ]The move does not affect cats, birds and other pets the shelters house.“Our leadership did not make this decision lightly,” said Humane Society CEO Sherry Silk, “Unfortunately, this is an unprecedented situation that calls for extreme and immediate action to protect dogs in Tampa Bay.”Pasco County Animal Services also suspended dog adoptions, intakes, surgeries and rescue transfers until at least July 3 “due to the presence of canine influenza,” an announcement said, but they have now extended it. “As a result of additional animals coming to the shelter and the continued need for testing, all dog operations will be suspended at Pasco County Animal Services at a minimum through July 18.”Canine influenza usually involves a dry cough that can last for a week or two, as well as runny eyes, fever and lethargy. While dogs do tend to get over the flu, it is considered a bigger problem in shelters than in private homes because of the large number of animals housed together, which helps it spread. It can’t be passed to humans, researchers say, but it can be spread to dogs through contact if the virus is present on fur, skin or clothing.After consulting with University of Florida researchers, Scott Trebatoski, director of the Hillsborough Pet Resource Center, said they were advised to just have a “clean break” to stem the tide of infections.“We tried isolating the dogs but because the virus spreads so easily in the air it wasn’t doing any good,” Trebatoski said. “We were fortunate that we were able to move them off-site so we can decontaminate the entire shelter.”He said the last big dog flu outbreak was in 2018 but it was in December, a time of year the shelter was empty enough to isolate the sick dogs. But summer is its busiest time, and they can sometimes take in 60-70 dogs a day.The closing comes near the week of July 4, one that sometimes sees a spike in runaway dogs who get frightened by fireworks.Trebatoski reminded pet owners to make sure their contact info is on their dog’s collar. And if you find a lost dog, he recommends walking around the neighborhood with it or post a picture on a neighborhood app or Facebook page. A majority of lost dogs are found within a block or two of their home, he said.“If people find a dog while we are going through this, we are trying to encourage people to keep them until we reopen July 14,” Trebatoski said, “and if they need something like food or crates, just reach out to us.”Sharon Kennedy Wynne is a reporter covering events, things to do and family experiences through the region.

The aim of this study is to understand the seasonal pattern and surge of respiratory viruses among the Nicobarese tribe.MethodsRespiratory specimens were collected from both ARI and SARI cases attended the BJR district hospital in Car Nicobar Island, India, between 2021 and 2022. Respiratory viruses were identified from the specimens by using the qRT-PCR assay. Meteorological parameters were collected and evaluated using Microsoft Excel and SPSS 21. The significant association between the surge of respiratory viruses and each climatic parameter was evaluated.ResultsIn this hospital-based cross-sectional study, 471 ILI cases were enrolled, and 209 of these were positive for respiratory viral infections. Of these respiratory virus infections, 201 (96.2%) were infected with a single respiratory virus infection, and 8 (3.8%) had mixed viral infections. Fever, cough, and chills were the most common symptoms of respiratory illness among this indigenous population. There was a significant link between respiratory viruses and influenza-like illness in children (below 5 years and 6 to 15 years).ConclusionThis prevalence study revealed that viral respiratory infections were more common in children than adults. Among these respiratory viruses, respiratory syncytial virus A (RSV) and influenza B virus were predominantly reported among tribal children up to age five years. In the year 2021, these viruses were recorded frequently during the winter season. Climate factors such as high humidity, high precipitation, moderate temperature, and moderate rainfall are found to be correlated with respiratory viral infections. This study implicates important information for preventing a further outbreak of respiratory viral infections in Car Nicobar Island. Peer Review reports IntroductionHuman respiratory virus infections cause a wide array of respiratory symptoms and severe illness, resulting in morbidity, mortality, and economic losses worldwide. According to the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 report, the global burden of respiratory infections reached 17.2 billion in 2019 [1]. Fever, cough, sore throat, nasal stiffness, and headache are the most frequent symptoms of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) [2]. A significant range of respiratory viruses that infect humans have been discovered to be extremely contagious for individuals of various ages [3]. In addition to influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human meta-pneumovirus (hMPV), human coronaviruses (HCoV), adenoviruses (AdV), and parainfluenza viruses (PIV) have been associated to infections in both children and adults [4, 5].Climatic factors are associated with an increase in the circulation of respiratory viruses at particular duration of a year. Furthermore some respiratory viruses like RSV and Influenza virus were appeared during winter season. However, Rhinovirus had two upsurge that occurs during October to November and in March. Moreover, Adenovirus was circulated throughout the year. RSV and Influenza A virus were prevailing in the high relative humidity and low temperature. Nevertheless, HMPV will circulate in the warmer temperature [6].The Nicobar Islands in the Indian Ocean are located approximately 1,300 km southeast of the Indian subcontinent, across the Bay of Bengal (1,841 square km). The Nicobar Islands, along with the Andaman Islands to the north, constitute the boundary between the south-eastern Bay of Bengal (west) and the Andaman Sea (east) [7]. Car Nicobar is a small (49 square kilometers) remote island that can be reached by sea or air from Port Blair, the main city of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It is situated 260 km from Port Blair. The Nicobarese tribes (mongoloids), one of six indigenous aboriginal tribes of Car Nicobar Island, have a population of 17,841 (> 98% Nicobarese) as of the 2011 census, and has a tropical climate since it lies 9 degrees south from the equator [8]. The climate in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands is varied, with both the first and second monsoons bringing heavy rain. The regular travel of this tribe to Port Blair for personal chores, where tourists visit from India and all over the globe especially, raises the possibility of many respiratory infections spreading to this remote island.Children's respiratory disorders are a growing concern for morbidity and mortality in developing countries, especially, when they are linked to chronic respiratory diseases [9]. Due to weakened immunity and other factors, respiratory infections were more common in children and adults with influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) [10].Our previous study from Car Nicobar Island revealed the existence of several respiratory viral infections among Nicobarese tribes, with influenza virus being the most prevalent [11]. A deeper understanding of seasonal patterns, if any, in relation to respiratory virus infections among the indigenous community in the Car Nicobar Island is required. Therefore, the aim and objective of this study was to identify respiratory viruses and comprehend the climatic factors related to these viruses infections among the Nicobarese tribe in India during the years 2021 and 2022.MethodologyStudy design and populationA hospital-based cross-sectional study was carried out at the BJR hospital in Car Nicobar Island, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India (1st June 2021 to 31st May 2022). A total of 5840 patients of various age groups from the aboriginal Nicobarese tribe reported to the BJR hospital throughout the study period.Study areaCar Nicobar (9.1573° N, 92.7581° E) is a small island that lies in proximity to neighboring countries, i.e. Myanmar, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The Nicobarese tribe has inhabited this Island, which is located near the equator and has a tropical climate.Case definitionInfluenza-like illness (ILI)An acute respiratory infection with measured fever of ≥ 38 °C and a cough with onset within the 10 days [12].Severe acute respiratory illness (SARI)Acute respiratory illness requiring hospitalization that has started within the past 10 days and has a history of fever or a recorded fever of ≥ 38 °C as well as cough [12].Inclusion criteriaPatients having symptoms of acute respiratory tract infections, primarily ILI and SARI were included.Exclusion criteriaPatients with confirmed TB, chronic respiratory illness such as lung cancer, COPD and Asthma, patient with bacterial infections and patients unwilling to participate in the study were excluded from the study.Collection of samplesThe collection of respiratory specimens including throat and nasal swabs was done for the patients who visited BJR Hospital during the study period with suspected cases of ILI and SARI after obtaining written informed consent from the patients. In the case of children, the written consent of the parent or legal guardian was obtained. The respiratory sample was taken with the assistance of a physician or a skilled nurse. Furthermore, the collected samples were handled and transported according to the standard operating procedures [13].Data collectionThe participants in this study were recruited based on their presenting signs and symptoms between June 2021 and May 2022. Data related to the socio-demographic profile, travel history, and clinical manifestations were collected through the use of a pre-established questionnaire (Supplementary file 1).The personal information, clinical observations, and epidemiological data pertaining to these cases were documented in the clinical proforma. Data was obtained from patients diagnosed with Influenza-like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) in various hospital settings at BJR Hospital in Car Nicobar, India. The data was entered into Microsoft Excel version 2016. The ILI and SARI cases were chosen in accordance with specific inclusion criteria, symptoms, and case definition.Laboratory testingRibonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted using the MagMax-96 viral RNA isolation kit (Invitrogen, Thermo-Fischer Scientific, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Utilizing the Invitrogen Superscript III one-step quantitative RT-PCR kit, real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using a set of previously published primers and probes to detect respiratory viruses including Human Coronavirus-229E (HCOV -229E), Organ Culture 43 (OC43), Hong Kong University 1 (HKU1), NetherLand 63 (NL63), influenza A virus, influenza B virus, human adenovirus (HAdV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), para-influenza virus (PIV) 1, 2, 3, and 4, and rhinovirus (Invitrogen, Thermo Fischer Scientific, USA) [14].Type-specific primers and probes for HCoV 229E, NL63, and OC43 were chosen based on the N gene's highly conserved genomic regions. The fluorogenic probes of HCoV 229E, NL63, and OC43 that can be labelled with several fluorogenic dyes were labelled with a 5′ reporter dye, 6-carboxy-fluorescein, and a 3′ quencher dye, 6-carboxytetramethyl-rhodamine [14]. The ABI 7500 equipment was used for this RT-PCR test (Applied Biosystems Inc, USA). A total of 25 µL of PCR reaction mixture was prepared using 10 µmol of forward and reverse primers, 5 µmol of Taqman probe, 12.5 µL of 2X buffer, 0.5 µL of superscript TM III enzyme, and 5 µL of nucleic acid template. The PCR Assay took 45 cycles to complete, including an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, denaturation at 94 °C for 15 s, and annealing at 55 °C for 30 s [11, 14]. The identification of all target viruses was confirmed using a positive and negative controls consisting of in vitro transcribed RNAs.Meteorological dataCar Nicobar Island encompasses (9.17°N 92.78°E) is extremely level, with the exception of few cliffs in the north and a few mountainous places in the interior. Daily data of Rainfall (in millimeter) and relative humidity (in percentage) for Car Nicobar Island from June 01, 2021 to May 31, 2022 were gathered from IMD, Pune's CEIC data (https://www.ceicdata.com/en/). Moreover, NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), Deutscher Wetterdienst, Canada (https://meteostat.net/en/) provided the daily data of temperature (in degree Celsius) and precipitation (in millimeter). Monthly average (mean) data (June, 2021 to May, 2022) of rainfall, relative humidity, temperature, and precipitation for Car Nicobar Island were analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Month wise mean data was compared with the monthly distribution of respiratory viruses during the same period.Statistical data analysisSurveillance data of respiratory viruses among Nicobarese in Car Nicobar were entered, and stored in Microsoft Excel version 2016, and. Descriptive statistics of was performed by using SPSS 21(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Chi-square test was used to compare the categorical data. In addition, month wise data of climatic factors (rainfall, relative humidity, temperature, and precipitation) were compared with various respiratory viruses reported during the same period using a T-test. P-value less than 0.05 were considered as significant.Ethical considerationThe institutional ethical committee of the ICMR—Regional Medical Research Centre, Port Blair, approved the study (Proposal No.9) on January 11, 2019. Respiratory specimens were obtained in accordance with human ethical rules and requirements. Informed consent was obtained from each patient who participated in this study, and in the case of minors (children and adolescents), informed consent from a parent and/or legal guardian was sought.ResultDemographic and clinical characteristicsIn this study, 5840 patients with influenza-like illness visited to the outpatient and inpatient settings of BJR District hospital in Car-Nicobar. Respiratory samples were collected from 471 enrolled patients of the total 5840 patients with ILI, and tested for respiratory viruses. The median age of ILI and SARI patients was 22 years old (IQR: 7 – 36 years). The median age of ILI cases attending outpatient settings was high compared to the hospitalized cases (M = 9, IQR: 3–32 vs. M = 3, IQR: 1–8.5). Out of the total 5840 individuals with influenza-like illness (ILI), 212 patients (3.6%) were admitted to the hospital due to severe acute respiratory illness (SARI), while the remaining 5628 cases (96.4%) have been treated as outpatients. The majority of the patients attended the outpatient setting was compared with hospitalized cases. Compared to inpatient settings, more women were attended in outpatient settings (51.6% vs. 46.2%).Nevertheless, the percentage of male patients attending the outpatient settings was lower than the hospitalized cases (OPD vs. IPD: 78.5% vs. 21.5%). Hospitalized (inpatient) settings had a higher frequency of instances (67.7%) than outpatient settings among children under the age of five. The demographic features of ILI in Car-Nicobar are elucidated in Table 1. Among these 5840 ILI cases, the most common symptoms were cough (74.6%), fever (51.4%), sore throat (15.5%), chills (11.1%), and runny nose (3.5%). Figure 1 illustrates the symptomatic distribution of ILI patients in Car Nicobar. Table 1 Demographic characteristics of patients with ILI in Car-Nicobar, India (2021 – 2022)Full size tableFig. 1Symptomatic distribution of ILI in Car-Nicobar (A shows the symptomatic distribution of total ILI cases attended the hospital (N = 5840) & B depicts the symptomatic distribution of enrolled ILI cases in this study (N = 471)Full size imageDetection of respiratory virusesOf the 471 ILI cases enrolled for laboratory testing, 209 (44.4%) samples tested positive for respiratory viral infection, whereas 262 (55.6%) tested negative for all respiratory viruses (Table 1). Almost equal proportions of male (101/209; 48.3%) and female (108/209; 51.7%) were infected with respiratory viruses. The Median age of ILI patients with respiratory viral infections was 3 years old (IQR: 1–8 years). There was a decline in the percentage of cases that tested positive for respiratory viruses with age. Positive rates for respiratory viruses were higher in age groups under 5 years old (more than 65%) than in age ranges 56 to 65 (2/20) 10%. Figure 2 depicts the positive rates of single infection and viral-viral co-infection.Fig. 2Positive rates of single viral respiratory infection and viral-viral co-infection with different age groups (Blue cone indicates the single viral respiratory infection and orange cylinder represents the viral-viral co-infections.)Full size imageThe prevalence of viral-viral co-infections with respiratory viruses was 3.8% (8/209) across all samples, with children over 16 having a lowest positivity rate than those under 5 years old. Among the positive respiratory virus cases, mixed viral infection was detected with the combination of HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 (N = 1); IAV (H3N2) and RSV-A (N = 1); rhinovirus and HCoV-HKU1 (N = 1); IBV and RSV-A (N = 3), and hMPV and RSV-A (N = 2). The prevalence of viral-viral co-infection among Nicobarese in Car Nicobar is shown in Table 2. Table 2 Detection of viral-viral co-infection cases with ILI during 2021 and 2022Full size tableViral etiologyAmong the enrolled cases (N = 471), 209 were positive for respiratory viral infections. Of these respiratory viral infections, 201 patients (96.2%) tested positive for a single respiratory viral infection, and 8 (3.8%) tested positive for mixed respiratory viral infection. Among positive respiratory viruses, RSV-A was the most often found respiratory virus, i.e., 63.6%, followed by influenza B virus (9.7%), human rhinovirus (6.9%), HCoV-HKU1 (5.1%), PIV-1 (0.5%), PIV-4 (1.8%), and PIV-3 (2.3%), and hMPV (4.6%). The percentage of HCoV-NL63 and Influenza A viruses were lower than 2.0%. The percentage distribution of respiratory viruses in Car Nicobar was depicted in Fig. 3.Fig. 3Distribution of respiratory viruses in Car Nicobar Island (Grey section represent the distribution of Rhinovirus, Adenovirus, PIV-1, PIV-3, PIV-4, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63.)Full size imageAge and gender distributionThe distribution of respiratory virus infection by age and gender was determined by evaluating the data. Gender-wise analysis revealed that adenovirus, HCoV, and RSV-A were reported more frequently among females than males. However, influenza B virus, hMPV, and rhinovirus were reported high among males compared to females. Other respiratory viral pathogens did not have any gender predominance. Additionally, there were no age-related changes in respiratory viruses that were statistically significant ()(p ≤ 0.05). Influenza A virus, Influenza B virus, RSV-A, HAdV, and PIV were most commonly observed among children under the age of five.Viral pathogens such as hMPV, HCoV, PIV, and influenza virus were found less frequently in children aged 6 to 15 years. While rhinovirus was prevalent in those aged 16 to 25, HCoV was found in those aged 26 to 35. A spectrum of respiratory viruses among different age groups is shown in Fig. 4.Fig. 4Respiratory viruses among different age groupsFull size imageRespiratory viruses among childrenViral respiratory infections were more common in children less than the age of five and in this study, RSV-A was the most predominantly reported virus among them. Meanwhile, the influenza B virus was prevalent among children. In addition, few cases of other respiratory viruses such as HAdV, hMPV, and PIV were reported.Seasonal distributionThe viral respiratory infection was analyzed as per its seasonal variation. From June 2021 to May 2022 (Fig. 5), RSV-A has a seasonal peak in October 2021. The influenza B virus also increased in October, November, and December 2021. Similarly, hMPV was prevalent during the same seasonal months when RSV-A was on upsurge. HAdV was distributed throughout the year sporadically. However, human rhinovirus and PIV-1, 3, and 4 has increased from the month January 2022 to May 2022. Meanwhile, common coronaviruses HCoV –HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 were also recorded in the months of July 2021, February 2022, March 2022, and April 2022, respectively.Fig. 5A Month wise distribution of RSV-A and B. Depicts the month wise distribution of the respiratory virusesFull size imageAssociation with the weatherThe annual mean temperature and relative humidity were 27.2 °C and 89.84% respectively. The monthly average (mean) temperature in Car Nicobar Island was low in the month of November 2021 (mean (x̄): 26.6; CI: 26.4 – 26.9) followed by October 2021 (x̄: 26.8; CI: 26.7 – 27.0). Respiratory viral infections were recorded as being low during this period. However, the highest temperature was recorded in the month of April 2022 (x̄: 28.3; CI: 27.9 – 28.6) followed by May 2022 (x̄: 27.9; CI: 27.5 – 28.3) and June 2021(x̄: 27.9; CI: 27.6 – 28.1). There were very few respiratory viruses reported in April (2022) and May (2022), and no cases were reported in June 2021. There was a significant relationship (p < 0.05) between the monthly average temperature and the rise in respiratory viruses. In addition, precipitation was recorded as high in March 2022 (x̄: 12.3; CI: 3.6 – 25.8) followed by November 2021 (x̄: 11.1; CI: 7.9 – 14.5). In this period, more frequent respiratory viral infections were reported. There was a significant correlation between monthly average precipitation and a surge of respiratory viruses (p < 0.05). Moreover, relative humidity was recorded as high during the month of September (x̄: 93.9; CI: 92.4 – 95.4), October (x̄: 92.3; CI: 90.2 – 94.2), November (x̄: 92.9; CI: 90.8 – 95.0) and March (x̄: 93.3; CI: 87.7 – 98.0). High relative humidity was recorded during the peak of the respiratory viral infection (October and November). There was a significant association between humidity and the respiratory viruses reported (p < 0.05). However, rainfall was recorded high in September (x̄: 194.9; CI: 182.5 – 206.5) followed by April (x̄: 162.4; CI: 150.5 – 172.8). Average rainfall was recorded during the upsurge of respiratory viral infections (RSV-A, and influenza B virus). The relative association between rainfall and respiratory viruses was not significant (p = 0.38). The prevalence of respiratory viruses increased when there was a moderate temperature, and rainfall. However, relative humidity and precipitation were high during the surge of respiratory viruses (Fig. 6).Fig. 6Correlation between the upsurge of respiratory viral infection and Climatic conditions [(A) temperature, (B) relative humidity, (C) rainfall, and (D) precipitation]Full size imageDiscussionFor many years, researchers have studied and disputed the factors that underpin the seasonality of respiratory virus infections. Temperature and humidity may affect respiratory virus stability and transmission rates. ARI and SARI is critical public health issues among Nicobarese tribes living in Car Nicobar Island in India. Current research has highlighted the role of environmental variables particularly temperatures and changes in rainfall, relative humidity, and precipitation patterns may have an influence on health of indigenous tribes especially children and elder people in the remote Car Nicobar Island.Respiratory viruses cause major morbidity and mortality in adults, particularly in elderly with chronic comorbid illnesses [5]. In the Asia–Pacific area, influenza virus circulation varied greatly, with an abnormally high load of influenza B. Overall, influenza B was responsible for 31.4 percent of cases in the Asia–Pacific region [15]. RSV is thought to be the cause of a large number of hospitalizations worldwide, in both industrialized and developing countries. RSV symptoms might range from being asymptomatic to flu-like symptoms to having acute respiratory distress. RSV-A appears to dominate RSV-B in several long-term studies around the world [16]. In this study, the upsurge of RSV-A and influenza B viruses were detected after the COVID-19 pandemic in Car Nicobar Island. Numerous respiratory viruses, including influenza A(H3N2), influenza A(H1N1)PDM, hMPV, HAdV, rhinovirus, and HCoV, were found in this population in a recent report [11].It is estimated that 3 lakh hospital admissions for RSV-ARI in older adults occur worldwide. Many studies have identified that hospitalization of ARI and SARI as high but the previous studies in Car Nicobar found that patient visited outpatient settings was high [11, 17]. Similarly, in this study, outpatient cases were high compared to hospitalized cases. In the study, there was no discernible gender-specific preponderance in the incidence of ILI cases (P > 0.05). Compared to cases that were hospitalized, the proportion of women attending outpatient settings was higher than that of males. There were no cases of COVID-19 during the study, which may be due to the stringent preventive measures that were followed to control the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 among this indigenous tribe [11].In this study, the positivity rate of the respiratory viruses was high among children under the age of five. However, there were low positive rates for older age groups (those over 55 years old). Compared to the previous study, respiratory viral infections such as the RSV-A and Influenza B viruses were high among children [11]. Earlier study has reported school going children to be more frequently exposed to influenza virus than other age groups [18]. Among children less than five years, influenza virus, RSV-A, adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus were most commonly identified. This may be due to the schools reopening and the relaxation of stringent measures after the COVID-19 pandemic. The prevalence of respiratory viral pathogens was lower among other age groups. A study from India revealed that the number of respiratory viruses was high among adults, especially those aged 19 to 59 [19].In most examinations, detection of two or more respiratory viruses at the same time in paediatric patients ranges from 10 to 30% [20, 21]. When compared to respiratory infection alone, previous research indicated that the co-infection of respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus was protective against the length of hospital stay and hypoxia [21]. In addition, a study revealed that children who had both rhinovirus and RSV infections experienced a shorter duration of hospitalization compared to infants only infected with RSV [22]. Co-infections with the lowest incidence rate have been reported among cases older than 16 years.Every virus has a seasonal cycle, with peak seasons for activity. A study from the Canary Islands reported that RSV infections showed the same epidemiological pattern as in temperate climates [23]. In a previous study, the majority of viral pathogens exhibited a seasonal pattern of incidence. The prevalence and seasonal variability of respiratory viral agents that are relevant to developing nations must be determined by thorough studies [24]. This island's proximity to the equator and the sea causes its climate to be hot, humid, and consistent, and the islands receive rain from both the northeast and southwest monsoons. The humidity of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands ranges from 76 to 80% on average. Maximum precipitation occurs between May and December [25]. RSV and influenza A virus required a narrow range of humidity, while PIV type 3 needed a dry season. HAdV, influenza A and B, RSV, and hMPV are best suited to cold temperatures [26]. In our study, the prevalence of RSV-A, hMPV, and influenza B virus were reported during the winter season. However, HAdV distribution has been observed all through the year. The rhinovirus has two peaks, one significant in October–November and one moderate in March. During high humidity and precipitation conditions with moderate temperature and rainfall, a surge of respiratory viruses was reported. There was a significant association between respiratory virus infection and climatic factors (P < 0.05).India's Nicobar Islands are a stretch of tropical islands that are situated in the Bay of Bengal, strategically close to Southeast Asian (SEA) nations including Myanmar, Thailand, and Indonesia. Poachers from SEA countries to the Nicobar Islands exploit living marine resources and pose a serious threat of transmitting emerging infectious diseases [27]. Recent studies from Thailand, revealed the predominant influenza viruses, RSV, and adenoviruses among children with SARI and pneumonia [28, 29]. The current study confirmed the presence of influenza viruses and RSV-A among the Nicobarese tribe in Car Nicobar, which is located on the international border line between India and Thailand. This island's pattern of respiratory virus infection differed from that of India's mainland. It may be due to the geographical location and climatic factors of this island. Respiratory viruses like Influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2 has a potency of transmission from animal to humans or human to animals [30]. Since Car Nicobar Island is a tribal reserve, only people of the Nicobarese tribe are allowed to enter. This population is at risk for emerging and re-emerging viral strains due to reasons such as travel by these people to other regions, hunting activities on these islands, the rearing of pigs, and migrating birds.Limited treatment options are available for the respiratory virus infections. Some of the antiviral drugs are prescribed for supportive care to reduce the severity of respiratory viral infection. Broad- spectrum antiviral agents like Ribavirin was used for the treatment of RSV,CoV, Adenovirus and Parainfluenza virus. Further, neuraminidase inhibitor such as Oseltamivir was recommended for the treatment of Influenza virus. SARS-CoV-2 causes a wide range of wild and farm animals, humans as well as birds. An experimental study revealed a antiviral activity of Ivermectin against CoV virus.Genomic variants of this virus may cause future epidemic or pandemic due to the rapid evolution of corona viruses [31, 32].In light of current data, we declare the upsurge of respiratory infections, especially RSV-A and influenza B viruses were predominant among tribal children. Increased activity of RSV-A was seen among children; nevertheless, the transmission of other respiratory viruses like PIVs, rhinovirus, HCoV, and HAdV were all still at low levels. Additionally, a small number of patients had influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 at the same time. The treatment for respiratory viruses has been focused to lowers the influenza symptoms such as fever, and cough. In the future, more investigation needs to be performed to understand the transmission of respiratory viruses in indigenous tribal groups, and the knowledge gathered would aid policymakers in preventing respiratory disease among tribal children in remote islands. This study emphasizes the importance of ongoing respiratory virus surveillance as a public health tool to prevent future epidemics on this remote island. The current investigation will aid in understanding the background activities like age-related factors, seasonal variations, and climatic factors with the pandemic potential to cause respiratory infections in Car Nicobar, the remote islands.LimitationsThe demographic and clinical data was collected from the patients attending inpatient and outpatient settings of the hospital. Only ILI and SARI patients were recruited while chronic respiratory cases were not included in this study. Due to unwillingness and hesitance of indigenous Nicobarese tribe, the enrolment of participant (sample collected) in this study was low.The study was limited with patients accomplish with the given case definition and eligibility criteria.ConclusionThis study looked into the causes of acute respiratory viral infections in Nicobarese tribes in Car Nicobar, India. Upsurges of RSV-A and influenza B virus on this remote island were identified during this study period. The respiratory viruses reported on this island had a significant association with age factors and climatic conditions. Nicobarese children under 5 years were more commonly affected with these respiratory viruses. Further, seasonal pattern of these respiratory viruses in this remote island was revealed through this study. These findings emphasize the need for continuous surveillance of respiratory viral infections and their types in the remote islands where the indigenous people are inhabited. This type of research is necessary for improving and optimizing diagnostic strategies as well as developing approaches for preventing emerging respiratory viral infections.

(ABC News: Morgan Timms)abc.net.auews/avian-flu-detected-in-act/104027322Link copiedShareShare articleIn short: Australia's avian influenza outbreak has spread to a farm in Canberra, which has been quarantined.ACT biosecurity authorities said the virus was transmitted during the transporting of eggs and associated materials from an affected site in New South Wales. What's next? The government says the territory is "well positioned" to respond to the event. The ACT government has confirmed the territory's first case of avian influenza has been detected at a Canberra farm, which has been quarantined.Biosecurity authorities said the virus was brought to the ACT from New South Wales via the transporting of eggs and associated materials for commercial grading.They said the territory was "well positioned to respond to this event, which is localised to a single property".The ACT's acting chief veterinary officer, Dr Kyeelee Driver, said the government received information on Tuesday morning that the ACT premises — a commercial chicken farm, which also operates an egg-grading facility — contained animals that could potentially be infected with avian influenza.Testing, including by the CSIRO's Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness laboratories, then confirmed the presence of the high-pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) H7N8 strain, and subsequently established a link with an infected site in New South Wales. Transmission believed to have happened during transport, not from wild birdsDr Driver said no "unusual" bird deaths had been reported at the facility on Monday during surveillance, and it's believed the transmission occurred during the transporting of eggs and associated materials, like packaging cartons and trucks, rather than live chickens.Authorities do not believe the transmission took place from wild birds in a "spillover" event. The ACT facility is understood to have "very good biosecurity" in place, and has been "made biosecure", but officials are currently assessing how many birds will need to be destroyed.Dr Driver said the response was in line with the national strategy while ACT Health authorities said they were "working closely with … colleagues in NSW and Victoria" to respond to the incident.ACT Environment Minister Rebecca Vassarotti says there is no food safety risk to consumers. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)Environment Minister Rebecca Vassarotti sought to reassure the community of the low risk of avian influenza virus."Transmission to humans is very rare, and unlikely unless there is direct and close contact with sick birds," she said.“Further, avian influenza is not a food safety concern and it is safe to eat properly handled and cooked poultry meat, eggs and egg products."The federal government's outbreak information also states current strains of avian influenza do not appear to transmit easily between humans, and eggs and chicken meat are safe to eat provided they are handled and cooked according to standard food-handling practices.To date, there have been no reports of human cases of bird flu in the ACT. Anyone suspected of exposure at the affected property will be monitored for symptoms.The government couldn't say how long depopulation and decontamination efforts would take, but encouraged the community to "be aware" and contact the Emergency Animal Disease Hotline with any concerns.Avian flu outbreaks happening across the countryVirus strain HPAI H7N8 was also detected on a large poultry egg farm in the Hawkesbury district of NSW last week.The HPAI H7N8 strain is not the same as the H5N1 strain that is causing concern globally.It is also not connected to the Victorian outbreak of the H7N3 and H7N9 strains, which have impacted seven farms in the state.More than 1 million chickens have had to be culled in response to the outbreak of the highly contagious and deadly H7 strains of bird flu at farms in Meredith, Terang, and other locations in western Victoria, including a commercial duck farm.A low-pathogenic case of bird flu was also detected in Western Australia last month.Posted Thu 27 Jun 2024 at 4:05amThursday 27 Jun 2024 at 4:05amThu 27 Jun 2024 at 4:05am, updated Thu 27 Jun 2024 at 4:39amThursday 27 Jun 2024 at 4:39amThu 27 Jun 2024 at 4:39amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesFamily shares tribute for Eleanor Bryant, teacher's aide killed when truck crashed into preschoolTopic:Road Accidents and IncidentsPhoto shows Eleanor Bryant, who was killed when a truck crashed into a Victorian preschool, pictured smiling at the races.Early election speculation reaches a fever pitch as Albanese announces two candidates in two hoursTopic:ElectionsPhoto shows A man in a black suit and a yellow tie stands at a podium, addressing the press and gesturing to the crowd.Donald Trump and the one big threat to Australia's almost $4 trillion superannuation systemDAnalysis by David TaylorPhoto shows SuperannuationUnder proposed laws the truth about COVID-19 could have been struck from the internetTopic:Social MediaPhoto shows A row of people looking at their phones with one set of hands and phone in focus.

Post IllustrationbookmarkfacebooktwitterWhatsappmail Arjun PoudelPublished at : June 25, 2024 Updated at : June 25, 2024 07:18 At least 1,072 people from across the country have been infected with A(H1N1), also known as the swine flu virus, since January, this year.Data provided by the National Public Health Laboratory shows that 373 others were infected with the influenza B virus, 75 with the A (H3) virus, also known as Hong Kong Flu, 13 with co-infection of swine flu and coronavirus, and two with co-infection of influenza B and coronavirus. What concerns public virologists and infectious disease experts in Nepal is that less than one-fifth of cases of influenza-like illnesses are diagnosed, and neither the doctors attending patients nor the authorities concerned bother to know the real cause of ailments. They say that of the swab samples of 8,739 people with an influenza-like illness, only 1,743 tested positive for various kinds of influenza. “The cause of ailments of the rest of people are not known, which should be a cause of serious concern to the researchers as well as policymakers,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “The criteria for collecting the swab samples for influenza test is that patients should have an influenza-like illness, but only less than one-fifth of samples are testing positive for influenza.”The laboratory only maintains a record of the positive cases but does not tell anything about fatalities due to infections. Experts say the number of people infected with influenza could be several times higher than the data provided by the laboratory, as many people suffering from influenza-like illness do not seek treatment. Even for those who do seek treatment, in most cases, the underlying cause of their ailments often remains undiagnosed. “The next pandemic could also be a pandemic of respiratory viruses,” said Pun. “We will not be able to lessen the risk of outbreaks in future if we continue ignoring the risks. Authorities must step up surveillance and investigate the underlying causes of these ailments.”A recent report by the Nepal Statistics Office also shows that cold and fever remain a significant concern, with an increase from 43.7 percent in 1995/96 to 51. 5 percent in 2022/23.Doctors say more people get infected with viruses during the seasonal changes, as most viruses—adenovirus, rhinovirus, influenza virus, and even coronavirus—become active during these times and winter.But this does not mean respiratory viruses do not spread at other times. “People are getting continuously infected with respiratory viruses in other seasons as well. Those with weak immunity could become more severely affected by the infection,” said Dr Raju Pangeni, a pulmonologist. “Besides urging people to take precautions against these risks, authorities must step up surveillance measures to know the real causes of influenza-like illnesses.”As very few people in Nepal receive flu shots. Experts say unvaccinated elderly people and those with compromised immunity are at risk of severe respiratory virus infections.Doctors say the influenza virus causes respiratory complications, which affect the lungs. It quickly spreads in communities. The diseases can cause fever, cough, body aches, occasional vomiting, diarrhoea and pneumonia.They say that early diagnosis is crucial for preventing infection. Patients recover quickly if treated on time. Both the severity of the disease and the number of deaths increase if seasonal influenza cases are not diagnosed on time, according to experts.

Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico and Texas will be in the first round of voluntary participation, with other states likely to follow, USDA officials said on a call with reporters. (Photo by Diana Cervantes for Source NM) WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Tuesday that four states will launch voluntary pilot programs in the days ahead to test bulk milk tanks on dairy farms for bird flu — a move that’s aimed at making it easier for farmers to ship herds across state lines and for public health officials to track spread of the virus. Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico and Texas will be in the first round of voluntary participation, with other states likely to follow, officials said on a call with reporters. “This list of participating states is just the beginning,” said Eric Deeble, the acting senior advisor for H5N1 response at USDA. “We are in close conversation with about a dozen other states who are very interested in participating as well,” Deeble said. “But it was important for us to get these four states going so that other states could watch how the program works and gain additional confidence.” The launch of the pilot program, he said, is “an important step forward” for efforts to reduce the spread of bird flu, also known as H5N1, as well as for expanding understanding of the virus. Farmers who voluntarily enter the program will be able to move their herds across state lines without additional testing after bulk milk tanks or similar representative samples test negative for H5N1 for three consecutive weeks. “Producers must also comply with continued regular weekly monitoring and testing of their herd for H5N1, but that process can happen with very little effort on the part of the producer, using routine bulk milk samples,” Deeble said. 126 cases of bird flu confirmed The announcement is part of the federal government’s ongoing response to the months-long outbreak within dairy cattle and years-long challenges faced by the country’s poultry industry. The USDA has confirmed 126 cases of bird flu in dairy cattle herds in a dozen states as of June 21, including Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming. Idaho has the most dairy herds affected, with a total of 27. That’s followed by Michigan with 25 herds and Texas with 21 herds. Colorado has reported 18 affected herds, while each of the other states has fewer than 10 herds testing positive for bird flu, according to the USDA data. Three dairy farmworkers have contracted avian flu this year, though all cases were mild. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reinforced during the call Tuesday that the risk to the general public remains low, though there is an increased risk of contracting the virus for workers, both on dairy farms and poultry farms. FDA to do more testing The U.S. Food and Drug Administration also announced Tuesday it’s broadening its testing for H5N1 to include about 155 additional samples of dairy products, including aged raw milk cheese, cream cheese, butter and ice cream. The FDA has repeatedly tested pasteurized milk from store shelves in the months since the first dairy cattle herd tested positive for H5N1 and has continuously emphasized the nation’s milk supply remains safe. “This retail sampling effort is intended to address remaining geographic and product gaps from the initial sampling of the commercial milk supply that FDA conducted between April and May of this year,” said Don Prater, acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the FDA. It will likely take several weeks before those results are completed and made public, he said. That second round of expanded food safety testing will not include raw milk, since it is not approved for interstate commerce, he said. But the FDA has sent a letter to its local, state and tribal partners, cautioning those that do allow the sale of raw milk to talk with consumers about the additional risks, given that H5N1 is spreading through dairy herds in several parts of the country. Prater, speaking on the call Tuesday, noted the FDA continues to strongly advise against drinking raw milk. “We also recommend that the industry does not manufacture or sell raw milk or raw milk products, including raw milk cheese made with milk from cows showing symptoms of illness, including those infected with the avian influenza viruses or exposed to those infected with avian influenza viruses.” KansasNebraskaNew MexicoTexas XNM joins three states to begin voluntary testing for bird flu in dairy farm milk tanks by Jennifer Shutt, Source New Mexico June 25, 2024 NM joins three states to begin voluntary testing for bird flu in dairy farm milk tanks by Jennifer Shutt, Source New Mexico June 25, 2024 WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Tuesday that four states will launch voluntary pilot programs in the days ahead to test bulk milk tanks on dairy farms for bird flu — a move that’s aimed at making it easier for farmers to ship herds across state lines and for public health officials to track spread of the virus. Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico and Texas will be in the first round of voluntary participation, with other states likely to follow, officials said on a call with reporters. “This list of participating states is just the beginning,” said Eric Deeble, the acting senior advisor for H5N1 response at USDA. “We are in close conversation with about a dozen other states who are very interested in participating as well,” Deeble said. “But it was important for us to get these four states going so that other states could watch how the program works and gain additional confidence.” The launch of the pilot program, he said, is “an important step forward” for efforts to reduce the spread of bird flu, also known as H5N1, as well as for expanding understanding of the virus. Farmers who voluntarily enter the program will be able to move their herds across state lines without additional testing after bulk milk tanks or similar representative samples test negative for H5N1 for three consecutive weeks. “Producers must also comply with continued regular weekly monitoring and testing of their herd for H5N1, but that process can happen with very little effort on the part of the producer, using routine bulk milk samples,” Deeble said. 126 cases of bird flu confirmed The announcement is part of the federal government’s ongoing response to the months-long outbreak within dairy cattle and years-long challenges faced by the country’s poultry industry. The USDA has confirmed 126 cases of bird flu in dairy cattle herds in a dozen states as of June 21, including Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming. Idaho has the most dairy herds affected, with a total of 27. That’s followed by Michigan with 25 herds and Texas with 21 herds. Colorado has reported 18 affected herds, while each of the other states has fewer than 10 herds testing positive for bird flu, according to the USDA data. Three dairy farmworkers have contracted avian flu this year, though all cases were mild. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reinforced during the call Tuesday that the risk to the general public remains low, though there is an increased risk of contracting the virus for workers, both on dairy farms and poultry farms. FDA to do more testing The U.S. Food and Drug Administration also announced Tuesday it’s broadening its testing for H5N1 to include about 155 additional samples of dairy products, including aged raw milk cheese, cream cheese, butter and ice cream. The FDA has repeatedly tested pasteurized milk from store shelves in the months since the first dairy cattle herd tested positive for H5N1 and has continuously emphasized the nation’s milk supply remains safe. “This retail sampling effort is intended to address remaining geographic and product gaps from the initial sampling of the commercial milk supply that FDA conducted between April and May of this year,” said Don Prater, acting director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the FDA. It will likely take several weeks before those results are completed and made public, he said. That second round of expanded food safety testing will not include raw milk, since it is not approved for interstate commerce, he said. But the FDA has sent a letter to its local, state and tribal partners, cautioning those that do allow the sale of raw milk to talk with consumers about the additional risks, given that H5N1 is spreading through dairy herds in several parts of the country. Prater, speaking on the call Tuesday, noted the FDA continues to strongly advise against drinking raw milk. “We also recommend that the industry does not manufacture or sell raw milk or raw milk products, including raw milk cheese made with milk from cows showing symptoms of illness, including those infected with the avian influenza viruses or exposed to those infected with avian influenza viruses.” Source New Mexico is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

This comes after the Nordic country culled approximately 485,000 animals to control the virus outbreak on minx and fox fur farms last yearread moreAdvertisementFinland will become world's first country to commence bird flu vaccinations in humans. Image for Representation. ReutersIn a world first, Finland is set to roll out bird flu vaccinations for humans next week, targeting workers who are most exposed to animals. This proactive measure involves vaccinating 10,000 individuals, each receiving two doses, as part of a broader EU effort that includes up to 40 million doses across 15 countries.CSL Seqirus, the Australian pharmaceutical company behind the vaccines, confirmed to Reuters that Finland will be the first to launch this vaccination strategy. “The vaccine will be offered to those aged 18 or over who are at increased risk of contracting avian influenza due to their work or other circumstances,” announced the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL).AdvertisementAlthough the Nordic country has not yet detected any human cases of the virus, this preemptive approach is part of the country’s efforts to safeguard its population and mitigate bird flu risks, especially from its fur farms.From birds to cattle to humansBird flu, formally known as avian influenza, encompasses various influenza type A viruses that primarily affect birds but can also infect non-avian species, including humans.Among the many strains, H5N1 is a significant one that has been circulating among wild birds worldwide.Birds transmit the virus through their saliva, mucus, and faeces, posing a risk to people and animals in close, unprotected contact with infected birds or contaminated environments.In a surprising development in March, H5N1 strain rapidly spread through dairy cow herds in the United States, and was described by the CDC as an “ongoing multi-state outbreak.” The US Department of Agriculture reported infections in 101 dairy herds across 12 states, with several cases also found in dairy workers.Dairy cow herds in multiple US states had tested positive for bird flu. Image for Representation. APThis transmission to cattle surprised scientists, who previously believed cows were not susceptible to the virus.Beyond cattle, the H5N1 outbreak also severely impacted poultry. According to the CDC, over 97 million poultry have been affected by the virus as of June 20, causing widespread devastation in the industry.How prevalent is bird flu in humans?AdvertisementThere have been cases of humans catching H5N1 from time to time in several countries, including Cambodia, Chile, China, Vietnam, Australia, US, and the UK.Earlier this year, when H5N1 spread to US cow herds, several dairy workers were found infected, though their symptoms were mild.There is no evidence it virus can morph into a form that would pose a big threat to humans, however, two eminent flu experts warned in an article in the British Medical Journal: ’the hazard and risk of a major outbreak of H5N1 are large, plausible and imminent.’ Image for Representation. APGenerally, humans contract bird flu through direct contact with infected animals or their byproducts, such as carcasses, saliva, or faeces. The virus is also airborne, meaning inhaling near an infected animal can lead to infection.A notable case surfaced in May involved a 59-year-old man in Mexico who died from H5N2, a bird flu strain never before recorded in humans. The source of his infection remains unclear. Professor Sir Peter Horby, director of the Pandemic Sciences Institute at the University of Oxford, told the BBC, “This case is one more in a series of developments that collectively could be considered a red flag.”AdvertisementAlthough there’s no evidence it virus can morph into a form that would pose a big threat to humans, two eminent flu experts warned in an article in the British Medical Journal: “the hazard and risk of a major outbreak of H5N1 are large, plausible and imminent.”Finland’s preemptive strikeLast year, Finland experienced significant bird flu outbreaks on mink and fox fur farms, particularly those that are open-air. These outbreaks led to the culling of approximately 485,000 animals to control the virus. The virus also caused the deaths of thousands of seagulls and other bird species, threatened livestock, and resulted in travel restrictions in some areas.Advertisement“Mink is an especially problematic species when it comes to avian influenza infections,” a THL representative told Reuters, noting that mink can serve as an effective intermediate host, allowing the virus to mutate into forms more likely to infect humans.Finnish authorities have identified several high-risk groups for vaccination: workers at fur and poultry farms, lab technicians handling bird flu samples, veterinarians working as animal control officers in fur farm regions, and people working in sanctuaries, livestock farms, or processing plants for animal by-products.Vaccinations are expected to begin as early as next week in parts of the country. A THL spokesperson mentioned to Reuters that if a human infection of bird flu occurs, close contacts of suspected or confirmed cases will also be offered the vaccine.AdvertisementWith input from agenciesTagsBird fluRead MoreFind us on YouTubeSubscribeRelated StoriesWhy Australia bird flu outbreak is forcing McDonaldâs lovers to make big sacrificeTop virologist explains: Can bird flu among humans become like Covid or long Covid?Human case of bird flu detected in India: Should we be worried?First since 2019, WHO confirms human case of bird flu in IndiaWhy Australia bird flu outbreak is forcing McDonaldâs lovers to make big sacrificeTop virologist explains: Can bird flu among humans become like Covid or long Covid?Human case of bird flu detected in India: Should we be worried?First since 2019, WHO confirms human case of bird flu in IndiaTop Shows About FirstpostMost Searched CategoriesWeb StoriesWorldIndiaExplainersOpinionSportsCricketTech/AutoEntertainmentIPL 2024NETWORK18 SITESNews18Money ControlCNBC TV18Forbes IndiaSitemap is on YouTubeSubscribe NowCopyright @ 2024.

A highly infectious type of avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, has shown concerning zoonotic transmission in recent weeks. The outbreak, which has reportedly affected a few human lives and has spread to four humans so far, is rapidly expanding in the U.S. Previously limited to wild birds and domestic poultry, the virus has been detected in cats across 31 states, with isolated cases identified in dogs. This raises concerns for both animal health and potential human exposure, particularly among pet owners. Here’s everything you need to know. Bird flu spreads to cats and dogs as infections jump to mammals in 31 states: Here’s what to know(Photo by Andrew S on Unsplash) Bird flu spreads across 31 states in the USAccording to USA Today, the infection has spread from cows to mice, foxes, mountain lions, and even alpacas in 12 states so far. Despite initial expert assurances that the virus would not affect dairy products, it has rapidly spread among dairy cows nationwide, affecting over 90 herds in the past few months. The H5N1 virus has also caused collateral harm in a variety of other species, including poultry, dairy, and three farm workers who were exposed to the disease. Nonetheless, the real worry appears to be escalating as sporadic instances of the infection have been found in cats and dogs.

According to the report, while the infections were spreading at dairy farms, a few sick and dead cats showed symptoms of illness, which went unnoticed. Researchers have long been aware that felines are at risk of contracting avian influenza. "Domestic cats are actually highly susceptible to avian influenza, especially H5N1," said Kristen Coleman, a researcher at the University of Maryland as per the NY Times.

There are a few reports of dogs as well, although the number is lower, the concern looms. H5N1, a new version of bird flu that emerged back in 2020, has rapidly spread globally. Scientists believe that while cases in cats and dogs remain rare, "it results in very severe illness and oftentimes death," which is why it should be taken seriously. Could Bird flu spread from pet cats to humanThere is a slight risk of humans falling ill if their pets are infected, though the likelihood is very low according to the CDC. Professionals believe that the H5N1 virus could be transmitted through a cat's spit, poop, or other body fluids. A lot of cats with the virus show signs of fever, reduced hunger, and lung problems like runny nose, trouble breathing, and pneumonia. They might also have neurological signs like rigidity, shaking, and seizures often. "We do not fully understand whether or not they are capable of transmitting," Dr. Johnson said, addressing whether cats can transmit the disease to humans. "There is currently no evidence that cats have been contributing to the spread of the virus on dairy farms," she added. Read breaking news, latest...

James Nason 27/06/2024 With avian influenza spreading to a 10th Australian poultry facility, following on from reports of bird flu jumping from poultry to cattle in the US earlier this year, are Australian cattle now also at risk? It is a question being raised more earnestly as Australia deals with three parallel outbreaks of bird flu, two near Melbourne and one near Sydney. The flu has mostly hit egg farms. Around 1.5 million birds have been or will be killed to control the spread of the virus. Disease experts have told Beef Central this week that while the transmission of the disease from poultry to cattle here is “not impossible”, such a cross over is “highly unlikely”. The Australian outbreaks are not caused by or related to the H5N1 strain of avian influenza causing mass animal deaths overseas and the strain reported to infect dairy cattle in the United States, Dr Frank Wong, bird flu expert at CSIRO’s Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness explained. Dr José Quinteros, a lecturer in Poultry Health in the Sydney University’s School of Veterinary Science, said transmission to cattle in Australia was very unlikely because the pathogenic avian flu infecting poultry here is a different strain to what is in the US. “It is not impossible – I would never say impossible – but most definitely very unlikely.” Dr Quinteros added that there is ongoing concern over the emergence of virulent bird flu strains and their transmission across farms and states in Australia because it might be exacerbated by the presence of free-range operations, facilitating the interaction between wild avifauna and domestic poultry. “This will require ongoing observation and management.” Dr Frank Wong from CSIRO’s Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness said testing by the centre has shown the current Australian outbreaks of avian influenza are caused by three separate strains in the H7 family: the H7N3 strain at seven properties in the Meredith area of Victoria the H7N9 strain at one property in the Terang region of Victoria the H7N8 strain at two properties in the Hawkesbury district in NSW. “By comparing the genetic codes of these viruses, scientists can see they are not closely related, but are more closely related to low pathogenic strains known to be carried by Australian wild birds,” Dr Wong said. “This leads us to believe each outbreak is likely to have separately originated in wild birds as low pathogenic bird flu, spilled over into poultry, then mutated into these highly pathogenic viruses. “The Australian H7 outbreaks are not caused by or related to the H5N1 strain of avian influenza. H5N1 is the high pathogenic avian influenza strain causing mass animal deaths overseas, and is the strain reported to infect dairy cattle in the United States. “The H5N1 virus affecting cattle remains confined to the USA and has not been reported in birds or livestock animals anywhere else outside of the USA. “On the other hand, the H7 viruses causing HPAI outbreaks in Australia remain bird-adapted viruses known only to infect farmed poultry. H7 avian influenza viruses have never been reported to cause infection in cattle or other livestock anywhere in the world including in Australia. “So the risk of possible transmission from infected birds in Australia’s current bird flu outbreaks into cattle is considered to be low. “The government is conducting enhanced surveillance monitoring of wild bird populations in Australia. This is important for both the existing outbreaks and to help us be informed and prepared for potential future outbreaks. The bird flu virus, which was first reported in US poultry farms in 14 states in early 2022, has spread to cows and two humans in the first-ever cases of bird flu in humans in the United States. The same subtype of bird flu is also spreading in other countries, in what experts are calling a “global pandemic for animals”. US public health officials have been monitoring dairy cow herds, as well as beef and milk products around the country since the first outbreak in cows was reported in March. So far, the US is the only country to have reported bird flu in cattle. HAVE YOUR SAY Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

The risk of transmission to humans remains low and commercially sold milk and milk products remain safe, according to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.But an outbreak that began with reports of sick cows — and dead wild birds — on dairy farms in Kansas and Texas in March has now spread to 131 herds across a dozen American states. Three human cases (one in Texas, two in Michigan, all with mild symptoms) have been linked with the ongoing outbreak in U.S. dairy cows.NP PostedGet a dash of perspective along with the trending news of the day in a very readable format.There was an error, please provide a valid email address.Sign UpBy signing up you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia Network Inc.Thanks for signing up!A welcome email is on its way.

What has scientists unnerved is that H5N1 is mutating to more easily infect mammals. “I’m very worried about pigs,” Miller said. Pigs can act as mixing vessels, allowing bird flu to swap genetic material with human flu viruses, making it much better adapted to transmit in humans.Finland is set next week to become the globe’s first nation to start administering bird flu vaccines, beginning with farm workers.How worried should people be? Here’s what we know about the H5N1 virus and its potential threat to humans.H5N1 isn’t newH5N1 was first detected in birds in 1996, in southern China and Hong Kong. Since then, it has become endemic in bird populations, wiping out millions of wild and farmed birds. H5N1 has infected at least 889 people since 2003, killing a high proportion (52 per cent) of those it infects.People mostly get infected after contact with a live or dead infected animal’s bodily fluids, like saliva, blood or feces.Human-to-human transmission of H5N1 is rare. But the high ratio of deaths to cases suggests bird flu “could cause a major public health emergency if human exposure and viral evolution lead to sustained person-to-person transmission,” according to an editorial published in the BMJ.Advertisement 4Story continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article contentWhat can H5N1 do to humans?Seasonal flu is generally restricted to our lungs. It particularly likes our upper airways, Miller said, which is good, because lower lung infections tend to lead to more severe infections, like pneumonia.But H5N1 doesn’t linger in the lungs. The host factors it relies on to replicate in cells are found in almost all human tissues, Miller said. “It can infect all kinds of other organs, including our brain.” Humans infected by H5N1 have developed complications ranging from encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) to coma.The case fatality rate (the proportion of people with confirmed infections who die) has exceeded 50 per cent, but infections are likely being missed, if people had no, or unremarkable symptoms. The true death rate is likely lower. One estimate by scientists at the Public Health Agency of Canada put the infection fatality rate closer to 14 to 33 per cent, which would still present “a truly dreadful scenario” in the event of a pandemic with sustained person-to-person transmission, the researchers said.Critical illness is higher in children and young adults.Advertisement 5Story continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content“A concerted and dedicated effort by the international community to avert a pandemic through combating avian influenza in animals and humans in affected countries needs to be a global priority,” the authors wrote in 2008.How much would H5N1 have to change to trigger a human pandemic?It’s still unclear how the first cows in Texas got sick. But cows are likely being infected via contaminated milking machinery, not passing the virus through airborne droplets from cow to cow, virologist Dr. Thomas Peacock told the BBC.“A full set of adaptions” would be needed for human-to-human, airborne transmission, the British researchers wrote in the British Medical Journal. But as the virus spills from birds to more and more mammal species, including, sporadically in Canada, racoons, striped skunks, red foxes, cats and dogs, “people are exposed more than ever, providing a human land of opportunity for viral mutation and recombination.”“There are two ways the virus can learn to transmit in humans,” said Miller, scientific director of the Michael G. DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research at McMaster University in Hamilton.Advertisement 6Story continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content“It adapts by itself, which I would call the slow, and probably less risky road.” The “high-risk super highway” would be for the virus to recombine with a human virus, “or some other mammalian virus that’s better suited to human transmission.”What happens if an H5N1 infected milk sample is found in Canada?“Then we’re in trouble,” Miller said. “Because if we find an infected milk sample, then the virus is almost certainly pretty widespread, because we know how rapidly the virus can spread via contaminated milking equipment.”“The CFIA (Canadian Food Inspection Agency) is taking an approach to testing commercial milk that gives them some insight into where the milk comes from,” Miller said. “Intuitively what they would do is start looking back at the farms that were the supplier of the milk that tested positive in order to identify infected animals.”CFIA has also put in place mandatory testing measures for cows coming in from the U.S.What about H5N1 vaccines?Commercial H5N1 vaccines are available, though there is no avian influenza vaccine currently available in Canada for public use, according to Health Canada’s website. The U.S. has stockpiled H5N1 vaccines, and other countries are soliciting tenders for emergency doses. “I’m not aware that Canada has done that yet but quite certain that it is being considered at this point,” Miller said. Canada has procurement contracts in place with manufacturers that make H5N1 vaccines.Advertisement 7Story continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content“I’m acutely aware of public sentiment around vaccines right now, and resistance to vaccination,” Miller said. But the H5N1 vaccines use the same technologies used to make seasonal flu shots, which are updated every year to match the circulating viruses.The risk to humans isn’t high enough to justify a mass H5N1 vaccination campaign. “My preference is that we don’t find ourselves in that scenario,” Miller said.“The best thing we could do is adopt a strategy like Finland is using and offer vaccine to those at high occupational exposure risk to prevent a widespread human outbreak.”National PostRecommended from Editorial There's a bird flu outbreak.

By M. Sai Gopal Updated On - 27 June 2024, 07:05 PM Representational Image Hyderabad: A significant flare-up of infections related to seasonal flu, influenza, viral infections is being reported by doctors, immunologists and public health specialists in Hyderabad. The rise of infections in the last week or so could be a clear indication of an unknown infection of viral origin, which is circulating among the community in Hyderabad, they point out. Also Read Nalgonda: Officials on alert after spurt in viral fever cases There is a fear among caregivers that the present rise of viral infections in Hyderabad could end-up being a precursor for a significant wave of upper respiratory infections like severe pneumonia, wherein lungs get infected, in the coming days. An outbreak of influenza should not surprise anyone because last year (March, 2023) Hyderabad had witnessed a significant surge of infections among people due to influenza A (H1N1) and another subtype A (H3N2) cases, which were later confirmed by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) surveillance data. Typically, these days, hospitals in Hyderabad are receiving patients with symptoms of seasonal flu and within days, in some patients, the infection is spreading to upper respiratory tract and even to the lower respiratory tract, thus infecting lungs. There is a trend of rise in consumption and prescribing of anti-viral drug Oseltamivir, which is retailed under the brand name Tamiflu, for treatment of patients in Hyderabad. The administration of Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is an indication that some flu positive patients, probably those with comorbid conditions, are facing severe symptoms, doctors here pointed out. “We are witnessing extreme flare-ups of infections in the last ten days in Hyderabad. Due to immunological changes among a large section of population during the Covid pandemic, even a simple flu is now getting intensified into upper and lower respiratory tract infections among individuals. I am hoping that this sudden rise in infections does not lead to a major surge of pneumonia or viral infections,” says senior immunologist from Hyderabad, Dr Vyakaranam Nageshwar. Senior doctors at the nodal government-health care facility for seasonal ailments, Fever Hospital, Nallakunta, however, have said that they are yet to witness a major rise in viral infections. “At present, we are witnessing a few cases of seasonal flu, which is normal because of weather changes, and a few sporadic cases of dengue. So far, we have not been able to witness any kind of trend that indicates major flare-up pneumonia-like cases. For an average person on the street, it is always better to keep taking precautions by leading a healthy and active life,” says Superintendent, Fever Hospitals, Dr K Shankar. Doctors point out that inclement weather conditions are ideal for causing viral and bacterial infections and taking precautions is the best foot forward. Government Advisory: If you have developed flu like symptoms i.e. cough with fever, headache, sore throat and associated body pains or conjunctivitis, reach nearby Government health facilities. Consult a doctor immediately if fever persists for more than 3 days. Symptoms of Flu: Fever, sneezing, runny nose, nasal congestion, cough, wheezing and often chest congestion. Body pains, lethargy, difficulty in breathing could cause oxygen saturation.

Read this article to know precautionary measures to avoid it.Written by: Manali MomayaUpdated at: Jun 27, 2024 16:25 ISTSHAREFOLLOWA rise in viral flu cases have been reported in Mumbai as monsoon season hits the economic capital of India, most common being dengue and swine flu. Healthcare experts are alarmed by the growing number of patients presenting with symptoms such as high-grade fever and severe throat pain. Doctors are advising the public to take essential precautions to curb the spread of these seasonal infections. To understand what kinds of cases are common and how to take precautionary measures, OnlyMyHealth team interacted with Dr Neeraj Kumar Tulara, General Medicine and Infectious disease specialist, Dr LH Hiranandani Hospital, Powai, Mumbai. Rising Flu Cases In Mumbai When asked what type of flu cases are frequent, Dr Tulara said, “At the moment, our hospital is recording outbreaks of the flu, a situation attributable to influenza seasonality. Stress has been established in presenting the most frequent strains, which include Influenza A, (H1N1 & H3N2) and Influenza B, likewise, the flu-like semi viral respiratory infections are on the rise.” Talking about what common symptoms are being seen amongst people these days, he said, “During monsoon people are generally having high fever, body pains, headache, throat and chest pains, running or blocked nose, coughing, and usually are feeling very tired. Patients also experience different side effects located in the gastrointestinal tract such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.” Dengue, malaria, and swine flu are quite regular during this time of the year. Talking about the currently registered cases alone at Hiranandani Hospital, Dr Tulara said, “The dengue cases have been reported as 30 and malaria as 15, and swine flu cases as 20 this week in our hospital. These diseases, normally, show increasing tendency during this time due to the high breeding of mosquitoes and change of weather.” Also read: Cholera Outbreak In Pune: Tips To Prevent Cholera In Monsoon Why The Surge In Mumbai? The surge in flu cases in Mumbai can be attributed to several factors: During the monsoon season which is more specifically characterised by high humidity and varying temperatures, viruses have all the favourable conditions. According to Dr Tulara, rainwater leads to accumulation of water in areas with poor water-drainage systems hence acting as breeding grounds for mosquitoes hence resulting in diseases such as dengue and malaria. “The fact that there might be a constant change of weather conditions the immune system is likely to get weakened,” he added. Management And Precautionary Measures If you are caught with the flu, it is essential to manage your health with the following measures listed by Dr Tulara: Rest: It is important to take adequate rest to enable the body to combat the infection. Hydration: Increase your intake of water, herbal teas, and clear broths to ensure that you maintain adequate water intake throughout the day. Medication: The infected individual should try taking other drugs which are obtainable over the counter on self treatment in order to get rid of some symptoms which include fever and body aches. If you are experiencing signs of an outbreak, seek advice from your doctor regarding antiviral drugs. Nutrition: Take your vitamins and make sure you take lots of fruits and vegetables to increase a healthy immunity towards the flu. Hygiene: Ensure that you take your regular hand wash and when that is not possible use hand sanitizer to clean your hands. Isolation: Do not go out of the house and avoid people and crowded places to avoid spreading of the flu. Also read: How Long After A Mosquito Bite Can You Develop Dengue? Preventive Measures To avoid viral flu, the following preventive measures are recommended:To avoid viral flu, Dr Tulara recommended the following preventive measures: Vaccination: Obtain the annual flu shot for common strains to prevent. Hand Hygiene: Before eating or handling your face, make it a habit to be washing your hands with soap and water. Avoid Crowds: Avoid proximity with many people as much as possible especially during flu season. Healthy Lifestyle: Eat a healthy diet; balance your meals by including fruits, vegetables, lean protein, whole grains, and engage in regular exercises, and ensure you get enough quality sleep as this will help you build strong immune system. Face Masks: Cover your face in crowded areas or if you around a sick individual or displaying symptoms of the virus. Clean Environment: Frequently touched objects such as door handles, stairs, lift buttons among others should often be disinfected at home as well as in offices.

We are encouraging people to continue enjoying their favourite Pace Farm eggs," the company said on Monday.Contact tracing efforts established a direct link between an infected property in NSW with the egg-grading facility in the ACT.Confirmation bird flu was present in the ACT was received by the territory government on Thursday morning.Environment Minister Rebecca Vassarotti said the affected property had been fully contained and biosecurity measures were in place."We are confident that we have acted quickly to contain the affected site with a low risk of spread to other poultry in the ACT from this site," Ms Vassarotti said.Chickens will be killed in order to contain a bird flu outbreak in the ACT. File picture by Katie McDougall"However, the fact that is has now appeared across three jurisdictions is a timely reminder of biosecurity incidents and it should prompt all poultry owners to continue to follow biosecurity measures."No live and infected chickens had been brought into the ACT, however, avian influenza can be transported on other equipment, including trays, trucks and egg cartons.The egg-grading facility is understood to have good biosecurity procedures in place and has been made biosecure for several days.Ms Vassarotti said the site was cooperating with the ACT government to respond to the outbreak.The government would not name the site due to national biosecurity response standards and to avoid adding stress to the business, she said.Environment Minister Rebecca Vassarotti addressing a press conference about avian influenza at the Legislative Assembly on Thursday. Picture by Elesa Kurtz"Given there's no risk to Canberra at this stage, there's not really any utility in naming the facility publicly," Ms Vassarotti said."Our priority now is working with the impacted business and really focusing on animal welfare and support for the staff."Biosecurity officials are currently assessing the number of birds that will need to be killed under agreed national plans for the management of bird flu outbreaks.The ACT government received information on Tuesday morning the premises contained animals that could be infected with influenza.Test results were later confirmed at the Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness laboratories, run by the CSIRO in Geelong.ACT health authorities believe there is a low risk to human health, with no reports of current human avian influenza cases in the territory.People potentially directly exposed to avian influenza at the ACT property will be contacted directly by ACT Health.Poultry owners have been encouraged to be aware of the risk of avian influenza and ensure they follow good biosecurity practices, including preventing their poultry from having contact with wild birds.ShareFacebookTwitterWhatsappEmailCopyJasper LindellAssembly ReporterJasper Lindell joined The Canberra Times in 2018.

Facebook X LinkedIn Copy to Clipboard Copy Victoria Victoria sends state-of-the-art response trucks for avian influenza outbreak Two mobile incident command centres have been deployed by the state government as part of its response to the outbreak of avian influenza. Melissa Coade 28 June, 2024 Share Victorian Agriculture Minister Ros Spence. (AAP Image/Con Chronis) Two mobile incident command centres have been deployed by the state government to Meredith as part of its response to the outbreak of avian influenza. The refurbished SES trucks have been equipped with satellite access and AV equipment to enable response teams for outbreaks on the ground and access key facilities. Named after former animal health officers Aileen Eccles and Alan Ross, the truck refurbishments were completed by local emergency response vehicle design and manufacturing company R.A Bell, in Sunshine. In a statement, Victorian Agriculture Minister Ros Spence said the first truck had been operating from Meredith since May, when the outbreak began, and the second truck was now complete and due to arrive in Meredith this week. “Biosecurity emergencies can happen in any corner of our state and these new mobile incident command centres are key to ensuring we can get our expertise on the ground as quickly and efficiently as possible,” Spence said. The first meeting of Agriculture Victoria’s biosecurity reference group was held in Attwood on Thursday, where the minister launched the mobile command centres. At that meeting, the 15-member expert group discussed the state’s biosecurity risks and challenges, including the current outbreak. “The biosecurity reference group will be able to draw on their industry connections and diverse expertise to ensure that biosecurity actions and activities delivered across Victoria will be meaningful and relevant situations we face,” she said, adding members represent all areas of the biosecurity system, including Traditional Owners, agricultural sector, supply chains, community and environment. Chair Dr Katherine Clift said the reference group had undertaken significant work since it was established in 2022. “Victoria’s biosecurity reference group has been critical in ensuring industry and community views remain central to how biosecurity programs and activities are delivered in our state,” she said. The state government has invested $43 million since 2022 in dedicated emergency animal disease (EAD) preparedness resources including $12.9 million from the 2024 Victorian budget for EAD preparedness, coordination, waste disposal, technical and specialist capability, surge workforce readiness, and traceability systems.

This catastrophe sent shockwaves throughout the poultry industry, affecting all producers.The outbreak and subsequent culling efforts have had profound implications, not just for the industry's economic health but also for the country's food security.The impact of this outbreak was severe. The culling of nearly 10 million chickens, necessitated by the outbreak, placed a significant financial burden on producers. Despite these challenges, the resilience of South African poultry producers shone through as they managed to avert a shortage in the chicken supply. However, concerns remain high regarding the potential for another outbreak, especially in the absence of a robust vaccination programme.South Africa faces a unique challenge with bird flu due to its particular strain, H7, which accounted for over 80% of last year’s chicken deaths. Unlike the internationally prevalent H5 strain, which has an approved vaccine, the H7 strain still lacks a vaccine. This gap leaves the industry vulnerable to future outbreaks.The government's stringent requirements for vaccination present additional hurdles. Producers need government-issued permits to vaccinate their flocks, which involves navigating a complex and rigorous approval process. This bureaucratic red tape, coupled with the high costs of biosecurity measures and subsequent testing programmes, has led to calls for intervention from key stakeholders.Fair Play, an advocacy group, has urged former Agriculture Minister and current Speaker of Parliament, Thoko Didiza, to streamline the vaccination approval process. Chicken farmers may fear reporting #birdflu cases due to lack of compensation for culled birds. South Africa has to catch up to the rest of the world and follow best practice - compensate farmers!https:/.co/PZNLgJmZjX— FairPlay (@FairPlayZA) June 18, 2024“We understand that the government thinks certain processes must be followed strictly, but we also think that the biosecurity measures required to be administered before vaccinations, however rigorous and expensive, are essential. Making it too complicated and burdensome will hinder vaccination efforts,” Francois Baird, the founder of Fair Play, stated.The poultry industry warns that without a comprehensive vaccination programme, the sector faces another potential disaster. South Africa’s poultry industry is among the most competitive globally, consistently ranking in the top five or six for efficiency. However, continued government withholding of compensation for culling could undermine this resilience. Smaller farmers particularly, who might be reluctant to cull infected flocks without compensation, could exacerbate the spread of bird flu.Financial compensation remains a critical issue. Despite policies that provide for compensation, the actual process is fraught with difficulties. Farmers often find their culled chickens are deemed ineligible for compensation, leaving them with substantial losses. A more effective and reliable compensation policy is urgently needed to support farmers in managing outbreaks and maintaining industry stability. ‘Recent arrests of chicken smugglers highlight the need for better regulation’“There’s a bizarre situation at the moment where the government’s policy makes provision for compensation, but when farmers apply, the chickens that have been culled are regarded as null and void, and therefore they don’t get compensated,” Baird highlighted.Additionally, the industry requires greater government support to boost exports and protect against unfair trade practices. Recent arrests of chicken smugglers highlight the need for better regulation and enforcement to safeguard the local industry from illegal imports. "We need to better protect what comes into South Africa against what comes in egregiously,” Baird emphasised.Thoko Didiza, Minister of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development, said her department will be more efficient at issuing import permits for egg products as the highly contagious avian influenza causes egg shortages in northern South Africa.READ: https:/.co/di3p561Cku pic.twitter.com/NBWMFMQNUp— African Farming (@africanfarming_) October 4, 2023Looking ahead, it is crucial for the government to revise its approach to vaccination, increase the number of state veterinarians, and foster closer cooperation with the poultry industry. Effective compensation mechanisms must be implemented, and supportive measures must be put in place to enhance the industry's resilience and ensure the availability of affordable chicken for South African consumers.The future of South Africa's poultry industry hinges on addressing these challenges decisively. By implementing a comprehensive vaccination programme, providing adequate compensation, and enhancing regulatory measures, the industry can protect itself from future outbreaks and continue to thrive as a cornerstone of the national economy. "If we want cheaper chicken in South Africa, which is what everyone wants, vaccination is vital for the future," Baird concluded.OFM Agri/Robyn Schutte cg More from News 08 Nov 2024 Goeie reën voorspel vir somerreënvalgebiede 07 Nov 2024 Noord-Kaapse droogte: Kenhardt-boere se pleidooi You May be Interested in 07 Nov 2024 Landboumasjinerie-verkope daal in Oktober, boere wag op reën 04 Nov 2024 Verskillende subklasse vir boerderybedrywighede: Wat jy moet weet 04 Nov 2024 RMIS begin fase 1 van naspeurbaarheidsplatform View All International Ingryping dringend in Mosambiek geëis Burgerlike samelewingsgroepe doen ’n beroep op die Suider-Afrikaanse Ontwikkelingsgemeenskap (SAOG) om in Mosambiek in te gryp.

You may or may not be aware that influenza is far more than just a seasonal inconvenience — it is a serious illness that goes beyond the common flu Image via Freepik For older adults, it can be deadly. As we age, our immune systems weaken, making us more susceptible to serious complications from influenza. Unlike younger, healthier individuals, older adults might not show just typical flu symptoms. Instead, they could experience a decline in overall health or an increased risk of falls.Recently, the Ministry of Health announced that starting 2025, older adults in Malaysia will receive free annual flu shots under the National Immunisation Programme. This move comes after a vigorous campaign by the Malaysian Influenza Working Group (MIWG) and partner organisations, highlighting the critical need to protect our senior citizens from the severe impacts of influenza. To put things in perspective, a single case of influenza among the elderly can increase their risk of a heart attack by 10 times and a stroke by eight times¹ Image via suphaporn/Freepik Older individuals are also at higher risk for complications like pneumonia, heart inflammation, and sepsis. Alarmingly, up to 70% of influenza-related hospitalisations and 85% of influenza-related deaths occur in those aged 65 and above.² ³﻿For older adults with preexisting conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, or pulmonary disease, the risks are even higher. The presence of more than one non-communicable disease (NCD) can increase the risk of influenza-related death by up to 20 times.⁴ Countries like Thailand, Laos, the Philippines, and Singapore have already implemented free influenza vaccination programmes for their elderly populations Image via Mufid Majnun/Unsplash While we eagerly anticipate similar measures in Malaysia, I urge everyone to take proactive steps now. The influenza virus circulates year-round in tropical climates like ours, and Southeast Asia ranks third in influenza-related deaths. Yet, only 2-3% of Malaysians are vaccinated against influenza.⁵﻿The influenza vaccine has been available since 1945, with extensive research supporting its safety. Getting vaccinated not only protects individuals but also helps reduce the burden on our healthcare system. Despite its benefits, a recent IPSOS survey revealed that many older Malaysians hold misconceptions about the influenza vaccine Image via tirachardz/Freepik For instance, 52% believe influenza is only a concern in cold climates. And although 70% know it can be prevented through vaccination, 64% worry about serious side effects. Additionally, 69% think they are already protected by the COVID-19 vaccine.As Malaysia heads towards becoming an aged nation by 2030, with 15.3% of the population being 60 years old and above, we cannot ignore the public health implications of influenza. Intensive educational campaigns are essential to address misconceptions and encourage vaccination. It's crucial for all stakeholders, including the government, healthcare professionals, and communities, to work together to raise awareness and promote action Image via Freepik As healthcare frontliners, we see the devastating effects of influenza on older adults daily. I call on my fellow healthcare professionals to advocate for yearly influenza vaccinations and educate our communities.Together, we can protect our loved ones and ourselves from the severe impacts of influenza.﻿ This story is a personal opinion of the writer and does not necessarily reflect the position of SAYS.
