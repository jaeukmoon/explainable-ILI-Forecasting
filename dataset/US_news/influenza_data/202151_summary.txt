- Broadly neutralizing antibodies that target a haemagglutinin anchor epitope have been identified
- These antibodies have the potential to provide near universal protection against influenza virus infection
- The antibodies are able to neutralize viral escape mutants
- They target a discrete membrane-proximal anchor epitope of the haemagglutinin stalk domain
- The antibodies are broadly neutralizing across H1 viruses and can cross-react with H2 and H5 viruses
- Anchor epitope-targeting B cells are common in the human memory B cell repertoire
- The antibodies were recalled in humans by an oil-in-water adjuvanted chimeric haemagglutinin vaccine, which is a potential universal influenza virus vaccine
- Boosting the production of these broadly neutralizing antibodies through vaccination could maximize protection against seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses.
