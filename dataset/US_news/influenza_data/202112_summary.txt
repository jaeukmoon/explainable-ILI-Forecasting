- Researchers have developed a nanoparticle influenza vaccine that induces broad protection against various viral strains.
- The vaccine contains 20 haemagglutinin glycoprotein trimers arranged in an ordered array.
- The nanoparticle vaccine elicited potent neutralizing antibody responses against vaccine-matched strains and simultaneously induced broadly protective antibody responses to heterologous viruses.
- The vaccine targets the subdominant yet conserved haemagglutinin stem, which allows for cross-reactivity and protection against different influenza strains.
- This vaccine has the potential to replace conventional seasonal vaccines and provide supraseasonal protection against influenza.
