- The influenza virus is a global threat to human health, with recurring pandemics emerging over the past hundred years.
- The World Health Organization (WHO) established a global influenza surveillance network in the 1950s, which monitors circulating influenza strains in humans and animal reservoirs.
- The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the WHO have developed pandemic risk assessment tools to evaluate emerging influenza strains and determine research and funding priorities.
- Influenza A and B viruses are responsible for annual epidemics, and influenza A viruses have caused four pandemics since 1918.
- Aquatic avian species serve as the natural reservoir of influenza A viruses, which can adapt to infect other animals and transmit to humans through genetic reassortment.
- The 2009 H1N1 pandemic demonstrated the unpredictability of influenza pandemics and the need for comprehensive frameworks to evaluate strains and assess public health risks.
- The WHO and CDC have scoring systems to evaluate prepandemic influenza viruses based on virus properties, human population attributes, and virological markers.
- Continuous evaluation and revision of risk assessment and pandemic preparedness plans, as well as incorporating new research and information, are essential.
