Pandemics happen when new (novel) influenza A viruses emerge which are able to infect people easily and spread from person to person in an efficient and sustained way. Pandemic Basics Because the virus is new to humans, very few people will have immunity against the pandemic virus, and a vaccine might not be widely available. The new virus will make a lot of people sick. How sick people get will depend on the characteristics of the virus, whether or not people have any immunity to that virus, and the health and age of the person being infected. With seasonal flu, for example, certain chronic health conditions are known to make those people more susceptible to serious flu infections. The risk factors associated with seasonal flu can be found at "People at High Risk of Developing Flu–Related Complications." Influenza pandemics are uncommon; only occurred during the 20th century. Seasonal Flu Pandemic Flu How often does it happen? Happens annually and usually peaks between December and February Rarely happens (three times in 20th century) Will most people be immune? Usually some immunity from previous exposures and influenza vaccination Most people have little or no immunity because they have no previous exposure to the virus or similar viruses Who is at risk for complications? Certain people are at high-risk for serious complications (infants, elderly, pregnant women, extreme obesity and persons with certain chronic medical conditions) Healthy people also may be at high risk for serious complications Where can I get medical care? Health care providers and hospitals can usually meet public and patient needs Health care providers and hospitals may be overwhelmed Alternate care sites may be available to meet public and patient needs Will a vaccine be available? Vaccine available for annual flu season Usually, one dose of vaccine is needed for most people Although the US government maintains a limited stockpile of pandemic vaccine, vaccine may not be available in the early stages of a pandemic Two doses of vaccine may be needed Will antivirals be available? Adequate supplies of antivirals are usually available Antiviral supply may not be adequate to meet demand How many people could get sick and suffer complications? Rates of medical visits, complications, hospitalizations and death can vary from low to high CDC estimates that flu-related hospitalizations since 2010 ranged from 140,000 to 710,000, while flu-related deaths are estimated to have ranged from 12,000 to 56,000. Rates of medical visits, complications, hospitalizations and death can range from moderate to high Number of deaths could be much higher than seasonal flu (e.g. The estimated U.S. death toll during the 1918 pandemic was approximately 675,000) What impact will it have on schools and workplaces? Usually causes minor impact on the general public, some schools may close and sick people are encouraged to stay home Manageable impact on domestic and world economies May cause major impact on the general public, such as travel restrictions and school or business closings Potential for severe impact on domestic and world economies Download March 27, 2024 Sources Print Share Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Syndicate Content Source: National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD) Pandemic Flu A flu pandemic is a global outbreak of a new flu A virus.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories has confirmed this detection. Further testing and investigation by state and federal officials have revealed the source of infection. The farm recently received cattle from an affected premises in Texas before that herd showed any sign of disease. When the cattle were moved from Texas to Michigan, the cattle were not symptomatic and did not appear ill. As this national situation continues to develop, it is essential for all producers to contact their veterinarian if they have any concerns regarding the health of their animals, regardless of species. "We have well-trained staff responding to this situation and I have the utmost confidence in our team. We will continue working with our local, state, and national partners to protect animal and public health," said Director Boring. "Our highest priorities at MDARD remain protecting our food supply and ensuring animal health. As this situation evolves, we will provide critical updates to producers, industry, and all Michiganders.” “This case does reflect a lot of what is already known about this virus—namely, that it is highly contagious, it continues to be primarily spread by wild birds and contact with infected animals, and mammals can contract the virus,” said State Veterinarian Dr. Nora Wineland, DVM, MS, DACVPM. “MDARD is working diligently and in close collaboration with government partners, producer groups, and Michigan dairy farmers to address the situation and prevent the spread of disease. As more is learned, it is vitally important for producers to work with their veterinarian and isolate sick animals from others, minimize the number of visitors to their farms, prevent contact between their animals and wildlife, and continue to vigilantly monitor the health of their animals.” HPAI is a highly contagious virus that can be spread directly by infected wild birds/animals or indirectly through any item that has been exposed to the virus—such as equipment, feed, or the clothing and shoes of caretakers. The virus has been detected in various species of mammals—presumably after the animals come into contact with infected birds. To limit the spread of the disease, the affected premises voluntarily stopped movement. Producers who have concerns about the health of their animals and/or questions regarding how to improve the measures they take to protect animal health on their farm should contact their veterinarian. Also, if cattle producers notice decreased lactation, low appetite, and/or other symptoms in their herds, please contact your veterinarian to determine the next appropriate steps to take. Analysis of the virus from this case and the other cases of affected cattle has not shown any significant new adaptation to make the virus more transmissible between mammals. Therefore, the public health risk associated with HPAI remains low. According to the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease and Prevention, the commercial milk supply remains safe due to both federal animal health requirements and pasteurization. If anyone suspects the presence of HPAI or any other reportable animal disease in their domestic animals, please contact MDARD immediately at 800-292-3939 (daytime) or 517-373-0440 (after-hours). For more information on the detections of HPAI in cattle, please visit the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s website. ### Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) Detections in Livestock (USDA.gov) Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Detected in Michigan Dairy Herd (MDARD - YouTube) MI Newswire Department of Agriculture and Rural Development HPAI Alerts Author: Chelsea Lewis-Parisio MDARD Media Contact LewisC31@Michigan.gov 517-331-1151 Jennifer Holton MDARD Media Contact HoltonJ@Michigan.gov 517-284-5724 Sick domestic animal calls 800-292-3939 Related News MI Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development Approve 2025 Generally Accepted Agricultural and Management Practices Gov Whitmer Proclaims November as Michigan Craft Beverage Month to Celebrate Michigan Businesses MDARD, MDHHS, and MDNR Proudly Recognize One Health Day MDARD Announces Request for Joint Evaluation Committee Volunteers for Economic Development Grants Dr Laura Johnson Joins MDARD as Chief Science Officer MDARD Encourages Owners to Help Keep Animals Safe this Halloween State Veterinarian Statement on West Nile Virus-Positive Tuscola County Horse MDARD’s Plant Pathology Laboratory Achieves Nation’s First Core Accreditation from the National Plant Diagnostic Network Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development Announces Specialty Crop Block Grant Public Input Opportunity Governor Whitmer Proclaims October as Michigan Agritourism Month Follow us Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Detected in Michigan Dairy Herd Copyright State of Michigan AboutThe Michigan Department of Agriculture & Rural Development (MDARD) works to assure food safety, protect animal and plant health, sustain environmental stewardship, provide consumer protection, enable rural development and foster efficient administration operations through service, partnership and collaboration.

Here, we investigate the function of the inflammasome-activated, pore-forming protein gasdermin D (GSDMD) during infection. Ablation of GSDMD in knockout (KO) mice (Gsdmd−/−) significantly attenuates influenza virus-induced weight loss, lung dysfunction, lung histopathology, and mortality compared with wild type (WT) mice, despite similar viral loads. Infected Gsdmd−/− mice exhibit decreased inflammatory gene signatures shown by lung transcriptomics. Among these, diminished neutrophil gene activation signatures are corroborated by decreased detection of neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase in KO mouse lungs. Indeed, directly infected neutrophils are observed in vivo and infection of neutrophils in vitro induces release of DNA and tissue-damaging enzymes that is largely dependent on GSDMD. Neutrophil depletion in infected WT mice recapitulates the reductions in mortality, lung inflammation, and lung dysfunction observed in Gsdmd−/− animals, while depletion does not have additive protective effects in Gsdmd−/− mice. These findings implicate a function for GSDMD in promoting lung neutrophil responses that amplify influenza virus-induced inflammation and pathogenesis. Targeting the GSDMDeutrophil axis may provide a therapeutic avenue for treating severe influenza.

Exuberant inflammatory immune responses and tissue damage often characterize severe IAV infections. Indeed, IAV is known to trigger multiple inflammatory pathways, including the activation of cellular inflammasomes through several mechanisms3. However, whether inflammasome activation is beneficial or detrimental to the outcome of viral infections is context dependent4,5,6,7,8,9, which could indicate that distinct pathways and molecules downstream of inflammasome activation have divergent effects.The NLRP3 inflammasome is amongst the best characterized inflammasomes in the context of IAV infection and its activation is a double-edged sword, driving both beneficial effects and pathological inflammation3,6. NLRP3 knockout (KO) mice exhibit accelerated death upon IAV infection, a phenotype that is associated with a decrease in protective proinflammatory cytokine secretion5. On the other hand, blockade of the NLRP3 inflammasome via chemical inhibition at day 7 post infection is beneficial during influenza virus infection and was also correlated with decreased production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines6,10,11,12. In addition, we have previously shown dramatically reduced morbidity, mortality, and lung inflammation in IAV-infected mice treated with an experimental therapeutic protein, recombinant human Mitsugumin 53 (MG53, also known as TRIM7213), which was associated with decreased NLRP3 inflammasome levels and activity14. Together, these prior studies suggest that, while some inflammasome functions may be beneficial, excessive inflammasome activation contributes to pathology and death during IAV infection.Gasdermin D (GSDMD) is an effector protein cleaved by inflammasome-activated caspases, allowing the liberated N-terminal GSDMD fragment to assemble into oligomers that form pores in the plasma membrane15,16. GSDMD pores mediate release of specific pro-inflammatory cytokines, namely IL-1 and IL-1817,18,19, which can promote leukocyte recruitment and viral clearance20,21,22, but unresolved pore formation can lead to pyroptotic cell death15,23,24,25. Despite these important functions, the contributions of GSDMD to viral pathogenesis have been only minimally investigated. In vitro, GSDMD was shown to be non-essential for macrophage death induced by infection with a mouse-adapted influenza virus strain, while effects on cytokine and chemokine responses were not examined8. GSDMD has been rarely investigated in viral pathogenesis studies in animal models4,9,26. Given its role as a driver of inflammation and pyroptosis, the role of GSDMD in driving inflammation during viral infection in vivo warrants further investigations.In the present study, we explore the function of GSDMD in IAV infections using Gsdmd−/− mice, which experience decreases in lung inflammation, lung dysfunction, and overall mortality during this viral infection, as well as dampened neutrophil activation and lung inflammation compared to wild type (WT) mice. The decreases in inflammation in the absence of GSDMD do not affect virus loads or hinder recovery from infection. Our study identifies GSDMD as a potential target for decreasing pathological neutrophil activities and the severity of influenza virus infections.ResultsReduced morbidity and mortality in IAV infected Gsdmd −/− miceTo investigate the roles of GSDMD during IAV infection, we infected female WT and Gsdmd−/− mice with IAV strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) (referred to hereafter as PR8). Female mice were primarily used in our studies because of their increased severity of PR8 infection compared to male mice27. We first examined lungs for GSDMD levels, including cleaved GSDMD N-terminal fragment indicative of activation, at day 7 post infection via Western blotting. Cleaved GSDMD was detected in the lungs of infected WT mice, as expected14, whereas only full-length GSDMD could be seen in lungs from mock-infected WT mice (Fig. 1A). GSDMD could not be detected in lungs from infected Gsdmd−/− mice, confirming genetic ablation in these animals (Fig. 1A). Gsdmd−/− mice lost significantly less weight than their WT counterparts (Fig. 1B), though it is important to note that the sickest WT mice succumbed to infection, masking the full extent of the protective benefits of GSDMD deficiency at later timepoints. Indeed, 60% of WT mice succumbed to infection or met humane endpoint criteria of greater than 30% weight loss, compared to roughly 10% of Gsdmd−/− animals, demonstrating a protective effect when GSDMD is absent (Fig. 1C). We next evaluated whether GSDMD impacts viral replication. We found that virus titers in the lungs of WT and KO mice were similar (Fig. 1D), indicating that GSDMD contributes to the morbidity and mortality of IAV infections without directly affecting virus levels.Fig. 1: GSDMD promotes inflammation and morbidity following IAV infection.A-D WT and Gsdmd−/− mice were intranasally infected with 50 TCID50 of IAV strain PR8.

PenH increased in both WT and KO mice following infection and peaked in both groups at day 7 post infection (Fig. 2A). However, the magnitude of PenH values was significantly lower in the Gsdmd−/− mice (Fig. 2A), revealing that the absence of GSDMD during IAV infection is beneficial to lung function. We further examined lung sections via hematoxylin and eosin staining at day 7 post infection. Although all infected lung sections showed areas of cell infiltration and consolidation, lungs from WT mice exhibited more severe pathology, with thickened alveolar septa, cellular accumulation, and less open airspace as compared to Gsdmd−/− lungs (Fig. 2B). Areas of consolidation versus open airspace were quantified as a measure of pathology in individual mice9,29. Gsdmd−/− mice indeed showed significantly decreased lung pathology via this unbiased quantification method as compared to WT mice (Fig. 2C). We next examined whether the protective benefits of the loss of GSDMD extended to male mice. We observed that male mice had a less severe infection with moderate weight loss and no fatalities, and that Gsdmd−/− mice, on average, experienced less weight loss during the infection than WT mice (Supplementary Fig 1A). Furthermore, similarly to female counterparts (Fig. 2A), male Gsdmd−/− mice exhibited a statistically significant benefit in terms of lung function as indicated by PenH values (Supplementary Fig 1B). Our results overall demonstrate that the absence of GSDMD results in an attenuation of IAV-induced lung pathology in both female and male mice. Subsequent experiments were performed using the more severe female mouse infection system in order to have a robust dynamic range for observing phenotypic and mechanistic differences between WT and Gsdmd−/− mice.Fig. 2: GSDMD exacerbates lung dysfunction and pathology following IAV infection.A–C WT and Gsdmd−/− mice were intranasally infected with 50 TCID50 of IAV strain PR8.

Source data are provided in the Source Data file.Full size image Gsdmd -/- mice have decreased inflammatory transcriptional responses to IAV infectionTo better understand the underlying mechanisms contributing to differences in survival and lung damage between WT and Gsdmd−/− animals, we compared global gene transcriptional responses of WT and Gsdmd−/− mice following IAV infection. Quantitative measurement of total lung mRNA expression at day 7 post infection showed distinct transcriptional profiles induced in WT and Gsdmd−/− animals as revealed by principal components analysis (Fig. 3A). Differential gene expression analysis (fold change |3 | , p-adj <0.01) captured 812 genes that were increased in infected WT mice compared to infected Gsdmd−/− mice, while expression of 447 genes was increased in Gsdmd−/− relative to WT mice, for a total of 1259 differentially expressed genes (Fig. 3B, Supplementary Data 1). Hierarchical clustering of gene expression revealed gene clusters that were highly upregulated (yellow cluster) and moderately upregulated (red cluster) in infected WT mice relative to Gsdmd−/− mice (Fig. 3C). Gene ontology enrichment revealed that both highly and moderately upregulated genes corresponded to biological processes involved in inflamatory and antiviral responses (Fig. 3D). Genes found to be repressed in WT infected mice relative to Gsdmd−/− mice (orange cluster), such as Kcnh2, Scn5a, and Sgcg, were found to associate with muscle function. Gene set enrichment analysis followed by network analysis further confirmed that biological processes associated with inflammation and cytokine signaling were dampened by the absence of GSDMD in IAV infection (Fig. 3E).Fig. 3: GSDMD promotes inflammatory gene expression programs in IAV infection.A–E WT and Gsdmd−/− mice were infected with IAV strain PR8 at a dose of 50 TCID50.

This gene set included interferons (IFNs), IFN-stimulated chemokines, and classical antiviral IFN-stimulated genes such as MX and OAS family genes (Fig. 4A, Supplementary Data 2). We utilized published immune-cell-specific databases (PanglaoDB) to conduct functional enrichment analysis of our differentially expressed genes and discovered significant decreases in genes associated with myeloid cells in the lungs of Gsdmd−/− mice (Supplementary Fig 2A). This was accompanied by observed enrichment of biological pathways involved in neutrophil chemotaxis in WT versus Gsdmd−/− samples as identified by GO Biological Process analysis (Fig. 4B, Supplementary Data 2), as well as by REACTOME and IPA Canonical Pathway analyses (Supplementary Fig 2B, C). These neutrophil-associated genes included a number of cytokines, chemokines, and receptors, with Ccl1 being the most significantly downregulated gene identified (Figs. 3B, 4B). These results may suggest a decrease in neutrophil numbers or decreased activation of recruited neutrophils30. To confirm these transcriptomic results, we performed qRT-PCR on lung RNA from additional cohorts of mock- or IAV-infected animals to measure expression of a panel of inflammatory genes. We broadly confirmed a decrease in inflammatory genes, including Ccl1, Cxcl9, Tnf, and Ifnb1, among others, in infected Gsdmd−/− versus WT mice, while no baseline differences were observed in the absence of infection (Fig. 4C). We further confirmed this attenuation of inflammatory cytokine and chemokine gene expression by measurement of secreted factors. We observed that the chemokine CCL1 was significantly decreased in Gsdmd−/− versus WT lungs (Fig. 4D), consistent with the highly significant changes observed for this chemokine in our gene expression assays (Fig. 4B, C). Gsdmd−/− mice also had reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IFNβ, TNF, IL-1β, and IL-18 (Fig. 4D). These results were consistent with the established role of GSDMD in facilitating release of IL-18 and IL-1β17,18,19 and with our RNA sequencing results that indicated the downmodulation of IL-1 signaling in KO lungs (Fig. 3D). Overall, these RNA sequencing, qRT-PCR, and ELISA results broadly identified decreased inflammatory responses during IAV infection in Gsdmd−/− mice.Fig. 4: IAV-induced inflammation is diminished in Gsdmd−/− mice.A, B RNAseq results as in Fig. 3 were further analyzed.

D ELISA quantification of TNF, IL-6, IFNβ, IL-1β, IL-18 or CCL1 levels in lung homogenates of mock-infected, day 3 post infection (from 1 experiment), day 5 post infection (from 1 experiment), or day 7 post infection (from 2 independent experiments) (each dot represents a single mouse, Mocks: n = 3, IAV day 3: n = 6, IAV day 5: n = 5, IAV day 7: n = 9, error bars indicate SEM, p values determined by two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test, only comparisons between day 7 infected WT and Gsdmd−/− are shown). Source data are provided in the Source Data file.Full size imageBecause GSDMD is known to mediate cytokine release and pyroptosis in macrophages, we investigated the response of human THP-1 macrophages to PR8 or an H3N2 IAV seasonal isolate with or without shRNA targeting of GSDMD levels. We observed a decrease in IL-1β, IL-6, TNF, and IFNβ levels in the supernatants of GSDMD knockdown (KD) macrophages despite comparable levels of infection as indicated by viral nucleoprotein levels in Western blots (Supplementary Fig. 3A–C). We also observed increased levels of cleaved PARP1 in WT and GSDMD KD cells after infection indicating that cell death induced by infection was not broadly prevented by GSDMD depletion (Supplementary Fig 3A), though lactate dehydrogenase release was decreased in GSDMD KD cells (Supplementary Fig 3D). Our data overall show that IAV-induced inflammatory responses are dampened in the absence of GSDMD.Loss of GSDMD reduces neutrophil activation programs during IAV infectionAdditional interrogation of our global gene expression data identified significant decreases in gene sets associated with neutrophil extracellular trap formation, NOD-like receptor signaling, and neutrophil degranulation in IAV infected Gsdmd−/− versus WT mice (Fig. 5A, B), suggesting that reduced neutrophil activities may play a role in the attenuated pathogenesis observed in Gsdmd−/− mice. Thus, we examined whether GSDMD was involved in neutrophil recruitment to the lungs during infection using flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig 4). Surprisingly, we found that both WT and Gsdmd−/− mice exhibited robust neutrophil recruitment to the lungs by day 7 post infection with no statistical difference observed between the genotypes in terms of numbers of neutrophils per lung (Fig. 5C) or percent of neutrophils relative to total CD45+ immune cells (Supplementary Fig 5). We also observed similar recruitment of other innate immune cell populations, such as eosinophils, macrophages, or natural killer cells into the lungs, and likewise, recruitment of adaptive CD4 and CD8 T cells and B cells was not impaired in Gsdmd−/− animals (Supplementary Fig 5, Supplementary Fig 6A). We additionally measured immune cell recruitment to the lungs at day 3 post infection and detected minimal cell infiltration and no differences between WT and Gsdmd−/− mice (Fig. 5C, Supplementary Fig 5, Supplementary Fig 6A). Staining for the hematopoietic immune cell marker CD45 in lung sections at day 7 post infection confirmed recruitment of lymphocytes to the lungs in both WT and KO animals (Supplementary Fig 6B). We thus hypothesized that despite similar numbers of neutrophils in the lungs of Gsdmd−/− mice, neutrophil functionality may be decreased. To test this, we measured levels of neutrophil elastase, a proteolytic enzyme released by activated neutrophils that degrades extracellular matrix and promotes neutrophil extracellular trap formation31,32,33. This indicator of activated neutrophils was significantly decreased in the lungs of infected Gsdmd−/− mice as compared to WT tissue (Fig. 5D). We similarly measured myeloperoxidase, a molecule released by azurophilic neutrophil granules that catalyzes production of reactive oxygen intermediates known to contribute to tissue damage, and found that it was also decreased in Gsdmd−/− lung tissue (Fig. 5D). Thus, products of activated neutrophils present in lungs during IAV infection were decreased in the absence of GSDMD.Fig. 5: IAV-induced neutrophil functions are decreased in the absence of GSDMD.A RNAseq results as in Fig. 3 were analyzed to create heat maps for differentially regulated genes involved with neutrophil extracellular trap formation and NOD-like receptor signaling defined by KEGG pathway analysis. B REACTOME analysis of differentially expressed genes in WT versus Gsdmd−/− mice identified differences in genes associated with neutrophil degranulation. C Neutrophil infiltration into the lungs quantified by flow cytometry of mock-infected (from two independent experiments), day 3 post infection (from 1 experiment), or day 7 post infection (from 3 independent experiments) (each dot represents a single mouse, n = 6 mocks, n = 6 day 3, n = 14 day 7, error bars indicate SEM, NS, not significant by two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test). D ELISA quantification of neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase levels in lung homogenates of mock-infected (from 1 experiment), day 3 post infection (from 1 experiment), or day 7 post infection (from 2 independent experiments) (each dot represents a single mouse, n = 3 mocks, n = 6 day 3, n = 6 day 7, error bars indicate SEM, p values determined by two way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test).

F Maximum fluorescence intensity for each infected well as in E (p-value determined by two-tailed unpaired t-test). G Neutrophil products in supernatants from cells as in E were quantified via ELISA (n = 9 with cells derived from 3 mice assayed in triplicate, error bars indicate SEM, *p values determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test). Source data are provided in the Source Data file.Full size imageTo further examine roles for GSDMD in neutrophils, we next infected primary neutrophils enriched from the bone marrow of WT or Gsdmd−/− mice (enrichment shown in Supplementary Fig 7). Ethidium homodimer-1 fluorescence in WT neutrophil media increased over time following infection, indicating that DNA release characteristic of NETosis occurred in response to virus exposure (Fig. 5E, F). Interestingly, minimal DNA staining was observed over the same time course for Gsdmd−/− neutrophils (Fig. 5E, F). Corroborating these results, we observed that release of neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase into the cell supernatants following infection was largely dependent on GSDMD (Fig. 5G). Given that neutrophils were previously reported to be directly infected by influenza virus34,35,36 and given that our in vitro results suggest a direct response of these cells to virus (Fig. 5E–G), we sought to confirm that neutrophils are infected by IAV in vivo. Using Cre recombinase-expressing PR8 in a Cre-inducible fluorescent reporter mouse37,38,39, we observed infection of alveolar macrophages, a well characterized immune cell target of IAV, and also observed a population of neutrophils expressing the Cre-induced fluorescent reporter of infection (Supplementary Fig 8A). We further noted that the infected neutrophils showed higher MHCII surface levels than non-infected cells, highlighting neutrophil activation upon infection (Supplementary Fig 8B). These findings prompted us to re-evaluate neutrophil surface markers in our previously performed flow cytometry experiments from WT or Gsdmd−/− lungs. We found that levels of Ly6G, CD11b, and Ly6C were unchanged in WT and Gsdmd−/− neutrophils with or without infection (Supplementary Fig 9A, B). In contrast, average MHCII mean fluorescence intensity was increased on lung neutrophils following IAV infection in both WT and Gsdmd−/− mice (Supplementary Fig 9A, B). These results together uncover that neutrophils are activated upon IAV infection through GSDMD-dependent and -independent pathways. Importantly, our RNA sequencing results, measurements of neutrophil products in vivo, and examination of neutrophil activity in response to IAV in vitro each indicate a dependence on GSDMD for neutrophil functionality, including release of DNA and tissue-damaging enzymes, during IAV infection.Neutrophils increase inflammation and mortality in IAV infectionTo probe whether dampened neutrophil activities could explain the decrease in influenza virus infection severity that we observed in the Gsdmd−/− animals, we depleted neutrophils early in infection in WT mice and measured infection outcomes. Briefly, we treated mice with antibodies targeting neutrophils (α-Ly6G) or an isotype control antibody, starting at day 3 post infection through day 8 post infection (Fig. 6A). This treatment timeline was chosen to allow acute neutrophil responses to proceed uninhibited prior to blockade of an excessive, pathological response, and also because it represented a test of neutrophil depletion as a therapeutic strategy. We confirmed neutrophil depletion by measuring decreases in total neutrophil numbers, as well as relative percentage of neutrophils compared to the entire CD45+ immune cell population, in the lungs of α-Ly6G treated mice at day 5 post infection (Fig. 6B, Supplementary Fig 10A–C). The specificity of neutrophil depletion was further confirmed by analyzing total counts and percentages of eosinophils and alveolar macrophages, which were unchanged between the two treatment groups. (Supplementary Fig 10A–C). When examining morbidity between the cohorts of mice, the neutrophil depleted mice experienced significantly less influenza virus-induced weight loss than the isotype control treated group (Fig. 6C). Remarkably, neutrophil depletion was completely protective against lethal infection, whereas we observed 60% lethality in isotype control-treated mice (Fig. 6D), a result that mirrored the protective effects seen in Gsdmd−/− mice (Fig. 1C).Fig. 6: Neutrophils increase influenza severity.A Schematic of IAV infection (50 TCID50) and antibody injections for (B–I).

We further observed that levels of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, IFNβ, and TNF-α, were significantly decreased in the lungs of neutrophil-depleted mice compared to controls (Fig. 6F). Likewise, CCL1 levels were commensurately decreased following α-Ly6G treatment (Fig. 6F). These results suggest that neutrophils overall potentiate inflammation in IAV infected lungs. Lastly, we quantified neutrophil elastase in the lungs of α-Ly6G treated and isotype control treated mice to further confirm that neutrophil elastase serves as a marker of neutrophil presence and activity. Indeed, we saw decreased neutrophil elastase in the lungs of α-Ly6G treated mice (Fig. 6F), reinforcing our data identifying a similar change in Gsdmd−/− versus WT mice (Fig. 5D). These results demonstrate that neutrophils provide an overall potentiation of inflammation in IAV infected lungs.To gain further insight into whether the protection provided by the loss of GSDMD during IAV infection was mediated by neutrophils, we depleted neutrophils from both WT and Gsdmd−/− animals during IAV infection (Supplementary Fig 11). We again observed that neutrophil depletion or loss of GSDMD protected mice from death and severe weight loss (Fig. 6G, H). Neutrophil-depleted Gsdmd−/− mice similarly survived the infection but did not show an added benefit over Gsdmd−/− alone in terms of weight loss (Fig. 6G, H). We also measured lung function via full body plethysmography of these mice. PenH indicative of airway resistance was increased by infection in WT isotype control-treated mice (Fig. 6I). WT mice with neutrophil depletion, Gsdmd−/− control mice, and Gsdmd−/− mice with neutrophil depletion each showed less decline in lung function allowing a more rapid recovery to baseline lung function compared to WT control-treated mice (Fig. 6I). Importantly, similar to weight loss measurements, we did not observe an added benefit of combining Gsdmd−/− with neutrophil depletion (Fig. 6I). These plethysmography measurements demonstrate that neutrophil depletion protects lung function during IAV infection and are consistent with the notion that inflammatory, lung damaging effects of GSDMD during IAV infection are mediated to a significant extent by neutrophils. In sum, our results demonstrate that neutrophil activity in the lungs during influenza virus infection is largely dependent on GSDMD and that neutrophils amplify the inflammatory response and lung dysfunction during IAV infection.DiscussionWe discovered that the inflammasome effector, GSDMD, has a detrimental impact on outcomes of influenza virus infection. In the absence of GSDMD, mice experienced reduced morbidity and mortality despite viral burden in the lungs being unaffected. Indeed, GSDMD contributed to lung inflammation, neutrophil activity, and lung dysfunction. The improved outcomes of Gsdmd−/− mice following IAV infection compared to WT mice corresponded to global transcriptional decreases in a multitude of tissue-damaging inflammatory pathways. Additionally, impaired neutrophil activity gene expression programs in the absence of GSDMD correlated with improved disease outcome, which we subsequently substantiated via exogenous depletion of these immune cells. While neutrophil depletion and genetic ablation of GSDMD are not equivalent, we note that they phenocopy each other in IAV infection outcomes in terms of decreased weight loss, improved survival, improved lung function, and decreased lung inflammation, each without affecting viral titers. These data are consistent with a model in which GSDMD-dependent neutrophil activities drive influenza virus pathogenesis. Additional data in support of this model include: 1) decreased levels of tissue damaging enzymes released by neutrophil degranulation (neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase) in Gsdmd−/− lungs, 2) decreased gene expression associated with activated neutrophils in Gsdmd−/− lungs (e.g., KEGG NETosis, REACTOME degranulation), 3) decreased functionality of purified Gsdmd−/− neutrophils in vitro (NETosis and degranulation), and 4) demonstration that depletion of neutrophils in Gsdmd−/− mice did not affect IAV-induced weight loss or lung function, indicating that the neutrophils in these KO mice are non-functional. Of the immune cell types that control influenza virus infection outcomes, neutrophils are among the first to infiltrate sites of infection40. Beneficial functions of neutrophils include phagocytic activity, cytokine and chemokine release, and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, which are traditionally associated with antibacterial activities but also promote an antiviral state41,42,43,44,45. Conversely, other studies have highlighted the potentially detrimental effect of unchecked neutrophil recruitment characterized by hyperinflammation and lung damage4,46,47,48,49,50. Our data add to a growing number of studies implicating excessive neutrophil activities as a driver of poor disease outcomes46,47,48,50.Although GSDMD was not well studied previously in terms of its effect on IAV replication or infection outcomes, it has been well characterized to play important roles in both macrophages and neutrophils in other contexts51. Indeed, pyroptotic cell death and release of IL-1 and IL-18 by macrophages are widely dependent on GSDMD in several bacterial infections51. Our in vitro results with THP-1 macrophages indicated that GSDMD depletion resulted in less secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines following infection with the IAV PR8 strain or a seasonal H3N2 strain. Neutrophils also rely on GSDMD for anti-bacterial responses, though GSDMD pores were reported to form primarily on granule and autophagic membranes rather than the plasma membrane in neutrophils52. This allowed escape of neutrophil elastase into the cytoplasm, which catalyzed noncanonical cleavage of GSDMD and further facilitated the release of IL-1β through an autophagy-dependent mechanism52. This unique feed-forward function of GSDMD in neutrophils may also be involved in its reported critical role in NETosis during bacterial challenges33,53. Our experiments also indicated that GSDMD promotes neutrophil functionality during IAV infection. While GSDMD ablation likely dampens IAV-induced inflammatory processes in both macrophages and neutrophils, our neutrophil depletion experiments implicate neutrophil activities as particularly important in mediating excessive inflammation and tissue damage in IAV infection.IAV infection is among the most common causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in adults54. Development of ARDS is marked by bilateral edema and worsened oxygen delivery55, and a major contributor to these criteria is the unchecked inflammation caused by cellular immune responses activated to control replicating virus. Specifically, neutrophil infiltration and abundance is correlated with the severity of ARDS56, and neutrophil secretion of tissue damaging enzymes, such as neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase, and inflammatory extracellular traps can exacerbate progression of ARDS54. Likewise, NETosis promoted by GSDMD was recently identified as a driver of disease progression in an LPS-induced model of ARDS57. Indeed, full body Gsdmd−/− mice show enhanced survival in a bacterial sepsis model, and this phenotype was associated with decreased inflammation and NET formation58. However, in a follow-up study, neutrophil-specific deletion of GSDMD surprisingly resulted in enhanced lethality59. Neutrophils are often essential for clearance of bacterial infections while our data show that neutrophil depletion did not affect lung titers of IAV. Thus, while neutrophils amplify inflammation in both types of infections, the functions of neutrophils are likely not fully analogous in bacterial versus viral disease. Future research using neutrophil-specific GSDMD deletion may provide further information on the role of this protein in neutrophil responses during IAV infection.While GSDMD is an effector protein in the pyroptosis pathway initiated by inflammasome activation, other intermediate proteins are likely contributing to the outcome of IAV infection. Indeed, Caspase-1/11 KO mice experience exacerbated acute illness and reduced adaptive immunity to influenza virus60,61. The requirement for specific caspases in activation of lung GSDMD during IAV infection remains to be investigated. Interestingly, neutrophil elastase has also been demonstrated to be capable of cleaving and activating GSDMD33,62, which may explain the differing outcomes of Caspase-1/11-deficient versus Gsdmd−/− in IAV infections.IL-1β and IL-18 levels were reduced in the lungs of Gsdmd−/− mice after infection but levels of these cytokines were not entirely dependent on GSDMD, despite the canonical role of GSDMD in IL-1β and IL-18 release17,18,19. These results suggest that there are partially redundant mechanisms for release of these cytokines during IAV infection. Indeed, these results are in accord with our published findings that IL-1β levels in the lung at day 2 post infection with SARS-CoV-2 are dependent on GSDMD, but that IL-1β release occurs in a GSDMD-independent manner at later timepoints post infection9. Interestingly, we found that loss of GSDMD had no significant impact on SARS-CoV-2 disease severity9, highlighting intriguing differences in the pathological mechanisms activated by SARS-CoV-2 versus IAV that warrant further study. In addition, we discovered here that GSDMD promotes IFNβ expression and production during IAV infection, further suggesting that this effector protein potentiates pro-inflammatory responses beyond the release of canonical inflammasome-associated molecules. Attenuation of several pro-inflammatory cytokine pathways, including IFNβ, in Gsdmd−/− mice had no appreciable effect on virus replication. However, it is well established that the pathological, tissue-damaging effects of IFNs continue to accumulate beyond the point at which their antiviral effects peak63,64,65. Our data indicate that loss of GSDMD during IAV infection balances the inflammatory response toward a less tissue-damaging phenotype while maintaining a response sufficient to combat virus replication. Indeed, during revision of our manuscript, a report was published in which an independently generated Gsdmd−/− mouse line challenged with a high dose of H3N2 IAV was protected from virus-induced lethality with minimal effects on virus load compared to WT animals26. Minor effects of GSDMD on neutrophil recruitment to the lungs were reported26. Future studies will likely uncover further nuanced roles for GSDMD dependending on individual virus strain pathogenicity and dosing.Overall, we found that GSDMD promotes inflammatory gene programs, tissue-damaging neutrophil activities, and lung pathology during IAV infection. Importantly, while GSDMD exacerbates severe illness, it is dispensable for recovery from infection, including lung function, thus identifying it as a promising candidate for host-directed therapeutic targeting during IAV infection.MethodsOur research complies with all relevant ethical regulations and was approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of The Ohio State University.Virus stocksInfluenza virus strains A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8, provided by Dr. Thomas Moran of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt.

Female mice possessing a loxP-flanked stop codon that prevents transcription of the red fluorescent protein tdTomato were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (B6.Cg-Gt(ROSA)26Sortm14(CAG-tdTomato)Hze/J, C57BL/6 J background, strain #007914). All mice were 8–12 weeks of age at the time of experimentation. Mice were housed in the Ohio State University’s Biomedical Research Tower vivarium, which is maintained at 68–76 degrees F, with a 12:12 light dark cycle, and humidity between 30–70%. Autoclaved individually ventilated cages (Allentown) were used for housing. Mice were fed irradiated natural ingredient chow ad libitum (Evnigo Teklad Diet 7912). Reverse osmosis purified water was provided through an automated rack water system. Cages included 1⁄4 inch of corn cob bedding (Bed-o-Cobs, The Andersons) with cotton square nesting material. Mice were infected intranasally under anesthesia with isoflurane according to protocols approved by the Ohio State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mouse infections were performed with a dose of 50 TCID50 of PR8 or 250 TCID50 for PR8-Cre. The higher dose of PR8-Cre was used due to its moderate attenuation relative to PR8. For neutrophil depletion experiments, mice were treated with 0.5 mg anti-mouse Ly6G antibody (InVivoMAb, BE0075-1) or 0.5 mg rat IgG2a isotype control, anti-trinitrophenol antibody (InVivoMAb, BE0089) via intraperitoneal injection on day 3 post infection. From days 4 through 8 post infection, mice were injected with 0.2 mg of the same antibodies. Enhanced pause (PenH) values were determined via whole-body lung plethysmography (Buxco Small Animal Whole Body Plethysmography). Mice were acclimated to the plethysmography chamber for 3 days prior to infection for 10 min/day. On days 0–14 post infection, mice were put in plethysmography chamber for a 5 min acclimation followed by a 5 min reading. PenH measurements were taken every 10 s during the 5 min recording period and the PenH values for the 10 s intervals were averaged and expressed as an absolute PenH value for that day. For determining lung titers and cytokine levels, tissues were collected and homogenized in 1 ml of PBS, flash-frozen, and stored at −80 °C prior to titering on MDCK cells or analysis via ELISA. TCID50 values were calculated using the Reed-Muench method. Greater than 30% weight loss was the primary criteria used for humane endpoint euthanasia in mouse experiments. All experiments were approved by The Ohio State University IACUC under protocol #2016A00000051-R2. This protocol adheres to the guidelines set out by the NIH adopted Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.Cell Culture and InfectionsAll cells were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Vector control and GSDMD KD THP-1 cells were generated by lentiviral shRNA-mediated targeting and were generously provided by Dr. Amal Amer at The Ohio State University. Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% EquaFETAL bovine serum (Atlas Biologicals). THP-1 were differentiated into macrophages by treatment with 25 nM phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) for 3 days as previously described68 to allow for differentiation into macrophages. Infection of THP-1 cells with PR8 or H3N2 viruses was done at an MOI of 10 for 48 h prior to collection of cells for Western blotting or cellular media for measurement of cytokines and LDH release. MDCK cells (BEI Resources, NR-2628) were grown in DMEM (Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% EquaFETAL bovine serum.Ex-vivo bone marrow neutrophil studiesNeutrophils were negatively selected from WT or Gsdmd−/− mouse bone marrow according to the EasySep Neutrophil Enrichment Kit recommended protocol (STEMCELL Technologies, 19762). Neutrophil enrichment was confirmed via flow cytometry. Neutrophil NETosis was quantified by seeding the enriched neutrophils in a 96 well plate at 30,000 cells/well with RPMI 1640 medium (Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 4 μM ethidium homodimer-1 (Invitrogen, L3224B). These cells were infected immediately with PR8 MOI 10 for 200 min during which fluorescence intensity (excitation/emission maxima 528/617) was measured every ten minutes using a SpectraMax i3X Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices). Identical plates without ethidium homodimer-1 were infected for 6 h for measurements of neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase in the cell supernatants.Western blottingFor detection of protein expression in lung tissue, samples were lysed in a 1% SDS buffer (1% SDS, 50 mM triethanolamine pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) containing a cocktail of phosphatase protease inhibitors (Sigma, 4906845001) and protease inhibitors (Thermo Scientific, A32965). The lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 10 min and soluble protein supernatants were used for Western blot analysis. Equal amounts of protein (30 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto membranes. Membranes were blocked with 10% non-fat milk in Phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST) and probed with antibodies against GSDMD (1:1000, Abcam #ab219800; clone EPR20859) and actin (1:1000, Abcam #ab3280; clone ACTN05 (C4)) with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:10,000, Cell Signaling Technologies (CST) #7074). For Western blotting of THP-1 cells, cell lysates were harvested with RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl; 1% IGEPAL CA-630; 0.5% sodium deoxycholate; 0.1% SDS; 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) supplemented with Benzonase nuclease and HALT protease and phosphatase inhibitor. Equal amounts of protein (15-30 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (BioRad). Membranes were blocked with 5% milk diluted in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). Primary antibody incubations were performed overnight with antibodies diluted in 5% BSA in TBST, followed by incubation with species-specific HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies in 5% milk in TBST. The following antibodies were used: Cleaved PARP (Asp214) XP Rabbit mAb (1:1000, CST #5625 S; clone D64E10), Monoclonal Anti-Influenza NP A/CA/04/09 (H1N1) pdm (1:1000, BEI Resources #NR-19868; clone 2F4), GAPDH Rabbit mAb (1:1000, CST #2118 L; clone 14C10), Cleaved GSDMD (Asp275) Rabbit mAb (1:1000, CST #36425 S; clone E7H9G), Human GSDMD (1:1000, Abcam #ab210070; clone EPR19829), Peroxidase AffiniPure Donkey Anti-Mouse IgG (H + L) (1:10,000, Jackson ImmunoResearch #715-035-150), Peroxidase AffiniPure Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L) (1:10,000, Jackson ImmunoResearch #711-035-152). Chemiluminescent images were acquired using a ChemiDoc Touch (BioRad).RNA extraction and quantification of gene expressionMouse lung tissue was homogenized in TRIzol reagent. Following separation with 1-bromo-3-chloropropane, aqueous phase was collected, and RNA was precipitated with ethanol. Precipitated RNA was isolated and cleaned using NucleoSpin RNA extraction kit (Machery-Nagel, #740955) following the manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA was generated using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (BioRad, #1708890) following the manufacturer’s protocol. mRNA quantification was performed using iTaq Universal SYBR Green reagents (BioRad) on a CFX-384 (BioRad) instrument using Chmp2a as a reference gene. Primers used in this study were acquired from Integrated DNA Technologies and are listed in Supplementary Data 3.ELISAsHuman IL-1β, IL-6, TNF, and IFNβ and mouse CCL1, TNF, IL-18, IFNβ, IL-1β, IL-6, neutrophil elastase, and myeloperoxidase ELISAs were performed on supernatant from lung homogenates or cell culture supernatants using the respective R&D Systems Duoset ELISA kits (catalogue # DY201, DY206, DY814-05, DY845, DY410, DY7625-05, DY8234-05, DY401, DY406, DY4517-05, and DY3667, respectively) according to manufacturer’s instructions.Flow cytometryMock or infected mouse lungs were homogenized in GentleMACS C tubes (Miltenyi) containing Dnase I (Sigma Aldrich) and type IV collagenase (Worthington Biochemical Corporation). Lungs were processed into single cell suspensions using GentleMACS equipment. Single-cell homogenates were blocked in CellBlox (Invitrogen) and viability stain was performed using eFluor 780 Fixable Viability Dye (Invitrogen, 65-0865-14) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were washed and stained with Invitrogen antibodies for Ly6G (1:333, clone 1A8-Ly6g, ref 46–9668), CD11b (1:333. clone M1/70, ref 64–0112), CD103 (1:333, clone 2E7, ref 63–1031), CD45R (1:333, clone RA3-6B2, ref 12–0452), MHCII (1:500, clone M5/114.15.2, ref 78–5321), CD8a (1:333, clone 53-6.7, ref 58–0081), CD4 (1:333, clone GK1.5, ref M001T02R02), CD3e (1:333, clone 17A2, ref 367-0032-82), CD69 (1:333, clone H1.2F3, ref 25-0691-82), CD19 (1:333, clone eBio1D3 (1D3), ref 67-0193-82), NK1.1 (1:200, clone PK136, ref 61-5941-82), and Ly6C (1:200, clone HK1.4, ref 48-5932-82) and BioLegend antibodies for CD45.2 (1:333, clone 104, ref 109838), CD11c (1:333, clone N418, ref 117320), and Siglec F (1:100, clone S17007L, ref 155524) for 30 min on ice. Cells were fixed with BD FACS lysis buffer for 10 min at 4 °C, resuspended in PBS, and run on a Cytek Aurora instrument. Count beads (Invitrogen) were added to each sample for quantification of the total cell number. Samples were analyzed using FlowJo Software (10.8.1).HistologyLung tissue samples were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin at 4 °C for 24 h and then transferred to 70% ethanol. Lungs were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, stained (H&E and anti-CD45 staining), and imaged by Histowiz (Histowiz.com, Brooklyn, NY, USA). Unbiased electronic quantification of resultant images was performed using ImageJ software and the color deconvolution method9,29,69,70.RNA sequencing and Functional Gene Enrichment AnalysisRNA was extracted from lung tissue using TRIzol (Invitrogen). RNA library preparation and sequencing was performed by GENEWIZ (GENEWIZ LLC./Azenta US, Inc South Plainfield, NJ, USA) with the following methods, as provided by GENEWIZ: “The RNA samples received were quantified using Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and RNA integrity was checked using TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina using manufacturer’s instructions (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA, #E7770S). Briefly, mRNAs were initially enriched with Oligod(T) beads. Enriched mRNAs were fragmented for 15 min at 94 °C. First strand and second strand cDNA were subsequently synthesized. cDNA fragments were end repaired and adenylated at 3’ends, and universal adapters were ligated to cDNA fragments, followed by index addition and library enrichment by PCR with limited cycles. The sequencing libraries were validated on the Agilent TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA), and quantified by using Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) as well as by quantitative PCR (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA). The sequencing libraries were multiplexed and clustered onto a flowcell. After clustering, the flowcell was loaded onto the Illumina HiSeq instrument according to manufacturer’s instructions. The samples were sequenced using a 2x150bp Paired End (PE) configuration. Image analysis and base calling were conducted by the HiSeq Control Software (HCS). Raw sequence data (.bcl files) generated from Illumina HiSeq was converted into fastq files and de-multiplexed using Illumina bcl2fastq 2.17 software. One mis-match was allowed for index sequence identification.” Raw fastq files were processed, aligned and quantified with a HyperScale architecture developed by ROSALIND (ROSALIND, Inc. San Diego, CA, https:/osalind.bio/). Read Distribution percentages, violin plots, identity heatmaps, and sample MDS plots were generated as part of the quality control step. Statistical analyses for differential gene expression were derived using ROSALIND. Specifically, sample counts were normalized via Relative Log Expression using DESeq2 R library71. DEseq2 was also used to calculate fold changes and p-values. The principal component analysis, volcano plots, and heatmaps were formatted in R using numerical values provided by ROSALIND. Gene Ontology analysis was performed using the topGO R package to determine local similarities and dependencies between GO terms in order to perform Elim pruning correction. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using published methods. Gene lists were ranked by expression and put into GSEA software for analysis using the GO Biological Processes database72,73. Network analysis was performed using Cytoscape74. Additional analysis was performed using the REACTOME database75, PanglaoDB76, the KEGG database77, and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen). Functional enrichment analysis was partially performed using Enrichr78,79.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Samples netting positive results included unpasteurized, clinical samples of milk from sick cattle collected from two dairy farms in Kansas and one in Texas, as well as an oropharyngeal swab from another dairy in Texas. These findings mark the first time that HPAI has been detected in dairy cattle, and the second time the virus had been detected in a ruminant. On March 20, the Minnesota Board of Animal Health announced that the virus had been detected in samples from juvenile goats on a Minnesota farm where poultry had recently contracted the virus. “The detection of HPAI, first in goats and now in dairy cattle, underscores the importance of adherence to biosecurity measures, vigilance in monitoring for disease, and immediately involving your veterinarian when something seems ‘off,’” said AVMA President Rena Carlson. “A complete evaluation, including the collection and submission of laboratory samples and reporting to state animal health officials in a timely fashion, when appropriate, are incredibly important." This detection of HPAI is tied to the investigation of an illness that has affected dairy cattle on farms in Texas, Kansas, and New Mexico. Sick cows are primarily older animals showing decreased lactation and low appetite, among other clinical signs. On average, about 10% of the herd on these premises appears to be affected, with little to no associated mortality reported. In addition, the dairy farms where HPAI was identified have reported finding deceased wild birds on their properties. Based on findings from Texas, the virus appears to have been introduced by wild birds. Initial testing by the USDA’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) has not found changes to the virus that would make it more transmissible to humans, which would indicate that the current risk to the public remains low. Federal and state agencies are moving quickly to conduct additional testing for HPAI, as well as viral genome sequencing, to gain a better understanding of the situation, including characterization of the HPAI strains associated with these detections. At this stage, the USDA, FDA, and CDC have indicated that they have no concern about the safety of the commercial milk supply or that this circumstance poses a risk to consumer health. Dairies are required to send only milk from healthy animals into processing for human consumption; milk from impacted animals is being diverted or destroyed so that it does not enter the food supply. In addition, pasteurization has continually proven to inactivate bacteria and viruses, such as influenza, in milk. Pasteurization is required for any milk entering interstate commerce. Federal agencies, working with veterinarians, state animal health officials, and industry partners continue to encourage farmers and veterinarians to report any signs of illness quickly so as to minimize impacts on the cattle, farmers, consumers, and other animals. This is a rapidly evolving situation and the AVMA, in partnership with the American Association of Bovine Practitioners, and state and federal partners, will continue to share updates as soon as more information becomes available.

It is interesting to note the way scientists are able to analyse the viruses and fit them within a phylogenic tree showing their relationships and evolution. The diversity of zoonotic influenza viruses that caused human infections in 2023 is alarming and infections of some types of zoonotic influenza viruses caused severe disease with a high mortality rate. In 2023 they did not transmit easily from person to person, although we never know when this may change, and therefore must be ever-ready for a pandemic.WHO will continue to strengthen surveillance, jointly with its partners, in both animal and human populations, thoroughly investigate every zoonotic infection, build up pandemic preparedness planning, and get better readiness for the next influenza pandemic. Here is a summary of some avian influenza outbreaks notified to WHO last year:EcuadorOn 9 January 2023, WHO was notified of a human infection caused by an avian influenza A(H5) virus. The case, a nine-year-old girl, living in a rural area in the province of Bolívar, Ecuador, was in contact with backyard poultry a week before the onset of her symptoms. As of 18 January she was hospitalized, in isolation, and being treated with antivirals. This was the first reported case of human infection caused by avian influenza A(H5) virus in the Latin America and the Caribbean region. Work was ongoing to further characterize the virus. Find out more about this outbreak here.CambodiaOn 23 February 2023, WHO was notified of one confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus. The case was an 11-year-old girl from Prey Veng province, in the south of Cambodia. The patient passed away on 22 February 2023. Virus sequencing showed the H5N1 virus belonged to clade 2.3.2.1c, and similar to the viruses circulating in poultry in southeast Asia since 2014. A second case, the father of the first case, was reported on 24 February 2023. However, as of 26 February he was asymptomatic and in isolation at the referral hospital. An outbreak investigation was ongoing including determining the exposure of these two reported cases to the virus.Find out more about this outbreak here.ChileOn 29 March 2023, WHO was notified of a laboratory-confirmed case of human infection caused by avian influenza A(H5) virus in the Region of Antofagasta in the north of Chile. The patient was a 53-year-old male. He had no history of comorbidities or recent travel. On 13 March 2023, he developed symptoms including cough, sore throat, and hoarseness. On 21 March, due to worsening symptoms, he sought care at a local hospital and the following day was transferred to a regional hospital. On 23 March, he was admitted to the intensive care unit. On 24 March, treatment with antivirals (oseltamivir) and antibiotics was initiated. As of 21 April, he remained in respiratory isolation under multidisciplinary management, with mechanical ventilation due to pneumonia.This was the first human infection with avian influenza A(H5) virus reported in Chile and the third reported in the Region of the Americas to date. Avian influenza A (H5N1) was first detected in the Americas in birds in December 2014. Between December 2022 and February 2023, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was detected in wild aquatic birds (pelicans and penguins) and sea mammals (sea lions) in the Antofagasta Region where the case resides. According to preliminary findings of the epidemiological investigation of this human case, the most plausible route of transmission was through environmental exposure in areas close to the residence of the case where either sick or dead sea mammals or wild birds were found. Genomic sequencing identified the virus as avian influenza virus A(H5N1) from the phylogenetic clade 2.3.4.4b. The genomic sequencing had 99.9% identity with H5 hemagglutinin sequences from Chilean birds.Find out more about this outbreak here and here.ChinaOn 27 March 2023, WHO was notified of one confirmed case of human infection with an avian influenza A(H3N8) virus. The patient was a 56-year-old female from Guangdong province with an onset of illness on 22 February 2023. She was hospitalized for severe pneumonia on 3 March 2023 and subsequently passed away on 16 March 2023. The patient had multiple underlying conditions. She had a history of exposure to live poultry before the onset of the disease, and a history of wild bird presence around her home. Results of testing showed that the samples collected from a wet market, where the patient spent time before the onset of illness, were positive for influenza A(H3). This was the third reported case of human infection with an avian influenza A(H3N8) virus; all three cases have been reported from China.Find out more about this outbreak here.United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern IrelandIn mid-May, WHO was notified of the detection of avian influenza A(H5) virus in a poultry worker at a farm in England where poultry was infected with A(H5N1) virus. Another detection was reported in a second individual performing culling operations on the farm. Both detections were later confirmed by additional testing. Both cases were asymptomatic and detected as part of an ongoing enhanced surveillance study of asymptomatic workers exposed to poultry infected with avian influenza.Find out more about this outbreak here.CambodiaBetween 24 and 25 November 2023, WHO was notified of two confirmed cases of human infection with influenza A(H5N1) from the same village in Kampot Province. Both cases were female, one in the 20-25 years age group and the other less than five years old. The first case died, while the second was being treated in hospital as of 29 November. Both cases had exposure to backyard birds, which were reported to be sick, with some having died, over the prior month. In total, six cases of influenza A(H5N1) were reported from Cambodia in 2023. Laboratory investigation shows the viruses, as indicated by phylogenetic analysis, fall within the H5 clade 2.3.2.1c with close similarity to the viruses that have been circulating in Cambodia and Southeast Asia since 2013-2014.

An investigation into the source of the illness found that the patient had contact with pigs before symptoms began. Mild illness was reported in two of the patient's close contacts, who also had contact with pigs. They were sick before the patient became ill. No person-to-person spread of H1N2v has been identified. The CDC reported four variant flu infections over the 2022-2023 flu season, of which two involved H1N2v. US flu, COVID-19, RSV levels all decline News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics COVID-19 Influenza, General Flu indicators dropped last week for the second consecutive week, as markers for COVID and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) also continued their downward trends, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said today in its latest data updates.Flu levels drop, but still above baselineOver the past few months, flu activity showed a post-holiday rise that mainly varied by region and was partly fueled by increased circulation of influenza B, which typically occurs later in the flu season. In its weekly FluView update today, the CDC said test positivity for both influenza A and influenza B decreased last week compared to the previous week. Influenza A is still dominant, making up 59.3% of positive results at public health labs, with influenza B at 40.7% Cory Doctorow / Flickr cc Other markers declined, including the percentage of outpatient visits for flulike illness, which is still above the national baseline, and hospitalizations. Deaths overall remained steady, and the CDC reported 5 more pediatric flu deaths, raising the season's total to 126, compared with 184 for the entire 2022-23 season.Steady decline in COVID indicatorsIn COVID data updates, the CDC reported more steady declines in virus impacts, both the severity markers and the early indicators. Wastewater detections of SARS-CoV-2, considered an early indicator, remained at the low level, with declines continuing in all regions of the country.Also today, the CDC released its latest variant proportion update, which shows that JN.1 is still dominant but that levels of one of its offshoots, JN.1.13, continue to rise and are now at about 11%. Study documents mortality, costs of pneumococcal disease, pneumonia News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Pneumonia DragonImages / iStock Data from US hospitals highlight the clinical and economic burden of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and non-invasive all-cause pneumonia (ACP), researchers reported yesterday in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases. Using data collected from 90 large and small US hospitals in urban and rural areas from October 2015 through February 2020, researchers from Merck and from Becton, Dickinson and Company analyzed data on hospitalized adults with an ICD-10 code for IPD, non-invasive ACP, or a positive Streptococcus pneumoniae culture or antigen test. The primary outcomes of interest included in-hospital mortality, length of stay (LOS), costs per admission, and hospital margin per admission. The researchers also analyzed antimicrobial susceptibility data. Of the 88,182 adult patients (50.7% female) included in the study, 98.6% had non-invasive ACP and 40.2% were younger than 65 years. Of 1,450 culture-positive patients, 37.7% had an isolate that was resistant to one or more antibiotic class. The overall observed hospital mortality rate was 8.3%, median LOS was 6 days, median cost per admission was $9,791, and median hospital margin per admission was $11. Patients with IPD had similar mortality rates and hospital margins compared with non-invasive ACP, but greater LOS and costs per admission. Age, ICU admission linked to mortality risk Although older age was associated with higher mortality rates, similar median LOS and costs per admission were observed across all age-groups. In adjusted analyses, the variables with the most impact on in-hospital mortality were intensive care unit admission (odds ratio [OR], 7.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.81 to 7.59) and being older than 75 (OR, 4.27; 95% CI, 3.81 to 4.78). Other significant variables included being older than 50, prior 90-day admission, high or moderate risk for pneumococcal disease, and Medicare or "other" insurance. "Our study demonstrates that adults with IPD and non-invasive ACP are at risk for poor health outcomes," the study authors wrote. "A combined approach to reducing disease incidence, including expanded vaccination programs, improved diagnostics, new anti-pneumococcal antibiotics, and targeted stewardship programs, may be needed to reduce the burden of this disease." Recent MMR vaccination may lead to false-positive measles test results News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics Measles Photo of vaccine-derived measles rash courtesy of CDC Children who are given polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests that simultaneously look for multiple causes of a rash may test falsely positive for measles if they recently had a dose of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine, according to a new study in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. MMR vaccine includes live attenuated measles virus, which is detectable by PCR tests but does not cause active infections in people with healthy immune systems. From September 2022 to January 2023, however, the Tennessee Department of Health received two reports of measles detected by PCR panels conducted for rashes. The children (aged 1 and 6 years) had no known risk factors for measles, but their rashes appeared 11 to 13 days after routine MMR vaccination. Further testing showed the PCR test had detected live attenuated measles virus used in MMR vaccine. 1% of tests positive for measles The Tennessee cases triggered a wider nationwide assessment of PCR panels. From May 2022 to April 2023, among 1,548 syndromic PCR panels conducted for rashes, 17 (1.1%) returned positive test results for measles virus. In 14 of the 17 positive tests, patients had received MMR vaccine an average 12 days before specimen collection, and none had known risk factors for acquiring measles, the authors said. Inclusion of measles virus in syndromic PCR panels can result in incidental detection of measles vaccine virus. "As demonstrated by this analysis, inclusion of measles virus in syndromic PCR panels can result in incidental detection of measles vaccine virus," the authors said. "When measles infection is not clinically suspected but detected by syndromic PCR testing, public health agencies should consider the likelihood of incidental measles vaccine virus detection by assessing measles vaccination history and risk factors." Higher rates of hospitalization, deaths among MS patients with COVID-19 News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics COVID-19 New real-world data being presented at this year's European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECCMID) conference shows that people living with multiple sclerosis (MS) face a much higher risk of being hospitalized and dying from COVID-19 than the general population, in part due to B-cell depletion therapies that can cause poor responses to vaccination. The findings are based on nearly 12 million people aged 12 years and older in England analyzed as part of the INFORM study, which looked at outcomes among immunocompromised people compared with the general population during the Omicron wave. Among the 12 million were 16,350 (0.1%) people with MS, 12,905 of whom (78.9%) had been fully vaccinated with at least three doses of a COVID-19 vaccine by January 1, 2022. In the MS group there were 215 COVID-19 hospitalizations and 25 COVID-19 deaths, resulting in incidence rates of 1.28 and 0.14 per 100 person-years, respectively. In the general population, the rates of hospitalization and death was 0.24 and 0.06 per 100 person-years, respectively. Quadruple the risk of death "Having multiple sclerosis in itself doesn't increase the risk of getting COVID-19, rather it's the taking of immune modifying medicine such as B-cell depletion therapies that can reduce the effectiveness of vaccines by preventing the immune system from mounting a robust protective response," said lead author Jennifer Quint, PhD, from Imperial College London in an ECCMID press release. It's the taking of immune modifying medicine such as B-cell depletion therapies that can reduce the effectiveness of vaccines In analyses that adjusted for age and sex, MS was associated with a seven-times-greater risk of COVID-19 hospitalization and fourfold increased risk of dying from COVID-19 compared to the general population, the authors said. "With new variants constantly emerging, people living with MS should be considered an important high-risk group for COVID-19 hospitalisation and death for which additional preventive measures and multi-layered public health protections are urgently needed," Quint said.

Global influenza surveillance, both epidemiologic and virologic, is the foundation of influenza preparedness and response for influenza viruses. Overview This work is conducted through the World Health Organization's Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) which was established in 1952. The GISRS network consists of national influenza centers (NICS) which conduct influenza virus surveillance and study influenza disease trends. There also are a number of designated WHO Collaborating Centers (CCs) that conduct further research and analysis on information and samples gathered by the NICS. What CDC is doing CDC's Influenza Division is the U.S. lead for influenza surveillance and has served as a WHO CC for Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Control of Influenza since 1956. It is the largest global resource and reference center supporting public health interventions to control and prevent seasonal and pandemic influenza. CDC also plays an important role in helping to establish, maintain, and expand influenza surveillance and laboratory capacity in more than 50 countries through the CDC Influenza Division International Program. Influenza surveillance in the United States is a collaborative effort with many partners in state, local, and territorial health departments, public health and clinical laboratories, vital statistics offices, health care providers, clinics, and emergency departments. Information in five categories is collected from eight different data sources that allows CDC to: Find out when and where influenza activity is occurring, Track influenza-related illness, Determine what influenza viruses are circulating, This includes the detection of novel influenza A viruses. Detect changes in influenza viruses, Measure the impact influenza is having on hospitalizations and deaths in the United States How CDC uses surveillance data Data from global influenza surveillance are used in preparedness and planning for seasonal influenza epidemics and the next influenza pandemic to: Monitor global trends in influenza viruses (e.g., prevalence, geographic spread and virus evolution), Quickly detect, report and respond to influenza outbreaks, Isolate novel influenza A viruses in order to study them, including to: assess the risk they pose, develop tests to detect them, determine whether currently available influenza antiviral drugs would be effective against them, and take early steps to make vaccines to respond to the next influenza pandemic. Additionally, these data are used to help formulate policy to enhance preparedness and response capacity.

(Emily Kenny/Spectrum News 1) Avian Influenza found among dairy cows in Texas, Kansas By Emily Kenny, Report for America corps member Central NY PUBLISHED 5:19 PM ET Mar. 26, 2024 PUBLISHED 5:19 PM EDT Mar. 26, 2024 SHARE The highly pathogenic avian influenza has been found among dairy cattle, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced. However, experts emphasize that there is no concern for consumers. The virus was found in unpasteurized samples of milk from farms in Texas and Kansas. It is believed to have been spread to the cows through wild birds. In New York, the most recent discovery of avian influenza in a wild bird was discovered in Suffolk County on March 20. AljoÅ¡a TrmÄiÄ, a senior extension associate for dairy foods at Cornell University, said consumers should not be alarmed. âThereâs at least two systems that protect consumers and if everything fails, this last step of pasteurization is something that can take care of any presence of this virus in raw milk,â he said. Milk pasteurization is the process of heating raw milk to a specific time and temperature to inactivate any potential pathogens instantaneously, TrmÄiÄ said. After the pasteurization process, the milk is then tested for certain indicators to ensure it was done correctly. According to the USDA, symptoms were observed primarily in older dairy cows and included decreased milk production and low appetite. On average, about 10% of the infected herds have been impacted with little to no death reported among the cattle. TrmÄiÄ said due to the close monitoring systems of dairy cows, raw milk is unlikely to be contaminated with the virus in the first place. âInfected cows quickly develop physical symptoms and are immediately identified because each cow is being monitored very closely by farmers. When they are identified, theyâre immediately segregated and their milk is discarded,â he said. This is the case for cows that become sick with any illness, their milk is immediately discarded and never enters the food system, TrmÄiÄ said. Even though raw milk is unlikely to be contaminated with the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, TrmÄiÄ does not recommend consumers drink unpasteurized milk. âThere are potential pathogens that are present in raw milk that are much higher risk for the consumer than any potential highly pathogenic avian influenza virus,â he said. Despite farmers doing their best to manage their cows, pathogens are an inherent risk when working with live animals, TrmÄiÄ said. âThey can reduce the presence of any pathogens, but it can never be completely eliminated thatâs why I would actually advise people from consuming raw milk and switching to pasteurized,â he said. The USDA said they will continue to work closely with the impacted farms and monitor the situation.

HPAI in Dairy Cattle March 25, 2024—Earlier today, the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in two dairy cattle herds in Texas and two herds in Kansas. Importantly, USDA confirmed that there is no threat to human health and milk and dairy products remain safe to consume. Pasteurization (high heat treatment) kills harmful microbes and pathogens in milk, including the influenza virus. Also, routine testing and well-established protocols for U.S. dairy will continue to ensure that only safe milk enters the food supply. In keeping with the federal Grade “A” Pasteurized Milk Ordinance (PMO), milk from sick cows must be collected separately and is not allowed to enter the food supply chain. This means affected dairy cows are segregated, as is normal practice with any animal health concern, and their milk does not enter the food supply. Consumers in the United States and around the world can remain confident in the safety and quality of U.S. dairy. Enhanced Biosecurity Protocols Underway on U.S. Dairy Farms As information related to an illness affecting dairy cows in several states began to circulate over the past two weeks, USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) worked with state veterinary authorities as well as federal partners including the FDA to swiftly identify and respond to detections and mitigate the virus’ impact on U.S. dairy production. Dairy farmers also have begun implementing enhanced biosecurity protocols on their farms, limiting the amount of traffic into and out of their properties and restricting visits to employees and essential personnel. Avian influenza is an animal health issue, not a human health concern. Importantly, mammals including cows do not spread avian influenza—it requires birds as the vector of transmission and it’s extremely rare for the virus to affect humans because most people will never have direct and prolonged contact with an infected bird, especially on a dairy farm. As a precaution, dairy farmers are taking important measures to protect their workers. The National Dairy FARM Program (NDFP) offers several valuable biosecurity resources providing dairy farmers with tools to keep their cattle and dairy businesses safe, including: Everyday Biosecurity Reference ManualEnhanced Biosecurity Prep GuideHerd Health Plan Protocol Template – BiosecurityAnimal Movement LogPeople Entry Log Biosecurity practices guidance is available here. Dairy farmers who observe clinical signs in their herd consistent with this outbreak, such as a significant loss of animal appetite and rumination or an acute drop in milk production, should immediately contact their veterinarian. Veterinarians who observe these clinical signs and have ruled out other diagnoses on a client’s farm should contact the state veterinarian and plan to submit a complete set of samples to be tested at a diagnostic laboratory. What is Pasteurization? Pasteurization is a process that kills harmful bacteria and pathogens, including viruses, by heating milk to a specific temperature for a set period of time. The processing of milk products involves pasteurization of the raw milk to a minimum of 161.5˚F for 15 seconds and then immediately cooling it. Ultra pasteurization is a process that heats milk at a higher temperature for specified times to extend a product’s shelf life. What is Avian Influenza? Detections of avian influenza in birds, including chickens, are common in the United States in the spring and fall due to wild birds spreading the virus as they migrate to and from their seasonal homes. While it is uncommon for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza to affect dairy cows, USDA APHIS has been tracking detections of HPAI in mammals for many years in the United States, leading dairy farmers and veterinarians in the United States to prepare for this eventuality. As a result, dairy farmers have taken immediate measures to enhance biosecurity measures in and around dairy farms to keep the food supply safe. About the Illness in Cows Dairy producers with affected cows are reporting a rapid onset illness in herds, specifically among older, lactating cows. Clinical signs include: Decreased herd level milk productionAcute sudden drop in productionDecrease in feed consumptionAbnormal feces and some feverOlder cows may be more likely to be severely impacted than younger cows According to dairy farmers and veterinarians reporting on affected herds, most affected cows recover within two to three weeks. Information for Affected Producers Producers who believe dairy cattle within their herd are showing the clinical signs described above should report these signs immediately to state veterinarians. Animals may also be reported to APHIS' toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593. Trade and Exports The U.S. dairy industry will continue to work with the U.S. federal government, trading partners and the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) to encourage adherence to WOAH standards and minimize all unnecessary or unfair trade impacts. It is essential that trading partners do not impose bans or restrictions on the international trade of dairy commodities in response to these and future notifications and rely on the science-based food safety steps taken in U.S. dairy processing, namely pasteurization, in preserving market access. Additional Information To provide context on the overall size of the U.S. dairy herd, there are more 9.3 million dairy cows in the United States.U.S. dairy export value was $8.11 billion in 2023, the second largest value on record.

There's no evidence of the infection spreading between people. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The infected person lives near a pig farm, health officials reported. (Image credit: Scott Olson / Staff via Getty Images News) A child in Pennsylvania caught a case of swine flu after being in contact with pigs, health officials reported Friday (March 29).The infection marks the first human case of swine flu flagged in the U.S. so far this year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported in its Weekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report.The infection, initially detected by the Pennsylvania Department of Health, was caused by a "novel" influenza A virus, one of the major types of flu virus. The detected virus belongs to a known subtype of influenza A that regularly infects pigs, called H1N2, but it's a newly identified strain. Sporadically, swine flu viruses like H1N2 can jump into humans, and when they do, they're known as "variant" influenza viruses.Human infections with variant flu viruses most often happen in people with recent exposure to infected pigs. For instance, it's thought that sick pigs may cough or sneeze droplets containing virus into the air, where they can then be inhaled by people or deposited on surfaces that people then touch. In this recent case, local health officials found that the patient had "swine contact prior to their illness onset." In an emailed statement, the CDC added that the infected person lives near a pig farm in Pennsylvania.Related: The worst epidemics and pandemics in historyThe infected child started receiving medical care for the infection on March 9, was ultimately hospitalized and has since recovered. There is no evidence that the infection spread from the infected person to additional people, the CDC reported, although "the investigation is ongoing."Health officials did report that two of the patient's close contacts developed mild illness and had been in contact with pigs before the patient fell ill. However, the report doesn't specify if these two individuals are also suspected of experiencing swine flu.Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter nowGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over."It is important to note that in most cases, variant influenza viruses have not shown the ability to spread easily and sustainably from person to person," the CDC noted in its report. (The "swine flu" pandemic in 2009 involved a virus containing a mix of genes from swine, avian and human influenza viruses, which enabled it to spread easily between people.)Human swine flu cases most often cause symptoms similar to the regular seasonal flu. These include fever, lethargy, poor appetite and coughing. Some people develop a runny nose, sore throat, eye irritation, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. That said, swine flu can sometimes progress and cause serious illness that requires hospitalization and can potentially be fatal, similar to seasonal flu. Antiviral drugs used to treat seasonal flu can also treat swine flu.RELATED STORIES—Could we ever eradicate the flu?—Scientists reveal rare antibodies that target 'dark side' of flu virus—A branch of the flu family tree has died and won't be included in future US vaccinesLast year, the CDC reported two human swine flu infections that were tied to agricultural fairs in Michigan, and in 2022, it reported four — three connected to an agricultural fair and one of unknown origin. Precautions people can take to avoid swine flu include not eating or drinking near pigs; avoiding contact with pigs that appear sick; and washing their hands often with soap and water before and after contact with pigs.This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.Ever wonder why some people build muscle more easily than others or why freckles come out in the sun?

Cigarette smoke (CS) causes pulmonary diseases including bronchitis, emphysema, and lung cancer. Although habitual smoking is thought to increase the risk of severe seasonal influenza virus infection, its effect on A(H7N9) virus infection is poorly understood. Here, we employed a mouse model of long-term exposure to CS to investigate the effect of CS on the pathogenicity of A(H7N9) virus infection. Unexpectedly, body weight loss for mice exposed to CS was milder than that for mock-treated mice upon A(H7N9) virus infection. CS exposure improved the survival rate of A(H7N9) virus-infected mice even though virus titers and pathological changes in the lungs were not significantly different between CS-exposed and control mice. Microarray analysis showed that CS-exposure activates cytokine/chemokine activity, immune response, and cell cycle activities that resemble reactivities against A(H7N9) virus infection. Therefore, under conditions where cytokine and chemokine expression in the lungs is already high due to CS exposure, the enhanced expression of cytokines and chemokines caused by A(H7N9) virus infection might be less harmful to the organs compared to the rapid increase in cytokine and chemokine expression in the air-exposed mice due to the infection. CS may thus induce immunoregulatory effects that attenuate severe pulmonary disease during A(H7N9) virus infection. However, these findings do not support CS exposure due to its many other proven negative health effects.

Since then, five epidemic waves of A(H7N9) infection, comprising 1568 confirmed human cases and 615 deaths, have occurred in eastern China2. The A(H7N9) virus is a reassortant of three avian viruses3. Studies of primary isolates from humans with A(H7N9) infection have revealed that the hemagglutinin (HA) of A(H7N9) viruses binds to human-type receptors (α2,6-linked sialosides), conferring infectivity to human respiratory organs4,5. During the fifth wave, from 2016 to 2017, highly pathogenic A(H7N9) virus emerged in poultry and infected humans6,7. This highly pathogenic A(H7N9) virus had increased pathogenicity in mammals such as mice and ferrets compared with the earlier A(H7N9) viruses and could transmit among ferrets by respiratory droplets8. To combat this threat, China undertook a national vaccination strategy with the H5/H7 bivalent avian influenza vaccine. It effectively controlled outbreaks and circulation of A(H7N9) viruses in poultry, significantly reduced the virus load in the environment, and prevented further A(H7N9) virus infections in humans. Since October 2017, only four human cases have been reported, with the most recent case being reported in March of 20199. Although human cases have clearly decreased, careful monitoring of A(H7N9) virus is essential to ensure a prompt response to the emergence of an isolate with pandemic potential.Epidemiologic studies have shown that many patients with confirmed A(H7N9) virus infection were exposed to poultry in the live poultry markets and backyards10,11. Studies by Cowling et al. and Zhou et al. in different seasons showed that people infected with A(H7N9) virus tended to be older than people infected with other avian influenza viruses such as the A(H5N1) virus [i.e., median age of 57 years for A(H7N9) cf. median age of 26 years for A(H5N1)]12,13. These epidemiological features of A(H7N9) virus were common among all five epidemic waves14. In addition to age and poultry exposure, susceptibility to and mortality following A(H7N9) virus infection are influenced by underlying medical conditions including chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and immunosuppression11. The effect of cigarette smoke (CS) on A(H7N9) virus infection in humans is unclear because the subpopulation of smokers among the cases of A(H7N9) virus infection was too low to analyze epidemiologically compared with controls11.CS exposure in humans is associated with an increased risk of seasonal influenza virus infection and severe symptoms15,16,17. A meta-analysis showed that current smokers were more than 5 times likely to develop influenza than nonsmokers18. CS triggers the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-8 and TNF-α) by resident immune cells and epithelial cells, resulting in elevated neutrophil and macrophage levels in the lungs19,20,21,22. In CS-exposed mouse model studies, seasonal influenza virus infection resulted in worse disease outcomes compared to non-smoking controls: CS-exposed mice showed severe weight loss23,24,25,26 and higher mortality22,24,26,27 compared to non-CS infected mice. The poorer outcomes in the CS mouse model could be due to suppression of antiviral immune responses by CS exposure that allow superior propagation of the virus and/or that the viral infection triggers an exaggerated inflammatory response28. Yet, Han et al. report that CS exposure suppresses the inflammatory response induced by seasonal influenza virus infection in a nicotine-dependent manner and reduces body weight loss and mortality29. These studies employed a sublethal dose of seasonal H1 or H3 influenza virus for a CS-exposure model and measured specific cytokine and chemokine responses with or without infection and CS exposure. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of CS exposure on the pathogenicity of A(H7N9) virus infection, which is more virulent than seasonal H1 and H3 influenza virus infection. Furthermore, we performed a microarray analysis to draw a complete picture of the inflammatory response to A(H7N9) virus infection after CS exposure.ResultsCS exposure inhibits body weight loss upon A(H7N9) virus infectionTo examine whether CS affects the pathogenesis of A(H7N9) virus infection, we used a CS-exposure mouse model, which has been established previously30,31. Air-exposed mice and CS-exposed mice were infected with A(H7N9) virus and their body weight changes were monitored for 14 dpi. Air-exposed mice showed severe body weight loss and died within 10 dpi (Fig. 1). In contrast, 100%, 100%, and 75% of mice exposed to CS for 30 days, 90 days, and 180 days, respectively, survived with slightly less body weight loss. These results suggest that CS exposure for 30, 90, and 180 days consistently reduces the pathogenicity of A(H7N9) virus in mice.Fig. 1: Body weight changes and survival rates of CS- or air-exposed mice after A(H7N9) virus infection.Mice (n = 4 per group) that were exposed to CS or air for 30, 90, or 180 days were infected with 103 PFU of A(H7N9) virus. Average body weight with SD (*p < 0.05) and survival monitored daily for 14 days were shown.Full size imageWe next measured virus titers in the nasal turbinates and lungs of the CS- or air-exposed mice at 2 and 5 dpi with A(H7N9). Virus titers in nasal turbinates at 2 dpi with A(H7N9) virus were significantly higher in CS-exposed mice than those in air-exposed mice (Fig. 2). In contrast, virus titers in lung tissues did not differ between CS- and air-exposed mice upon A(H7N9) virus infection except that the virus titer on 2 dpi with 103 PFU of virus in the mice exposed to CS for 90 days was significantly lower than that of the air-exposed mice. These data indicate that CS exposure might enhance A(H7N9) virus replication in the nasal turbinates especially at 2 dpi.Fig. 2: Virus titers in the lungs of CS- or air-exposed mice after A(H7N9) virus infection.Mice (n = 3 per group) were exposed to CS or air for 30, 90, or 180 days. Nasal turbinates and lungs were isolated from mice at 2 or 5 dpi with 102 or 103 PFU of A(H7N9) virus. Virus titers with average bars in these tissues were determined by use of plaque assays with MDCK cells. (*p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01)Full size imageCS exposure attenuates lung inflammation in A(H7N9) virus-infected miceTo address the pathological effect of A(H7N9) virus infection, we histologically analyzed lung tissues from mice exposed to CS or air after A(H7N9) virus infection. Since the observed reduced pathogenicity of A(H7N9) virus was similar under all three exposure conditions (see Fig. 1), we focused on the 180 day-exposure condition for further analysis. In mock-infected mice, there were no significant differences in emphysema-like changes in the lungs of CS-exposed mice compared to the lungs of air-exposed mice. Several small lymphoid follicles along the bronchioles and alveolar ducts were detected in the CS-exposed mice (Fig. 3b), whereas such pathological changes were not apparent in the air-exposed mice (Fig. 3a). Immunohistochemistry using antibodies against B220 and Mac-3, which are markers for a pan-B cells and macrophages, respectively, showed that these follicles contained accumulated B220+ cells (Fig. 3d), and high numbers of Mac-3+ cells were observed throughout the alveoli (Fig. 3e). The follicles were likely induced by the CS-exposure; however, their pathological significance is unknown.Fig. 3: Histological characteristics of the lungs of mock-infected mice exposed to air or CS.Lungs were isolated from mice exposed to CS or air for 180 days. H&E staining of fixed lung tissues from air-exposed mice (a), and CS-exposed mice (b). c Enlarged image of the rectangle in b. Immunohistochemistry of serial sections of CS-exposed mice was assessed by staining the sections with a mouse anti-B220 antibody (d) and a mouse anti-Mac-3 antibody (e). B220 and Mac-3 are markers for pan-B cells and macrophages, respectively. Scale bars, 100 µm.Full size imageWe next compared the pathology of the lungs between the air- and CS-exposed mice at 2 and 5 dpi with A(H7N9) virus. At 2 dpi, inflammatory cells accumulated along the bronchus and blood vessels at a similar level and the number of inflammatory cells in the alveoli region was similar between the CS-exposed mice and the air-exposed mice (Fig. 4). Virus antigen-positive cells were detected among the bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes of both the air- and CS-exposed mice on 2 dpi. On 5 dpi, the number of virus antigen-positive alveolar type II pneumocytes had increased in the lungs of both the air- and CS-exposed mice compared with 2 dpi. These pathological data indicate that the inflammatory response and virus distribution are similar in the lungs of CS-exposed and air-exposed mice after A(H7N9) virus infection. Overall, the histological changes caused by the CS exposure make this evaluation difficult.Fig. 4: Lung pathology of CS- or air-exposed mice after A(H7N9) virus infection.Lung tissues of mice that were exposed to CS or air for 180 days were isolated at 2 or 5 dpi with 103 PFU of A(H7N9) virus. H&E staining and immunohistochemistry using anti- type A influenza virus NP antibodies were performed on fixed lung tissues. Scale bars, 200 µm.Full size imageCS exposure alters the inflammatory response upon A(H7N9) virus infectionTo analyze the influence of CS exposure on the host response, we performed a gene expression microarray of the lungs of air- and CS-exposed mice infected with 103 PFU of A(H7N9) virus. The number of differentially expressed probes of the air-exposed mice at 5 dpi was increased from that at 2 dpi (Supplementary Fig. S1). There were considerably fewer differentially expressed probes in the lungs of CS-exposed mice both at 2 and 5 dpi compared with those of air-exposed mice, especially at 90 and 180 days of CS exposure (Supplementary Fig. S1). As our primary interest is how habitual smoking impact infection, we focused our statistical analysis on interaction effects. This analysis identifies genes that are differentially expressed due to infection depending on the CS-exposure status of the animal. We performed a two-way ANOVA to assess interaction effects between CS exposure and infection status on gene expression. This analysis revealed a statistically significant interaction (Itrx) between the effects of smoke exposure and infection status (FDR < 0.01 using the F-statistic to evaluate significance across different exposure periods) for 538 probes mapping to 461 unique gene entrez IDs, meaning that the expression of these 461 genes was affected by both CS exposure and infection.To characterize the differences between air-exposed and CS-exposed animals, the 461 differentially expressed genes where clustered horizontally and functional enrichment analysis was performed by using ToppCluster. Differences in gene expression across conditions were illustrated by using the mean gene expression of all genes assigned to each cluster, resulting in the identification of four clusters. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that these clusters contained genes associated with: (i) humoral immunity, TNF-α production, and complement pathway; (ii) type I & II interferon signaling; (iii) adaptive immune response and B/T cell activation; and (iv) mitosis and cell cycle (Supplementary Table S1 and Fig. 5). Analysis of cluster gene expression dynamics across conditions showed that there were significant differences between air-exposed and CS-exposed animals in the mock samples, but that the differentially expressed genes between the two cohorts became similar upon A(H7N9) virus infection, especially at 5 dpi (Fig. 5). These data indicate that CS exposure activates cytokine/chemokine activity, immune response, and cell cycle activities that resemble reactivities against A(H7N9) virus infection.Fig. 5: Clustered genes significantly impacted by smoking and infection status.Genes with a statistically significant interaction between the effects of smoke exposure and infection status (two-way ANOVA; FDR < 0.01) were clustered by using their gene expression across experimental conditions (n = 3 per condition). Shown is the mean log fold change (LFC) relative to mock-infected, air-exposed animals for all genes in each cluster. Gene ontology analysis was applied to the genes in each cluster to identify significant functional associations (a complete list of all enriched ontologies is available in Supplementary Table S1).Full size imageFinally, network-based analysis of the 461 differentially expressed genes was employed to identify key factors contributing to the expression profile in CS-exposed mice. This analysis suggested that several common immune regulators (e.g., TNFRSF1A, TNF-α, IL-1β, TNFSF12, EGR1, and CHUK) are differently regulated in CS-exposed mice (Supplementary Fig. S2). In particular, TNF-α was identified as a potential upstream regulator of the differentially expressed genes and was also observed to be primarily up-regulated in the lung by CS exposure (Supplementary Fig. S2). Several differentially expressed chemokines, including CXCL6, CCL9, CCL2, CCL3L1/CCL3L3, IL12b, SSA1, and MADCAM1, which affect phagocyte migration and lymphocyte movement, were regulated by TNF-α (Supplementary Fig. S3). Therefore, TNF-α may be a key regulator for protection against A(H7N9) virus infection in the CS-exposed mice.DiscussionCigarette smoking is a widely known risk factor for numerous diseases such as lung cancer32, COPD33, and cardiovascular disease34. CS is also reported to increase the risk of respiratory infectious diseases caused by viruses such as influenza virus, human rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus15,17,35,36. Contrary to epidemiological evidence, our study using a CS-exposed mouse model showed that CS exposure reduced the virulence of A(H7N9) virus without a significant reduction in virus titers. Highly pathogenic influenza viruses such as A(H7N9) and A(H5N1) viruses induce aberrant production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines including TNF-α, IL-6, and MCP-1 in the lungs of mice and cynomolgus macaques4,37, which leads to tissue damage through infiltration and activation of inflammatory cells38. However, our microarray analysis revealed that the expression of cytokines and chemokines was upregulated by CS exposure alone and the expression of cytokines and chemokines of air-exposed mice after A(H7N9) virus infection were similar to those of CS-exposed mice. These results indicate that when cytokine and chemokine expression in the lungs is already high due to CS exposure prior to infection, although their expression could be further enhanced by the viral infection, the increase rate of their expression levels in CS-exposed mice was modest compared to that in the control mice, suggesting that the rapid increase in cytokines and chemokines seen in air-exposed mice upon viral infection may be harmful to the respiratory organs, especially the lungs. Furthermore, since both CS exposure and A(H7N9) virus infection trigger the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as TNF-α4,19,20,21,22,37, the attenuated pathogenicity of A(H7N9) virus infection in the CS-exposed mice might involve inflammatory signaling, especially through TNF-α-related pathways. Further studies are needed to determine the consistency and explore the mechanism of attenuated pathogenicity of A(H7N9) virus under the condition of high cytokine and chemokine expression prior to infection.There are conflicting reports regarding the effects of CS exposure on a sublethal infection with seasonal influenza virus. Several studies have shown that mice exposed to CS had worse disease outcomes after infection with a sublethal dose of seasonal influenza virus compared to non-smoking controls22,23,24,25,26,27. These studies also revealed that pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and Il-6, were expressed at higher levels in CS-exposed, infected mice compared to air-exposed, infected mice22,26. These results imply that the enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine production might cause lethal damage to the lungs of the infected mice. In contrast, another study showed that CS exposure suppresses the pro-inflammatory response after a sublethal dose of seasonal influenza virus, resulting in protective effects against influenza virus infection29. These conflicting reports both employed a sublethal dose of seasonal influenza virus and measured specific cytokine and chemokine responses by ELISA and/or RT-qPCR. Our sublethal challenge infection with A(H7N9) virus supported the latter report: CS exposure had a protective effect through the induction of inflammatory responses, although the virus titers in the nasal turbinates of the CS-exposed mice were higher than those of the air-exposed mice. Our microarray analysis could not explain why CS exposure switches to an antiviral or proviral effect or why virus titers in the nasal turbinates of CS-exposed mice are higher than those of controls. Further comprehensive studies are needed to answer these questions.CS contains numerous chemical compounds that modulate gene expression in mammalian cells39. Among them, nicotine, a major component of CS, can suppress the immune response, including the antigen-specific immune response of T cells and the innate immune response of alveolar macrophages in vivo and ex vivo40,41,42. Han et al. report that CS exposure of mice suppressed the inflammatory response against seasonal influenza virus infection in a nicotine-dependent manner and improved body weight loss and mortality29. Therefore, another possibility for the attenuated pathogenicity of A(H7N9) virus in the CS-exposed mice might be the regulatory effect of nicotine on inflammatory signaling, especially the TNF-α related pathways.Unlike seasonal H1 and H3 viruses, the impact of CS on A(H7N9) virus infection in humans was unclear because of limited epidemiological data. To rectify this, we utilized the CS-exposure mouse model and an A(H7N9) virus that lacks a furin-cleavage site in its HA protein, not a highly pathogenic A(H7N9) virus. The former mainly replicates in the respiratory tract, whereas the latter replicates in multiple organs of mice. We selected this low pathogenic A(H7N9) virus to compare the effects of CS on A(H7N9) virus to the findings of previous reports on the effects of CS against seasonal influenza viruses, which mainly replicate in the respiratory tract. Here, we found that CS exposure reduced the pathogenicity of A(H7N9) virus infection in mice. However, it is important to note that if we had used a highly pathogenic A(H7N9) virus with the furin-cleavage site, our findings may have been different.We observed that the lungs of mice were histologically altered upon CS exposure; inflammatory cells, mainly macrophages, infiltrated the alveolar spaces. In addition, lymphoid follicles were found in the lungs of the CS-exposed mice. CS exposure induces increased permeability of epithelial cells, mucus overproduction, impaired mucociliary clearance, increased release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, enhanced recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils, and disturbed lymphocyte balance towards Th228,43. These infiltrating cells might secrete proteases such as matrix metalloproteinases and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines44, resulting in alteration of the cellular status of the lung epithelial cells. However, the mechanism of lymphoid follicle formation induced by CS exposure and the functions of lymphoid follicles remain unclear. Further analyses are required to reveal the formation process and functions of lymphoid follicles.In summary, here, we showed that CS exposure had a protective effect against A(H7N9) virus infection through upregulated inflammatory responses prior to infection. Despite such beneficial effects, the detrimental health effects of habitual smoking in humans are proven. Therefore, we do not recommend habitual smoking at all.MaterialsViruses and cellsA/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) 4virus was propagated in embryonated chicken eggs. All experiments with A(H7N9) virus were performed in enhanced biosafety level 3 (BSL3) containment laboratories at the University of Tokyo (Tokyo, Japan), which are approved for such use by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries of Japan.Exposure of mice to cigarette smokeSeven-week-old female C57BL/6j mice were purchased from Charles River Japan Inc. (Japan). Mouse cigarette smoke exposure experiments were conducted at the CMIC Bioresearch Center (Yamanashi, Japan), an institution accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (identification number: 001182). Mice were exposed to cigarette smoke (Peace®, 28 mg of tar, 2.3 mg of nicotine/cigarette, Japan Tobacco Inc., Tokyo, Japan) or to air (as a control) for 20‒30 min per exposure time by using a mainstream smoke-generating apparatus (INH06-CIG01A, M.I.P.S. Inc., Osaka, Japan) twice or three times a day for 30–180 days (Fig. 6). Smoking frequency was set to 3 exposures per day after 60 or 90 days to enhance the effects of CS exposure.Fig. 6: Schedule of CS exposure.For the 30-day exposure to CS group, mice were exposed to cigarette smoke twice a day. For the 90-day exposure to CS group, mice were exposed to cigarette smoke twice a day for 60 days and then three times a day for the last 30 days. For the 180-day exposure to CS group, mice were exposed to cigarette smoke twice a day for the first 90 days and then three times a day for the latter half of the experiment. After CS exposure, mice were infected with A(H7N9) virus at the timepoints indicated by the black tringles.Full size imageInfection of mice with A(H7N9) virusMice (n = 4 per group) exposed to CS were intranasally inoculated with 102 or 103 PFU of A(H7N9) virus in 50 μl of PBS under sevoflurane anesthesia, and body weights and survival were monitored daily for 14 days post-inoculation (dpi). Lungs and nasal turbinates were harvested from virus-infected mice (n = 3 per group) for virus titration, micro array analysis, and histological experiments at 2 and 5 dpi. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the regulations of the University of Tokyo Committee for Animal Care and Use and were approved by the Animal Experiment Committee of the Institute of Medical Science of the University of Tokyo (PA13-28).Virus titrationThe virus titers in the lungs and nasal turbinates collected at 2 and 5 dpi were determined by performing plaque assays on MDCK cells.Pathological examinationExcised mouse lung tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer solution. The tissues were then processed for paraffin embedding and cut into 3-μm-thick sections. The sections of each tissue sample were stained using a standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) procedure. Each serial section was processed for immunohistological staining with a rat anti-mouse CD45R/B220 (BD Pharminben, Cat 553084), a rat anti-mouse Mac-3 (BD Pharmingen, Cat 550292), and a rabbit polyclonal antibody for type A influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) antigen (prepared in our laboratory). Specific antigen–antibody reactions were visualized by using 3,3’-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) and the DAKO LSAB2 system (DAKO Cytomation) as described previously4.Microarray analysisTotal RNA was extracted from lung samples by using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA sample was labeled with Cy3 dye with the Quick Amp labeling kit (Agilent Technologies), and hybridized to the Mouse Gene Expression Microarray (Agilent Microarray Design Identification Number 028005; Agilent Technologies), as previously described38. Individual microarrays were performed for each lung sample that was collected from naïve and infected animals exposed to CS or air. Statistical analysis was performed using the LIMMA package. The log2 of the intensity of each probe was background corrected and normalized between arrays (using the quantile method). Duplicate probes were averaged. Hierarchical clustering was used to review biological replicate quality. For each exposure period (30, 90, and 180 days) and day post-infection (2 and 5 dpi), a two-way ANOVA was performed with CS exposure (CS-exposed vs air-exposed) and infection status (infected vs mock) as fixed variables. Supplementary Fig. S1 shows the number of genes differentially expressed for the main effects (infected vs uninfected for exposed or unexposed animals) and the interaction effects of these two fixed variables when using the moderated t statistic for each contrast and considering a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 for differentially expressed genes. To focus on genes differentially expressed based on the interaction of smoke-exposure and infection across the six groups (30-, 90-, and 180-day exposure and then sampled at 2 or 5 dpi), TopTable was used to extract the genes that were differentially expressed, which was defined as having an FDR < 0.01 when considering the F-statistic. The expression of these genes is visualized in Fig. 5. Primary gene expression data are available in Gene Expression Omnibus (series number GSE261627) in accordance with proposed Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment (MIAME) guidelines. Mouse gene annotations for the array were provided by Agilent via Agilent’s eArray.Gene functional enrichment analysisFunctional enrichment analysis was performed with ToppCluster and Ingenuity’s Pathway Analysis (IPA). For ToppCluster, an enrichment score >2 (corresponding to an FDR < 0.01) was the minimum required for enrichment. A p value < 0.01 was required for all analysis performed with IPA.Statistical analysisWe used R (www.r-project.org) and lme445 to perform a linear mixed effects analysis of the body weight data (normalized to the initial weight of each individual animal). As fixed effects, we used the air and CS groups, and the time of the measurement (with an interaction term between those fixed effects). As random effects we had intercepts for the individual animals. We used the lsmeans46 package to compare the groups at different timepoints, for each model separately, and the p-values were adjusted using Holm’s method. For the comparisons of virus titers of different organs at different timepoints, we used a two-way ANOVA, followed by pairwise comparisons of the groups at each timepoint. The titers measured in the lungs and in the nasal turbinates were analyzed separately. The p-values were adjusted using Holm’s method. For the analysis of the survival data, we used the Log-rank test, comparing the CS group to the control group. We used the OASIS 247 software for this analysis.

With coordinated technical and financial support from the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza in Melbourne, Australia, the WHO South East Asia Regional Office, and the WHO Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework Partnership Contribution, core influenza surveillance and laboratory detection capacities have been strengthened – making the NPHL the primary laboratory in the country for influenza surveillance, and now a member of the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). Timor-Leste benefited from consistent technical mentorship and support to build and strengthen key functions needed for influenza surveillance and detection – including specimen collection and referral, and diagnostics using RT-PCR techniques. These capacities were demonstrated on an annual basis through their participation and high-scoring in the WHO External Quality Assessment Programme (EQAP) – despite logistical challenges. It was also the basis for quickly establishing and maintaining testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2, which greatly benefited their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This formed the basis for the next steps in the recognition process, including continuous mentoring, and conducting joint assessments with the WHO Collaborating Centre and SEARO – which included procedural and document reviews, and field visits. Through this, and further periodic assessments, key areas needing further strengthening were identified and improved, including for bio-risk management, quality control, and equipment maintenance.Throughout this process, Timor-Leste demonstrated increased participation in the GISRS network – including sharing influenza viruses with WHO Collaborating Centres, reporting influenza virological surveillance data to FluNet, participation and high scoring in the WHO EQAP, and in 2022, reporting of epidemiological data to FluID. This participation improves data representativeness and facilitates a timely and more effective response to a future influenza pandemic.Acknowledging the improvements made by NPHL, the national commitment to building and sustaining influenza surveillance and detection capacities, and their consistent participation in the GISRS network, by August 2023 the NPHL was recognized as the 151nd NIC in GISRS.

NIAID/Flickr cc The infection involved a 21-year-old college student whose H5 infection was initially reported last week by the media and was confirmed by provincial health authorities. Today's health ministry statement has new details about the case, including that the patient died from his infection on March 23. Officials also said that an epidemiologic investigation found that the man had trapped wild birds near his home before and after the Lunar New Year holiday. No sick or dead poultry, however, were reported near the family's home. No other cases have been detected during monitoring of the patient's contacts. Questions remain about H5N1 clade So far, it's not clear which H5N1 clade is involved in the man's infection. The older clade (2.3.2.1c)—still circulating in some parts of Asia—has recently been connected to a spate of illnesses in Cambodia, many of them fatal. The newer clade (2.3.4.4b) affecting poultry in multiple world regions has also infected people in rare instances, mainly those who had exposure to infected birds or mammals. Vietnam's last H5N1 case, reported in October 2022 from Phu Tho province, was its first since 2014. The clade involved was not reported in that case, either. The health ministry said the country continues to report sporadic H5N1 detections in poultry and that agriculture ministry data show that six avian flu outbreaks have been reported across six provinces, including Khanh Hoa, where the man lived. FDA OKs Invivyd's COVID preventive Pemgarda for emergency use News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics COVID-19 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on March 22 granted emergency use authorization (EUA) for Invivyd's monoclonal antibody to prevent COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients, which fills a gap following the withdrawal of Evusheld in January 2023. Amornrat Phuchom / iStock The monoclonal antibody, called pemivibart (Pemgarda), is authorized for pre-exposure prophylaxis in adolescents and adults with moderate-to-severe immunocompromise, such as solid-organ transplant recipients and those with blood cancers. The drug is given as a 4,500-milligram intravenous infusion. The company had submitted its EUA request in early January. The FDA based its EUA on clinical trials that suggested pemivibart had neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants, including JN.1, which is currently dominant in the United States and abroad. In its announcement, the company, based in Massachusetts, also said pemivibart is its first pre-exposure monoclonal antibody to receive an EUA based on a novel, rapid, and repeatable immunobridging trial design, which it said will help address ongoing viral evolution. Drug will be available for ordering soon Dave Hering, Invivyd's chief executive officer, said in the statement that the company expects to have the product available for ordering "imminently" and that an initial supply has already been packaged and is awaiting release at a US-based third-party logistics provider. He also added that the company has plans to explore pemivibart as a treatment for symptomatic COVID infection. CDC releases ventilation guidance for curbing indoor respiratory virus spread News brief Lisa Schnirring Topics COVID-19 Influenza, General Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) As part of its updates on strategies to battle respiratory viruses, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on March 22 detailed steps that people can take to reduce the number of respiratory particles that circulate in indoor air. The ventilation guidance update comes as respiratory disease levels such as flu and COVID are declining from a late December peak. Adam Winsor/Flickr cc The CDC said ventilation, alongside vaccination and practicing good hand hygiene, is one of the core strategies for protecting people against respiratory illness. "People can still get sick after ventilating a space, so it is important to use ventilation as one part of a multi-layered approach to protect ourselves against getting sick from respiratory viruses," the CDC said. Steps for improving ventilation are useful year-round, but are especially helpful when virus levels are high in the community, when people are exposed, sick, or recovering, or when people have risk factors for severe illness, the agency added. Tips for optimizing HVAC systems, adding other steps The guidance emphasizes the importance of bringing in fresh outdoor air and ensuring that air conditioning and heating systems are operating properly, preferably with filters rated MERV-13 or higher. It also describes other steps that can be added, including air circulation, proper exhaust venting, air cleaners, and ultraviolet air treatment. The CDC also said portable carbon dioxide monitors can help determine the staleness or freshness of indoor air. "If possible, move activities outdoors to lower the risk of virus transmission," the CDC said. Chick-Fil-A to modify its policy on antibiotic use News brief Chris Dall, MA Topics Antimicrobial Stewardship Althom / iStock Fast-food chain Chick-Fil-A says a change is coming to its policy on antibiotic use in its chicken supply. In a statement issued over the weekend, Chick-Fil-A says it will shift its policy this spring from No Antibiotics Ever to No Antibiotics Important to Human Medicine. That means the company will allow its chicken suppliers to use antibiotics intended for animals to treat sick birds and flocks but will not allow the use of antibiotics that are also used in human medicine. A Chick-Fil-A official told the Associated Press that the decision reflects concerns about the company's ability to acquire a sufficient supply of antibiotic-free chickens. A consumer-driven shift Chick-Fil-A is one of several fast-food chains that, along with the country's biggest poultry producers, have made the move to antibiotic-free chicken in response to consumer pressure over the past decade. Use of medically important antibiotics in poultry production has significantly fallen during that period. According to the most recent report from the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Veterinary Medicine, poultry accounted for only 2% of medically important antibiotic sales in 2022. Antibiotic stewardship advocates argue that widespread use of medically important antibiotics in food-producing animals is contributing to the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance. In July 2023, Tyson Foods made a similar announcement, saying it was dropping its No Antibiotics Ever label from some of its chicken products and would use a new label clarifying that its chickens are not given medically important antibiotics. The company said it made that decision because it was reintroducing ionophores, which are not considered medically important antibiotics, into its chickens' diets. People more often are origin of infectious diseases in animals than vice versa, data suggest News brief Mary Van Beusekom, MS Topics Misc Emerging Topics Alex Beattie / Flickr cc People pass twice as many viruses to domestic and wild animals than animals pass to people, concludes a study today in Nature Ecology & Evolution. University College London (UCL) researchers analyzed genomic data on nearly 12 million viruses in 32 viral families using network and evolutional analyses to characterize the mutations behind recent vertebrate species jumps. Most emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases are caused by viruses that circulate naturally in nonhuman vertebrates. "When these viruses cross over into humans, they can cause disease outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics," they authors wrote. "While zoonotic host jumps have been extensively studied from an ecological perspective, little attention has gone into characterizing the evolutionary drivers and correlates underlying these events." Viral strains that jump species had to mutate more About twice as many species jumps were inferred to be from people to animals rather than the other way round, a pattern consistent across most viral families. "We further observe that the extent of adaptation associated with a host jump is lower for viruses with broader host ranges," they wrote. "Finally, we show that the genomic targets of natural selection associated with host jumps vary across different viral families, with either structural or auxiliary genes being the prime targets of selection." The genomic targets of natural selection associated with host jumps vary across different viral families, with either structural or auxiliary genes being the prime targets of selection. In a UCL news release, lead author Cedric Tan, a PhD student at the UCL Genetics Institute, said, "When animals catch viruses from humans, this can not only harm the animal and potentially pose a conservation threat to the species, but it may also cause new problems for humans by impacting food security if large numbers of livestock need to be culled to prevent an epidemic, as has been happening over recent years with the H5N1 bird flu strain." "Additionally, if a virus carried by humans infects a new animal species, the virus might continue to thrive even if eradicated among humans, or even evolve new adaptations before it winds up infecting humans again," he added. Study: Long COVID affects 8% of those with COVID-19, is more common in women News brief Stephanie Soucheray, MA Topics COVID-19 brizmaker / iStock New national data in France reveals that, by the World Health Organization (WHO) definition, the prevalence of long COVID is 4.0% in the French population overall and 8.0% among people who had COVID-19. Among the 8.0%, the prevalence varied from 5.3% in men who had COVID-19, to 14.9% among the unemployed, and 18.6% of those with a history of hospitalization for COVID-19. The study is published in Clinical Microbiology and Infection. The study is based on a cross-sectional survey of 10,615 participants conducted in August through November 2022. The WHO defines long COVID as "continuation or development of new symptoms 3 months after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, with these symptoms lasting for at least 2 months with no other explanation." A total of 5,781 (54.5%) of study participants reported ever having a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among those with lasting symptoms, fatigue was the most common, followed by sleep disorders, anxiety, and joint pain. According to the WHO definition, long COVID prevalence was 4.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6% to 4.5%) in the overall population. Prevalence twice as high in women "Prevalence was more than twice as high in women than in men and 68% higher in unemployed people; it was two to three times lower among elderly participants and lower among participants living alone," the authors wrote. Prevalence was more than twice as high in women than in men and 68% higher in unemployed people. Prevalence dropped to 2.4% when the WHO definition was strengthened with requiring at least moderate impact on daily activities (95% CI, 2.1% to 2.8%), and dropped further to 1.2% when the definition included only participants reporting strong or very strong impact of symptoms on daily activities. More than half of those with WHO-defined long COVID were infected during the Delta wave, but the authors said ongoing surveillance of long COVID should take place. "Long COVID and especially the forms with a strong impact on daily activities will continue to represent a significant burden for the societies and healthcare systems of most countries, thus warranting ongoing surveillance," they concluded.

However, the government continually monitors and assesses pandemic threats and prepares for one. The Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT) is used to assess the potential pandemic risk. Overview It is impossible to predict when the next pandemic will occur or its impact. There are ongoing efforts by the Federal Government to monitor and assess pandemic threats and prepare for an influenza pandemic. Novel influenza A viruses with pandemic potential include Asian lineage avian influenza A (H5N1) and (H7N9) viruses. These viruses have all been evaluated using the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT) to assess their potential pandemic risk. Because we cannot predict how bad a future pandemic will be, advance planning is needed at the national, state and local level. Whether the planning is for a government entity, a business, school, a community-based organization, or health care system, all planning efforts should take into consider multiple scenarios of a pandemic (e.g. moderate, severe, or very severe) so that they can be ready to respond quickly and take the appropriate measures to continue daily operations.

Officials with the Texas Animal Health Commission confirmed the flu virus is the Type A H5N1 strain, known for decades to cause outbreaks in birds and to occasionally infect people. The virus is affecting older dairy cows in those states and in New Mexico, causing decreased lactation and low appetite. It comes a week after officials in Minnesota announced that goats on a farm where there had been an outbreak of bird flu among poultry were diagnosed with the virus. It’s believed to be the first time bird flu — also known as highly pathogenic avian influenza — was found in U.S. livestock. READ MORE: Cambodia reports country’s first avian flu death of 2024 The commercial milk supply is safe and risk to people is low, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Dairies are required to only allow milk from healthy animals to enter the food supply, and milk from the sick animals is being diverted or destroyed. Pasteurization also kills viruses and other bacteria, and the process is required for milk sold through interstate commerce, the agency said. “At this stage, there is no concern about the safety of the commercial milk supply or that this circumstance poses a risk to consumer health,” the USDA said in a statement. The federal government said its tests in the cattle did not detect any changes to the virus that would make it spread more easily to people. Dairy farmers in Texas first became concerned three weeks ago when cattle started falling ill with what officials called “mystery dairy cow disease,” Texas Department of Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said. Milk production fell sharply and the cows were lethargic and weren’t eating much. “We hadn’t seen anything like it before,” he said. “It was kind of like they had a cold.” The state’s animal health commission began an investigation that included tests for bird flu, spokeswoman Erin Robinson said. Based on findings from Texas, USDA officials think the cows got the virus from infected wild birds. Experts say livestock appear to recover on their own within seven to 10 days. That’s different than bird flu outbreaks in poultry, which necessitate killing flocks to get rid of the virus. Since 2022, outbreaks have affected about 82 million wild and commercial birds in the U.S. So far, the virus appears to be infecting about 10% of lactating dairy cows in the affected herds, said Michael Payne, a food animal veterinarian and and biosecurity expert with the University of California-Davis Western Institute for Food Safety and Security. “This doesn’t look anything like the high-path influenza in bird flocks,” he said. Bird flu was detected in unpasteurized, clinical samples of milk from sick cattle collected from two dairy farms in Kansas and one in Texas. The virus was also found in a nose and throat swab from another dairy in Texas. Officials called it a rapidly evolving situation. The Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are involved, along with officials in the three states. Another dairy-heavy state, Iowa, said it is monitoring the situation. Dairy industry officials said that producers have started enhanced biosecurity efforts on U.S. farms, including limiting the amount of traffic into and out of properties and restricting visits to employees and essential personnel. Bird flu previously has been reported in 48 different mammal species, Payne noted, adding: “It was probably only a matter of time before avian influenza made its way to ruminants.” Left: A cow looks up from its feed at the Johann Dairy farm in Fresno, California, U.S., Sept. 10, 2020.

LUBBOCK — Cows in the Texas Panhandle have tested positive for the bird flu, another blow to the Texas dairy industry following historic wildfires that killed at least 7,000 livestock. The discovery, reported at two different dairies, is believed to be the first time the disease was found in livestock, researchers say. Strains of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza, commonly known as the bird flu, were confirmed Monday by the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. The state agriculture department is also monitoring the outbreak. Similar outbreaks have been reported at dairies in Kansas and New Mexico. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said there is no safety concern to the commercial milk supply. Consumer health is also not at risk, the department said. The milk from impacted animals is being dumped or destroyed and will not enter the food supply. “In the rare event that some affected milk enters the food chain, the pasteurization process will kill the virus,” said Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller. The dairy industry is critical for the state. With about 292 dairies and an estimated 625,000 cows, Texas ranks fourth in the U.S. when it comes to milk production, and contributes roughly $50 billion to the state’s economy. In the Panhandle, also known as Cattle Country, more than 1.3 billion gallons of milk are produced each year, according to data from the Texas Association of Dairymen. The highest rates of production are in Hartley, Castro and Moore counties. According to the Texas Animal Health Commission, the disease is causing a decrease in milk production as well as thicker, colostrum-like milk and cows have less of an appetite. The disease is also severely impacting older cows and cows in mid-lactation. Infected herds are expected to lose up to 40% of their milk production for 7-10 days until they recover from their symptoms, Miller said. On average, about 10% of each affected herd appears to be infected. The USDA did not specify if any cows have died from the disease. And experts say it can be difficult to track as dairies are also culling cattle for other reasons. Milk loss from infected cows is “too limited” to have a major impact on supply. “There should be no impact on the price of milk or other dairy products,” the USDA said in a statement. Multiple agencies are working fast to monitor the affected herds and conduct additional testing. The disease moves quickly from bird to bird, but experts say the disease is uncommon for dairy herds. “We have never seen avian influenza in dairy cows before,” said Erin Supak, director of communications for the animal health commission. “So we’re encouraging best management practices and enhanced biosecurity measures to be put in place and ensure the spread is not going to go farther than it already has.” According to the USDA, the disease appears to have been introduced to the herds by deceased wild birds. The conclusion comes after farms reported finding the dead birds on their properties. The animal health commission is working with the federal agriculture department and the Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory, as well as other agencies, to continue evaluating the situation. Experts are recommending to limit the number of people coming into dairies to employees and essential workers only, and to use biosecurity resources. Supak says there are other signs for dairy producers to watch for including abnormal, tacky feces, low appetite and fever. Dairy farmers and veterinarians are encouraged to report cattle illnesses to the USDA, state animal health commission or the Texas A&M lab, as the situation is ongoing. Initial testing by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories show the current risk to the public is low, as no changes in the virus have made it more transmissible to humans.

Given the global impact of H9N2 AIV on poultry health, identifying effective treatments is crucial. Methods: To assess the impact of cecropin AD, we conducted in vivo experiments involving 108 5-week-old chickens divided into control, infected, and various treatment groups based on cecropin AD dosage levels (high, medium, and low). The methodologies included hemagglutination (HA) tests for viral titers, histopathological examination and toluidine blue (TB) staining for lung pathology, real-time PCR for viral detection, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for measuring serum levels of inflammatory markers. Results: The findings revealed that cecropin AD substantially reduced lung pathology and viral load, especially at higher dosages, comparing favorably with the effects seen from conventional treatments. Moreover, cecropin AD effectively modulated mast cell activity and the levels of inflammatory markers such as IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and 5-HT, indicating its potential to diminish inflammation and viral spread. Discussion: Cecropin AD presents a significant potential as an alternative treatment for H9N2 AIV in chickens, as evidenced by its ability to lessen lung damage, decrease viral presence, and adjust immune responses. This positions cecropin AD as a promising candidate for further exploration in the management of H9N2 AIV infections in poultry. 1 Introduction The H9N2 subtype of avian influenza virus (AIV), a low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI), poses a significant threat to the global poultry industry. While not typically causing mass mortality, it adversely affects poultry productivity and can pave the way for secondary infections by opportunistic pathogens like Escherichia coli (1). The growing resistance to conventional antiviral drugs, coupled with their adverse side effects and potential for harmful residues, underscores the urgent need for innovative treatment approaches (2). Furthermore, the efficacy of existing H9N2 AIV vaccines is being undermined by viral antigenic variation (3), highlighting the limitations of current strategies in managing this virus. In the pathogenesis of avian influenza, particularly the H9N2 subtype, inflammatory responses play a pivotal role. The cytokines TNF-α and IL-6, along with interferon-γ (IFN-γ), are crucial in modulating these responses. TNF-α is known for its potent proinflammatory activities, including the activation of macrophages and lymphocytes, which are essential for combating viral infections. However, its overproduction can lead to detrimental effects such as tissue injury and dysregulated immune responses (4). Interestingly, studies indicate that the production of TNF-α and IL-6 can negatively regulate each other, suggesting a complex interplay in controlling the immune response (5). In the case of avian influenza A/H7N9, for instance, elevated levels of IL-6 and other proinflammatory cytokines have been associated with severe lung injury and less effective viral clearance, highlighting their contribution to the pathogenesis (6). Similarly, IFN-γ, though commonly elevated following influenza virus infection, has been shown to suppress protective innate lymphoid cell group II (ILC2) function, potentially exacerbating the infection. This points to a nuanced role of IFN-γ in influenza pathogenesis, where its regulation might be a key target for post-infection therapy (7). Mast cells (MC) and 5-HT also significantly contribute to the inflammatory landscape and tissue damage control during infection (8). Recognizing the crucial role of inflammatory responses in H9N2 avian influenza pathogenesis, it is essential to target these processes for effective treatment. Cecropin AD, a representative of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), presents a novel approach. It not only exerts direct antiviral effects but also potentially modulates inflammatory responses. This dual function positions AMPs, known for their broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, low toxicity, and reduced risk of drug resistance (9, 10), as promising candidates in the quest for innovative treatments, particularly in light of the limited efficacy of existing antiviral drugs and vaccines. Among AMPs, insect-derived peptides like cecropins and defensins are the most diverse and widely applied (11). Insects utilize unique immune responses to fend off microbial pathogens, thanks to their vast diversity and formidable defense mechanisms. Cecropin, the first insect-derived AMP, was discovered by inducing silk moth pupae with E. coli and Serratia marcescens, marking a significant milestone in AMP research (12, 13). Cecropin AD, a hybrid peptide derived from cecropin A and cecropin D (14), is at the forefront of our study due to its remarkable antimicrobial, antiviral, and anti-tumor activities without cytotoxic effects (15, 16). Its effectiveness against various pathogens, including superior antimicrobial efficacy compared to its individual components, positions it as a low-risk, promising alternative for treating poultry diseases (17). This study specifically aims to investigate the therapeutic potential of cecropin AD in treating H9N2 AIV in chickens, exploring a novel avenue in avian influenza management. We hypothesize that cecropin AD can effectively reduce the viral load and mitigate the symptoms associated with H9N2 infection. To test this hypothesis, we will examine lung tissue slices, assess lung indices, and measure viral loads, mast cell (MC) numbers and degranulation, as well as changes in major inflammatory factors. Through this research, we aspire to provide crucial theoretical data on the antiviral action of cecropin AMPs and offer insights for developing novel anti-influenza drugs, which could be pivotal in addressing the challenges posed by H9N2 AIV in the poultry industry. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Ethics approval and consent to participate All animal work in this study met the minimum standards of animal welfare as described in the International Guiding Principles for Biomedical Research involving Animals (at https://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/Guiding_Principles_2012.pdf). The handling of birds was performed in accordance with the Guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee and approved by the Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine (Permit number: BUA2022070). All efforts were made to alleviate animal suffering and to improve their quality of life. 2.2 Materials and animals preparation In this study, 108 5 weeks-old SPF White Leghorn chickens were acquired from Beijing Boehringer Ingelheim Vetsuisse Ltd. The cecropin AD (Q/DXN 063–2021), a key investigational compound, was sourced from Viteling Antibiotic-Free Breeding Technology (China). Additionally, we used oseltamivir phosphate capsules as a western medicine positive control agent. These were obtained from Yichang East Sunshine Changjiang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. The experimental study also involved the low pathogenicity avian influenza virus (LPAIV) H9N2 subtype, identified by the GenBank accession numbers FJ499463-FJ499470, obtained from the China Agricultural University and propagated in 11 days-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs. 2.3 Experimental design and drug administration After a week of acclimatization, the chickens were allocated into six groups: three cecropin AD dosage groups (10 mg/bird/day, 20 mg/bird/day, and 40 mg/bird/day), a virus control group, a blank control group, and a positive control group treated with oseltamivir phosphate (0.39 mg/bird/day). Each group comprised 18 chickens and was housed in separate units within an SPF aviary, ensuring uninterrupted access to feed and water. The dosages of cecropin AD, oseltamivir phosphate, and the H9N2 AIV virus were carefully determined based on preliminary experiments conducted in our laboratory. These preliminary studies were critical in optimizing the therapeutic effects and safety, ensuring the virus dosage could induce significant but non-lethal illness in the chickens. During the infection phase, we administered the H9N2 AIV virus to the experimental groups. The virus, cultivated in the allantoic cavity of embryonated eggs, was given in a dose of 0.2 mL per chicken, using nasal and ocular drops. The negative control group received the same volume of physiological saline in a similar manner. Three days post-infection, treatment commenced with the designated dosages of cecropin AD for the respective groups and oseltamivir phosphate for the pharmaceutical control group. Concurrently, the virus and negative control groups were administered the same volume of physiological saline daily. Throughout the experiment, the physiological and behavioral parameters of the chickens, including alertness, weight, feed intake, respiration, and movement, were closely monitored to evaluate the effects of the treatments and the infection. 2.4 Sample collection and procedure Three, six, and nine days post-infection, five chickens from each group were randomly selected for analysis. In strict adherence to ethical standards for animal research, these selected chickens were humanely euthanized, followed by anatomical pathology observations. Subsequently, tissue and organ samples were collected and weighed. Notably, for the purpose of this study, the lung coefficients were calculated using the weight of a single (unilateral) lung, reflective of standard practices in avian histopathological research. After the unilateral lung was weighed, the tissues were rinsed with physiological saline and preserved in a 10% polyformaldehyde solution for future histological analysis, while the remaining lung tissue samples were stored at −80°C for total RNA and protein extractions. For the calculation of the lung coefficient (LC), we meticulously adhered to the following formula, ensuring accuracy in our measurements: Lung coefficient L C = Unilateral wet lung weight g Body weight g × 100 % 2.5 Histological analysis and mast cell evaluation in lung tissues Lung tissue samples from chickens were fixed in a 4% formaldehyde solution for 4 h and subsequently cut into 0.5 cm3 pieces, followed by a 3–4 h rinse. The tissue then underwent a dehydration process involving an hour-long water wash and graded ethanol immersions (30 min in 75% alcohol, 20 min in 80% ethanol, followed by 20 min in 95% ethanol, with the 95% ethanol step repeated four times). After drying, the samples were cleared in a xylene and ethanol mixture, embedded in wax, and sectioned into thin layers of 4 to 6 microns for histological examination. The sections were dewaxed using xylene baths and ethanol immersions, rinsed in distilled water, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for general histology. For mast cell visualization, sections underwent toluidine blue staining after acidification with hydrochloric acid for 10 min and a thorough rinse. Toluidine blue solution was applied for 40 min, followed by rinsing and air-drying. Sections were then sealed on glass slides with neutral resin and labeled for analysis. Mast cells were quantified using the Case Viewer image analysis system, with the degranulation rate calculated as the number of degranulated mast cells divided by the total mast cell count, multiplied by 100%. This process facilitated a detailed comparison of pathological changes in the lung tissues at various time points, providing insights into the inflammatory response within the lung tissues. 2.6 Lung tissue total RNA extraction and real-time quantitative PCR Total RNA was extracted from 30–50 mg of chicken lung tissue using TRIzol reagent (Takara, Dalian, China), as per the guidelines provided in the manufacturer’s instructions (18). The lung tissue was initially ground into a grayish-white powder in a mortar with liquid nitrogen. The concentration and purity of the extracted RNA were determined using a Nanodrop 2000C spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States), ensuring an appropriate A260/280 absorbance ratio. cDNA synthesis was conducted using the PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (Takara, Dalian, China). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analyses were performed on the CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States), with the following thermal cycling conditions: an initial denaturation at 95°C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 10 s and annealing/extension at a specified temperature for 30 s, accompanied by fluorescence signal acquisition (as detailed in Table 1). Melt curve analysis was conducted within a temperature range of 65–95°C. Amplification efficiencies for the target genes were maintained between 95 and 105%. The qPCR reaction mix comprised 10 μL TB GreenTM Premix (Takara), 0.4 μL of each forward and reverse primer, 1.5 μL cDNA, and 7.7 μL DNase/RNase-Free Deionized Water (Tiangen, Beijing, China). All samples were analyzed in triplicate, with cycle threshold (Ct) values normalized against β-actin expression levels. Relative mRNA levels were quantified using the 2−ΔΔCt method (19). Table 1 Table 1. Primers used for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). 2.7 Statistical analysis Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with GraphPad Prism version 8.3 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) and SPSS 20 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, United States). Experimental results are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Tukey’s post hoc test was applied for pairwise comparisons among treatment groups. The equation ΔCt = mean value of target gene − mean value of internal reference gene was utilized, with ΔΔCt = ΔCt − mean value of control group. A p-value less than 0.05 was deemed statistically significant. 3 Results 3.1 Effects of H9N2 avian influenza infection and cecropin AD treatment on body weight After infection with H9N2 avian influenza, the chickens exhibited symptoms including ruffled feathers, lethargy, and changes in water and feed intake. Following treatment with CAD, a gradual improvement was observed. Following virus infection, the rate and amount of weight gain in the virus group were significantly lower than those in the blank control group (p < 0.001). After CAD treatment, the issue of slow weight gain gradually alleviated, showing a dose-dependent effect. Significant differences were observed in the CAD high-dose group and the positive control group compared to the virus-infected group (p < 0.001, Figure 1A). Figure 1 Figure 1. Body weight trends and lung pathology in chickens following H9N2 AIV infection and CAD treatment. (A) Bar graph representing body weight changes in chickens across different experimental groups, illustrating the impact of H9N2 infection and subsequent cecropin AD treatment on growth rates. (B) Multiple bar graph depicting lung coefficients at 3, 6, and 9 days post-infection across groups. (C–H) Histological examination of lung tissues from six study groups, revealing the extent of pulmonary congestion and structural changes following H9N2 infection and treatment. Congestion, mucus presence, and inflammatory infiltrates are evidenced with increasing clarity over the course of treatment, with significant reductions in pathology in the cecropin AD high-dose and positive control groups. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and the mean ± S.D. (n = 3 or 6) is shown. p-values were determined by non-parametric one-way ANOVA. Compared with virus group *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.005, and ****p < 0.001. Compared with the control group #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, ###p < 0.005, and ####p < 0.005. 3.2 Pathological anatomy observations Dissections revealed significant congestion and mucus in the lungs and trachea of chickens infected with H9N2 avian influenza (Figures 1C–H). Additionally, some chickens showed a reduction in thymus size, pericardial effusion, and liver congestion. The lung coefficient analysis indicated a significant increase in the virus group compared to the control group (p < 0.005). Treatment with cecropin AD and western medicine led to reductions in lung lesions and edema to varying degrees. After 3, 6, and 9 days of treatment, the lung coefficient in the high-dose cecropin AD group and the positive control group treated with western medicine was significantly lower than that in the virus group (p < 0.005, Figure 1B). 3.3 Pathological anatomy observations in lung tissues As shown in Figure 2, 3 days post-infection, the lungs of the H9N2-infected chickens showed significant pathology, including thickened alveolar walls and patchy red blood cell clustering, indicative of congestion and stasis. Inflammatory cell infiltration was extensive in the alveolar interstitium, intensifying with increasing viral titer. Figure 2 Figure 2. Histopathological analysis of lung tissues in chickens following H9N2 AIV infection and CAD treatment (40×). The group designations, noted on the left margin of each row, from top to bottom, include the blank control group, virus group, positive control group, and cecropin AD-treated groups at low, medium, and high doses. The time points post-infection, indicated at the top of each column, are day 3, day 6, and day 9, respectively. Scale bar = 500 μm. Annotations within the image are indicated by arrows of different colors to highlight specific histopathological features: blue arrows point to areas of congestion and stasis; green arrows indicate inflammatory cell infiltration; red arrows mark the thickening of the alveolar walls; and black arrows denote the rupture of alveolar septa. By day 6, lung tissue morphology in the virus group exhibited more severe disruption, with alveolar septa fragmentation and high red blood cell counts, reflecting worsened congestion and stasis. Inflammatory responses intensified, marked by increased neutrophils, lymphocytes, and leukocytes in the alveolar interstitium. On day 9, lung condition improved slightly compared to day 6, with better bronchiole and alveoli integrity and reduced alveolar septal damage. However, severe inflammatory response persisted, with extensive inflammatory cell infiltration in the alveolar septa. Throughout the 3, 6, and 9 days post-treatment period, the virus group consistently displayed lung congestion, stasis, thickened alveolar walls, and extensive inflammatory cell infiltration, albeit with some easing of symptoms by day 9. The cecropin AD and western medicine groups showed similar pathological changes but to a significantly lesser degree than the virus group. The low-dose cecropin AD group exhibited the most severe lung damage among the dosage groups, while the high-dose group demonstrated better pulmonary health. 3.4 Viral expression in lung tissues post-cecropin AD treatment After 3, 6, and 9 days of treatment, the high-dose cecropin AD group exhibited a profoundly lower hemagglutination titer in lung tissue homogenates compared to the virus group (p < 0.01), with no significant difference observed in comparison to the western medicine group (p > 0.05) (Figure 3A). Cecropin AD treatment significantly reduced viral expression within the lung tissues. Following 3, 6, and 9 days of treatment, low, medium, and high dosage groups all showed viral levels significantly reduced from the virus group (p < 0.01). In contrast, the high-dose cecropin AD group after 3 days, as well as the medium and high doses after 6 and 9 days, demonstrated viral expression levels that were comparable to those treated with western medicine (Figure 3B), indicating the efficacy of cecropin AD in diminishing viral load in lung tissues. Figure 3 Figure 3. Hemagglutination titer and viral expression in lung tissues following H9N2 AIV infection and CAD treatment. (A) A graph showing the hemagglutination titer in lung tissue homogenates across various groups. (B) A graph depicting the viral expression levels in lung tissues post-treatment. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and the mean ± S.D. (n = 3) is shown. p-values were determined by non-parametric one-way ANOVA. Compared with virus group *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01. Compared with the control group #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01. 3.5 Mast cell observations in chicken lung tissue post-cecropin AD treatment After toluidine blue (TB) staining, mast cells (MCs) were distinctly identified in chicken lung tissues, with a notable concentration of MCs observed around the tracheal areas, as highlighted by black arrows in Figure 4. This observation indicates a specific distribution pattern in response to the infection, with mast cells prominently aggregating in regions likely to be affected by viral activity. The images serve as a visual representation of the variations in MC concentration and activity across different experimental groups and time points, illustrating both the spatial distribution and the physiological response of these cells to the H9N2 avian influenza virus. Figure 4 Figure 4. H9N2 AIV infection and CAD treatment: toluidine blue stained paraffin sections of chicken lung tissues (40×). The group designations, noted on the left margin of each row, from top to bottom, include the blank control group, virus group, positive control group, and cecropin AD-treated groups at low, medium, and high doses. The time points post-infection, indicated at the top of each column, are day 3, day 6, and day 9, respectively. Scale bar =500 μm. Furthermore, detailed examination of these stained sections under higher magnification revealed evidence of mast cell degranulation, a process indicative of an active immune response to the infection. Degranulation, characterized by the release of granules from the mast cells, was evident in areas with high MC concentrations, particularly in proximity to the tracheal regions. This degranulation process, while not captured at the initial magnification, underscores the dynamic role of mast cells in mediating inflammatory responses within the lung tissues. Cecropin AD treatment significantly affected the number and degranulation rate of mast cells (MCs). As shown in Figure 5, compared to the control group, there was a significant increase in the number of MCs and their degranulation rate following viral infection (p < 0.01). After 3, 6, and 9 days of treatment, the high-dose cecropin AD group exhibited notably lower MC counts compared to the virus group (p < 0.05), consistent with results observed in the western medicine group (Figure 5A). Furthermore, both medium and high doses of cecropin AD demonstrated reduced MC degranulation rates after 6 and 9 days of treatment (p < 0.05), with a marked decrease observed in the high-dose group by day 9 (p < 0.01). These changes were similar to those observed in the western medicine group (Figure 5B). Figure 5 Figure 5. Variations in mast cell counts and degranulation rates in lung tissues following H9N2 AIV infection and CAD treatment. (A) The count of mast cells (MCs) in the lung tissues of chickens across different groups. (B) The degranulation rate of mast cells (MCs) in the lung tissues of chickens across various groups. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and the mean ± S.D. (n = 6) is shown. p-values were determined by non-parametric one-way ANOVA. Compared with virus group *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01. Compared with the control group #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01. 3.6 Cecropin AD suppression of inflammatory factor expression in chicken lungs Cecropin AD treatment markedly influenced the levels of several key inflammatory factors in the chicken lungs. Both medium and high doses significantly reduced IL-6 levels after 6 and 9 days of treatment compared to the virus group (p < 0.01), with the medium dose showing similar efficacy to western medicine (p > 0.05, Figure 6A). Across all doses, cecropin AD substantially decreased TNF-α levels after 3, 6, and 9 days of treatment (p < 0.01), with the high dose achieving results comparable to western medicine (p > 0.05, Figure 6B). Notably, the high dose of cecropin AD significantly reduced IFN-γ levels after 3 days of treatment, on par with the western medicine group (p > 0.05, Figure 6C). Furthermore, high and medium doses of cecropin AD were effective in significantly lowering 5-HT levels after 3, 6, and 9 days (p < 0.01), with the high dose mirroring the efficacy of western medicine (p > 0.05, Figure 6D).

Compared with the control group #p < 0.05 and ##p < 0.01. 4 Discussion Our study’s investigation into CAD efficacy against H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV) in chickens corroborates and expands upon existing antiviral peptide research. We observed a significant reduction in lung pathology and viral load in CAD-treated groups, echoing previous findings and highlighting CAD’s potential in treating respiratory viral infections (20). The dose-dependent decrease in viral replication in lung tissues is especially relevant given H9N2 AIV’s rapid mutation rate, which poses challenges to conventional treatments. Furthermore, the modulation of key inflammatory markers, such as IL-6 and TNF-α (21), in our study aligns with the documented anti-inflammatory effects of similar peptides (22). These findings endorse CAD’s therapeutic potential in managing viral-induced inflammation and add to the evidence supporting antimicrobial peptides as alternatives to traditional antiviral therapies (23, 24), especially in the context of increasing drug resistance and safety concerns. Our in-depth investigation of cecropin AD’s (CAD) mechanisms against H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV) delineates its multifaceted approach. The observed significant reduction in viral load, particularly with higher doses, implicates CAD’s efficacy in either disrupting viral structures or hindering replication (25). Moreover, CAD’s role in attenuating lung pathology and diminishing inflammatory cytokines underscores its capacity for modulating immune responses (16, 26). This dual functionality, adeptly balancing antiviral and immunomodulatory actions, is essential in managing infections where excessive inflammation is detrimental. Our study further highlights the criticality of dose optimization in CAD’s therapeutic application, evidenced by the pronounced dose-dependent effects. Precise dosage is key to achieving an optimal therapeutic balance, especially in the poultry industry, where safety and efficacy of treatment are of utmost concern (27). CAD’s versatility in reducing viral replication and modulating inflammatory responses earmarks it as a potential agent for broader applications in poultry health and possibly in human therapeutics (25). This investigation into cecropin AD’s (CAD) efficacy against H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV) in chickens offers crucial insights for poultry health management and broader public health considerations. CAD’s notable impact in reducing viral load, alleviating lung pathology, and modulating inflammatory responses underscores its potential as an effective intervention against avian diseases. The significance of these findings becomes particularly pertinent in light of ongoing challenges in managing AIV outbreaks, which bear substantial economic and health ramifications for the poultry sector. CAD’s role in diminishing the economic impact of AIV infections and enhancing overall poultry health is commendable. Beyond avian health, the implications of this study extend to a wider context. The antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties of CAD underscore the potential of antimicrobial peptides in addressing various viral infections, particularly amidst concerns regarding drug-resistant strains and the quest for safe and effective antiviral agents. Future research avenues that warrant exploration include delving deeper into CAD’s mechanisms of action, its safety profile, and the potential for resistance development. In sum, our findings contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting the use of antimicrobial peptides like CAD in managing viral infections, offering a novel dual-action strategy against both viral replication and inflammation for broader therapeutic applications. However, our study is not without its limitations. While focusing on chickens provides valuable initial data, it restricts the findings’ applicability to other species. The controlled laboratory settings may not entirely mimic the natural environments where AIV is prevalent. The sample size, adequate for preliminary investigations, necessitates enlargement in subsequent studies to enhance robustness. Furthermore, the long-term effects and potential resistance development against CAD have not yet been addressed, which are critical aspects for understanding its enduring efficacy and practical utility. Future studies should broaden the scope to include diverse avian species and field trials, enabling a more comprehensive evaluation of CAD’s effectiveness. Investigating CAD’s role in co-infection scenarios, common in poultry settings, and elucidating its molecular mechanisms are vital for optimizing its application and developing improved formulations. Additionally, exploring CAD’s application in human medicine, especially for respiratory viruses, presents a fascinating avenue for research. Our study establishes a groundwork for further exploration into cecropin AD’s role as an antiviral agent, with the goal of fully harnessing its capabilities in managing viral infections in both veterinary and potentially human contexts. 5 Conclusion Our study highlights the significant role of cecropin AD in mitigating lung damage and pulmonary edema caused by H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV) in chickens. Cecropin AD effectively inhibits H9N2 AIV replication in the lungs and modulates key serum cytokines including IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and 5-HT. This modulation results in a notable reduction of the inflammatory response, leading to a significant antiviral effect. These findings demonstrate cecropin AD’s potential in preserving respiratory health in avian species, showcasing its efficacy as both a therapeutic and a potential preventive measure against viral respiratory infections.

Sandra Levy 3/25/2024 facebooktwitterlinkedInemail CSL Seqirus, a global company specialzing in the protection of public health, confirmed it is fully prepared to deliver its influenza vaccine portfolio for the 2024/25 U.S. season, based on the trivalent strains recommended by the Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. During the meeting, the committee confirmed the viral strain selection of influenza vaccines for the Northern Hemisphere 2024/25 season, which aligns with the February 2024 World Health Organization annual recommendations and is unchanged from the Southern Hemisphere 2024 season."CSL Seqirus applauds the VRBPAC's commitment to providing a clear, evidence-backed recommendation to the FDA so that the composition of seasonal influenza vaccines for the upcoming season will be formulated to match projected circulating strains, based on the WHO's ongoing surveillance," said Gregg Sylvester, chief health officer and head of medical affairs at CSL Seqirus. "In addition to implementing this change, we are committed to working with our partners in public health to reverse the alarming decline in immunization rates and vaccine confidence that we have seen over the past two flu seasons."The VRBPAC's recommendation follows the October 2023 VRBPAC meeting, where the committee strongly supported the WHO's recommendation to expeditiously remove the B/Yamagata influenza virus strain from quadrivalent influenza vaccines and transition to trivalent influenza vaccines for the 2024/25 season. The recommendation was grounded in data from the WHO's global influenza response and surveillance system, which detected a decline in B/Yamagata circulation before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and no further circulation of B/Yamagata lineage viruses since March of 2020.[Read more: Walgreens releases 2023-2024 flu index]The strain selection for the 2024/25 influenza season reflects the removal of B/Yamagata and it will not be included in the vaccines manufactured and delivered by CSL Seqirus. CSL Seqirus worked closely with the FDA during 2023 to align on a path forward and is fully prepared to transition its complete portfolio of seasonal influenza vaccines in the U.S. market from quadrivalent to trivalent formulations for the 2024/25 influenza season. CSL Seqirus completed its transition plan for the 2024/2025 season by December 2023 and regulatory and manufacturing teams are on track to convert the full U.S. portfolio. As a result of this effort, CSL Seqirus received FDA approval on March 4, 2024 for all of its U.S. trivalent influenza vaccines. "This strain consistency across hemispheres will support both speed and efficiency, as CSL Seqirus has experience manufacturing these recommended strains," said Dave Ross, vice president of North America Commercial Operations at CSL Seqirus.Across the world, CSL Seqirus is collaborating with regulatory bodies and public health authorities on an appropriate transition timeline for each country that aims to ensure a smooth transition, increase vaccine confidence and improve immunization rates.The undetectable circulation of B/Yamagata is a testament to the critical role of widely implemented influenza immunization programs, amongst other contributing factors such as the inherent characteristics and epidemiology of the B/Yamagata virus and the unique environment created by the COVID-19 pandemic, the company said.[Read more: Retailers remind consumers to get flu, COVID shots, testing] Related Topics PHARMACY Immunizations News Related ArticlesSanofi Pasteur presents influenza vaccine trial dataFDA approves emergency use of a test for A(H1N1) influenzaWalgreens, local Chicago healthcare provider partner on 5,000 free flu shot vouchers for those in need X This ad will auto-close in 10 seconds Stay Informed Get the Newsletter Subscribe Get the Magazine Subscribe FacebooklinkedInTwitterYoutubeInstagram Print SubscriptionAdvertisePrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceContactEditorial Advisory BoardReprints/Reuse Â© 2024 EnsembleIQ, All Rights ReservedDo college students and teens need a flu shot? - HealthyChildren.org You may be trying to access this site from a secured browser on the server.

Tips & Tools Question Do college students and teens need a flu shot? Flor Muñoz, MD, MSc, FAAP Answer Article Main Image Page Content​Yes. A flu shot is especially important this year, and they should get their COVID-19 shot or booster dose, too. You may have heard of recent flu outbreaks on college campuses. Flu viruses are known to spread quickly among college students and teens. Group social activities, crowded classrooms and shared living spaces make it easier for the flu to be passed around to others. If you are a college student or the par​ent of a college student or teen, be sure that they get their flu vaccine as soon as possible. Can't they get their shot at home during the school break?Don't wait. It is not possible to know when flu season will get into full swing. Also, it takes a couple of weeks to develop full protection after vaccination. That's why it is best to be fully vaccinated before the season starts. Flu vaccination is the best way to prevent flu from spreading, which is why their best bet is to get the flu shot before traveling. Most college health clinics offer influenza vaccine for students. For college students, a flu vaccine and a COVID-19 vaccine are recommended this season. You can receive a flu shot and a COVID-19 shot at the same visit. COVID-19 vaccination will not protect against flu. All eligible teens and college students are encouraged to get the COVID-19 vaccine and flu vaccine. Both vaccines are recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, and they can be given at the same time safely. Isn't it too late to get a flu shot? Flu activity often starts in October, peaks in February and can last into May. This season, it is not likely that flu activity will be as low as it was during the pandemic. Experts think that the number of people with flu was so low because of the strict COVID-19 prevention measures. This year, the influenza virus is expected to circulate among people and cause disease, just like other respiratory viruses have done since the summer. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is already investigating several reports of flu outbreaks involving a strain of influenza A virus, including at college campuses in several states. The flu vaccine protects against four flu virus strains, including an influenza A virus strain that is like the strain linked to these outbreaks. What about antiviral drugs?If someone is sick with the flu, antivirals can help shorten their illness. But antiviral drugs are a second line of defense that can be used to treat flu if you get sick. They are not a substitute for getting a flu vaccine. Anyone who has a higher risk of serious illness from the flu should get antivirals right away if they get sick with the flu, regardless of their vaccination status. To be most effective, antiviral drugs must be taken as soon as possible after symptoms start. RememberThe flu vaccine is the best way to help prevent seasonal flu and its potentially serious complications. By getting a flu vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine, college students can help prevent viruses from spreading to others in their community who are most at risk of getting very sick or going to the hospital.

On March 29, 2024, the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) announced that highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has been detected in a dairy cattle herd in Montcalm County, MI. This news came on the heels of a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announcement that the virus had been found in cattle in Texas, Kansas and New Mexico. Farmers report that cattle recover from the virus in about 10 days. According to USDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) pasteurized milk and milk products remain safe for consumption. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, this is the first time that cattle have tested positive for HPAI, and only the second time HPAI has been detected in ruminants—a single goat tested positive earlier this month. Wild migratory birds are believed to be source of infection in the southwest. The infected Michigan herd received healthy cattle from a Texas farm on March 7. A local veterinarian verified that none of the shipped cattle were showing symptoms at the time of transport. Affected dairies reported the following clinical signs: Reduced feed intake, with a simultaneous decrease in rumen motility Reduced milk production Cows experience thicker, concentrated, colostrum-like milk that may be discolored (yellow to brown) Abnormal, tacky or loose manure Low grade fever Producers who notice these signs in their herd should contact their veterinarian who can provide treatment recommendations, determine if testing is needed, and coordinate sampling with Michigan State University Veterinary Diagnostic Lab (VDL), MSU Extension dairy experts say that dairy and beef producers should revisit their biosecurity plans and tighten practices to help decrease the risk of disease outbreaks and illness. This includes: Reporting any illness or deaths to your herd veterinarian Minimizing the interaction with wild birds by incorporating management practices for wildlife Cleaning and disinfecting tools and equipment used on farm Isolating and monitoring the health of any new cattle brought onto a farm before introducing them into a new herd Restricting nose-to-nose contact between livestock from other farms Implementing a line of separation by minimizing the entry of vehicles, contaminated equipment, people, wildlife and other domestic animals onto the farm Example biosecurity plans, practices and resources for cattle can be found by visiting the Secure Milk Supply or the Beef Quality Assurance websites. Questions about biosecurity can be directed to MSU Extension educators: Jerad Jaborek, Phil Durst and Cora Okkema. Media questions should be directed to Beth Stuever, MSU Extension director of public affairs. This article was published by Michigan State University Extension.

(March 25, 2024) – The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association (NCBA) is aware that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) confirmed Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in samples collected from dairy cattle in the United States. Importantly, the agency confirmed there is no threat to human health, and milk and meat remains safe to consume. USDA has confirmed that affected dairy cows do not appear to be transmitting the virus to other cattle within the same herd. At present, HPAI has not been detected in beef cattle. However, producers are encouraged to implement enhanced biosecurity measures on their farms and ranches to help protect their herds. For more information on animal health protocols and developing an effective biosecurity plan, cattle farmers and ranchers are encouraged to visit www.bqa.org, and complete or update their certification in Beef Quality Assurance practices. Producers can also visit usda.gov for resources on how to manage wildlife to limit exposure to HPAI. What is Avian Influenza? Detections of avian influenza in birds are common in the United States. While it is uncommon for HPAI to affect mammals, USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has been tracking some limited detections of HPAI in mammalian wildlife for many years in the United States. Cattle producers are encouraged to implement enhanced biosecurity measures in and around farms and ranches to keep their cattle and workforce healthy and the food supply safe.

This caused more severe illnesses in pregnant mice than nonpregnant animals and restricted growth in the newborn animals that continued into adulthood. The findings, published in mBio, offer researchers better insights into the mechanisms behind infection risk during pregnancy and potential avenues for treatments.5“Very little research is ongoing in this area,” said Kristina Adams Waldorf, a reproductive immunologist at the University of Washington who was not affiliated with the study. According to her, the study is a good start to investigating the link between influenza A infections and negative pregnancy outcomes.To study the correlation between pregnancy and viral infection outcomes, Klein and her team infected female mice at ten days into their gestation with the H1N1 strain of influenza virus. They used genetically dissimilar mice to better replicate the genetic heterogeneity of human pregnancies.During influenza infection in mice, both pregnant and nonpregnant animals showed viral clearance, but pregnant mice become sicker as indicated by lower body temperatures and greater weight loss. Additionally, pups born to infected mothers were smaller at birth and reached growth and behavior milestones later than animals born to noninfected mothers. “This got us really thinking that it can't just be that pregnant females can't control the virus because of the dampening of antiviral immunity. There's got to be something else going on,” Klein said. “That's when we started to really explore the placenta.”Continue reading below... NewsPlacental Gene Expression Hints at Preterm BirthRead MoreThe team compared the morphologies of placentas from virally infected mice to those from noninfected animals. They showed that viral infection damaged the placenta and reduced the presence of a placental cell type, trophoblasts. Infection also decreased the levels of cytokines produced by these cells, even though viruses weren’t detected in this tissue. Placentas from infected mice contained proinflammatory cytokines and increased populations of macrophages compared to those from noninfected mice.Normally, gestational hormones such as P4 suppress inflammatory immune activity in the placenta. The team found reduced P4 levels in the placentas from infected mice compared to noninfected mice. “We were really excited, but we didn’t understand how a flu virus in the lungs was causing suppression of progesterone,” Klein said.To explore this, the team investigated a P4 regulating hormone, prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α). They found increased PGF2α in the lungs, blood, and ovaries of infected, pregnant mice compared to the samples from noninfected, pregnant mice. PGF2α is synthesized by cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1). They showed that pregnant, infected mice had increased amounts of COX-1 in their lungs compared to their noninfected counterparts. The team confirmed that the elevated COX-1 in the lungs increased PGF2α in the ovaries by treating infected pregnant mice with a pharmacological inhibitor of COX-1. PGF2α levels dropped, and the circulating P4 levels increased.Finally, the team investigated whether the reduced level of P4 during viral infection contributed to the reduced growth in pups born to infected mothers. They treated pregnant mice with an injectable form of synthetic P4 after infecting them with influenza. Compared to infected, nontreated, pregnant mice, animals that received the synthetic P4 maintained their body temperatures and weight better. Additionally, the pups born to P4-treated mice were larger at birth and met growth and developmental milestones similar to mice born to noninfected mothers.Continue reading below... FeaturesThe Ephemeral Life of the PlacentaRead MoreKlein said that this study provides insights into how respiratory viral infections cause negative maternal and fetal outcomes and how these could be prevented. “What our data suggested is that it isn't about a lack of control of the virus. It's about the placental inflammation,” she said.Adams Waldorf found the findings interesting but would like to see data on how P4 affects the antiviral response in the lung. “This study also opens up the possibility of using synthetic progestins to treat pregnant women who are infected with viruses,” Adams Waldorf said. “However, we do need to be careful that we are not worsening the impact of viral infection on other organs like the lungs.”ReferenceFrivold C, et al.

Published March 27, 2024 Delilah Alvarado Staff Reporter post share post print email license The Moderna headquarters is seen on November 30, 2020 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Maddie Meyer via Getty Images Dive Brief: Blackstone Life Sciences will invest as much as $750 million on influenza vaccine research and development by Moderna, announcing Wednesday a private funding deal that gives the private equity firm rights to future payments and royalties. Moderna has advanced an mRNA-based flu shot into late-stage testing and is also studying a combination flu and COVID-19 vaccine — part of a broad R&D strategy to follow the success of its standalone COVID shot. Later this year, the company intends to submit the flu shot for regulatory approval. The funding agreement comes one day after Moderna revealed results for a “next-gen” COVID vaccine that it said showed higher immune responses than the biotechnology firm’s current product. This next-gen vaccine is being used in the combination flu and COVID vaccine that’s now in Phase 3 testing. Dive Insight: The new trial results and funding were announced alongside a “vaccine day” that Moderna has held for the past five years. The biotech, which was criticized in its early years for investing in vaccine R&D, has now built a large business around infectious disease research. Sales of the company’s widely used COVID-19 shot have fallen sharply, however, pushing the company to invest in its vaccines for flu and respiratory syncytial virus. “Our goal is to launch multiple vaccine products in the next few years and deliver the greatest possible impact to people through mRNA medicines,” said Stéphane Bancel, CEO of Moderna. “Achieving this ambition requires substantial investment in late-stage studies and we are excited to welcome Blackstone and their innovative financing model.” The company’s flu candidate, dubbed mRNA-1010, has delivered mixed results in Phase 3 testing, outperforming existing shots against “A”, but not “B”, strains in one of several trials Moderna has run. Moderna updated the shot’s formula to better address both strains. Overall, Moderna has five vaccines in Phase 3 testing, and another three that it expects to soon advance into late-stage trials for Epstein-Barr virus, Varicella-Zoster virus and norovirus. Moderna predicts the market for flu vaccines will be $7 billion in 2024, while it sees the market for RSV shots growing to $10 billion annually. GSK and Pfizer currently sell RSV vaccines in the U.S. Per the new agreement, Blackstone Life Sciences will receive commercial milestone payments and low-single digit royalties from Moderna on flu vaccine products. The new funding does not change Moderna’s guidance for spending $4.5 billion on R&D this year, the company said. The investment by Blackstone is one of many the firm has made in life sciences, including a similar deal it struck with Sanofi to provide R&D funding for the French company’s multiple myeloma medicine. It has also invested in Autolus Therapeutics, Ferring Pharmaceuticals, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and Anthos Therapeutics. purchase licensing rights Filed Under: Biotech BioPharma Dive news delivered to your inbox Get the free daily newsletter read by industry experts Email: Select Newsletter: Daily Dive M-F Select Newsletter: Commercialization Weekly Every Wednesday Select Newsletter: Gene Therapy Weekly Every Thursday Select Newsletter: Emerging Biotech Weekly Every Tuesday Select user consent: By signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

(Image credit: Ashit Desai/Getty Images) A student in Vietnam has died of H5N1 bird flu, according to the country's Department of Preventive Medicine.The 21-year-old man developed symptoms of fever and a cough on March 11. A week later, he presented at Ninh Hoa Medical Center in Vietnam's eastern Khanh Hoa province, where he was diagnosed with pneumonia and transferred to Khanh Hoa General Hospital.The student tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza on March 20, and further tests conducted two days later at the Nha Trang Pasteur Institute showed the patient was infected with the H5N1 subtype. This strain of bird flu is known to cause deadly outbreaks in wild and domesticated birds and to occasionally infect people. "Due to the serious progression of the disease, the patient died on March 23," representatives of the Department of Health of Tay Ninh Province wrote in a translated statement.An investigation revealed the student, who was enrolled at Nha Trang University, had gone wild bird trapping before and after the Lunar New Year on Feb. 10. However, no sick or dead birds have been reported in the area where he went trapping, close to Ninh Hoa town.Related: Bird flu wipes out over 95% of southern elephant seal pups in 'catastrophic' mass deathSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter nowGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.The student lived with his family in a village near Ninh Hoa. "Cases of close contact with patients are listed and their health monitored daily," representatives wrote in the statement. "To date, no new cases have been detected."Since 2003, 128 people have been infected with H5N1 bird flu in Vietnam, according to the statement, and 65 of these cases resulted in death. Worldwide, there have been more than 880 sporadic human infections across 23 countries in the same time period, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). RELATED STORIES—Highly pathogenic bird flu behind 'unusual deaths in cats' in Poland, WHO says—1st-known 'highly pathogenic' bird flu cases in Antarctic could threaten penguins—'Parrot fever' outbreak in 5 European countries kills 5 peopleThere have been six outbreaks of the virus in poultry flocks in Vietnam since the beginning of 2024, with the country's Ministry of Health warning of the risk of transmission from birds to humans in December 2023.Avian influenza can jump from birds to mammals, including humans. The virus has been reported in close to 50 mammal species — including foxes, seals and polar bears — and has recently been detected in cattle for the first time. There are no known cases of bird flu being passed on from a mammal to a human or between humans, and the risk of infection is limited to people who are in direct contact with infected animals.

The USDA said the strain of virus in Michigan, Texas and Kansas appears to have been introduced by wild birds, but transmission of the virus between cattle "cannot be ruled out."The affected Montcalm County farm voluntarily stopped movement of livestock from the farm to limit spread of the disease, the agriculture department said.In a press release, the department urged farmers to be vigilant about biosecurity amid "this national situation.""This case does reflect a lot of what is already known about this virus — namely, that it is highly contagious, it continues to be primarily spread by wild birds and contact with infected animals, and mammals can contract the virus," State Veterinarian Nora Wineland said. "As more is learned, it is vitally important for producers to work with their veterinarian and isolate sick animals from others, minimize the number of visitors to their farms, prevent contact between their animals and wildlife, and continue to vigilantly monitor the health of their animals."Avian influenza can be transmitted from sick birds and animals or through items that were exposed to the virus, such as feed, equipment or farmers' shoes.It's unclear how the sick cows contracted disease, agriculture department spokesperson Chelsea Lewis-Parisio said.The infected cows are recovering, Lewis-Parisio said. Avian influenza is often fatal to chickens and other birds.The agriculture department said human health risk remains low because the virus from the sick cows has not shown significant changes that would make the virus more transmissible between mammals. No infected milk or meat is entering the food supply, Lewis-Parisio said.The ongoing avian influenza outbreak hit Michigan farms in 2022. The state has issued roughly two dozen alerts about infected flocks and pets since February 2022.ckthompson@detroitnews.com Facebook Twitter EmailHelpTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicySite MapResponsible DisclosureYour Privacy Choices © 2024 The Detroit News, a Digital First Media NewspaperTexas Dairy Cattle Test Positive for Avian Influenza | Dairy News | lancasterfarming.com Skip to main content You are the owner of this article.

The current highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza, circulating in the United States since 2022, has been detected in an unusual number of mammals, including seals, skunks and mountain lions.Initial testing has not found changes to the virus that would increase its transmissibility to humans, so USDA said the risk to the public remains low.The illnesses raise no concerns about the safety of the milk supply because only milk from healthy cows is sent to processing. Milk from the sick animals is being diverted or destroyed, according to USDA.In any case, pasteurization inactivates influenza and other microbes in milk, the agency said.USDA, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and state agencies are investigating the illness and conducting additional testing on the influenza strains.The illness has affected mainly older dairy cows in Texas, Kansas and New Mexico. The cows had decreased milk production, thick and discolored milk, and low appetite. Affected farms may lose up to 40% of their production for seven to 10 days until symptoms subside.About 10% of the cattle in affected herds have shown symptoms, with few to no deaths reported.While poultry flocks are depopulated when they test positive for avian influenza, Texas Ag Commissioner Sid Miller said he did not expect that would happen in dairy herds.USDA is urging farms to practice good biosecurity to protect against disease.

Wild geese are believed to be the main carriers of avian influenza.CHICAGO ― Samples of milk collected from sick cattle in Kansas and Texas tested positive for avian flu, but the nation's milk supply is safe, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Monday.The detections in milk and a dairy cow show the wide reach of the virus, known as bird flu, which has been found in poultry flocks and mammals around the world.The USDA, the U.S Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are investigating dairy cows in Kansas, Texas and New Mexico with symptoms including decreased milk production and low appetite, the USDA said.So far, "unpasteurized, clinical samples of milk" collected from two dairy farms in Kansas and one in Texas tested positive for highly pathogenic avian flu, the government said. A cattle swab test from another dairy in Texas also was positive.Based on findings from Texas, wild birds, which spread the virus globally, appear to have introduced the virus to cattle, the USDA said. Testing indicates the risk of human infection is low, according to the agency.Government says no concern about contamination of milk supplyThe government said milk from sick cows is being diverted or destroyed so it does not enter the food supply. Pasteurization is required for milk entering interstate commerce, a process that kills bacteria and other pathogens such as flu viruses, the USDA said."At this stage, there is no concern about the safety of the commercial milk supply or that this circumstance poses a risk to consumer health," the agency said. It added there should be no impact on prices for milk or other dairy products.Iowa agriculture secretary urges reporting of cattle illnessesIn Iowa, the nation's top egg producer, avian influenza spread primarily by wild geese has prompted the destruction of millions of domesticated birds to prevent its spread, and there have been no reports of it infecting other livestock. State Secretary of Agriculture urged "industry partners, farmers and veterinarians to report cattle illnesses quickly to the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship at 515-281-5305."“We are communicating with USDA, other states and industry stakeholders while we learn more and as there are new developments. Protecting Iowa's livestock farmers from foreign animal disease has been and will continue to be one of my top priorities as Secretary.”U.S. dairy industry groups urged importers not to ban or restrict shipments of U.S. dairy products because of the detections.Importers have limited purchases of U.S. poultry since the nation's worst-ever outbreak of the disease began in chicken and turkey flocks in 2022.Des Moines Register staff writer Donnelle Eller contributed to this article.

Wild waterfowl are the natural carriers of avian influenza and are attracted to water.Arid Texas offers birds fewer water sources than Pennsylvania does, so birds may be more likely to frequent livestock watering troughs in Texas than in the Northeast.Even so, farmers might want to keep cattle separated from wild birds that visit a farm pond, Hamberg said.Farmers should also clean up spilled feed and consult USDA Wildlife Services if they need help keeping wild birds out of animal housing, Hamberg said.Concern for dairy biosecurity has ratcheted up since a mystery illness hit some farms in Texas, Kansas and New Mexico starting last month.The cows exhibited a sudden drop in milk production, thick and discolored milk, stools that were either tacky or loose, low appetite, and sometimes a low-grade fever.Affected farms lost up to 40% of their production for seven to 10 days until symptoms subsided.About 10% of the cattle in affected herds showed symptoms, with few to no deaths reported.Symptoms were reported in older cows in mid-lactation, not dry cows or calves, Hamberg said.USDA announced Monday that the avian influenza virus was detected in unpasteurized milk from sick cows in Kansas and Texas, and in a swab from another Texas dairy.Affected farms had reported dead wild birds on their properties, and the findings in Texas suggest the illness was introduced by wild birds, according to USDA.The influenza strain found on the dairies is circulating in North America’s western bird flyways but has not been found on the Eastern Flyway, Hamberg said.While the avian influenza testing has demystified the situation in Texas, the American Veterinary Medical Association said Monday that it’s too early to say whether avian influenza caused the illness in all of the affected cattle.Hamberg said additional contributing factors may be found as the investigation continues.Though no cattle are known to have been infected on the East Coast, dairy farmers who have concerns about their herd should contact their veterinarian.Pennsylvania’s three animal diagnostic labs can test nasal swabs for avian influenza and, in coordination with the national veterinary lab network, are working on protocols to test milk, Hamberg said.Farmers are encouraged to isolate sick cattle, reduce sources of stress, and monitor feed and water intake until the animals recover.Supportive care seems to be have been sufficient for the Texas cattle that had avian influenza. A farm’s vet is best positioned to recommend care tailored to that operation, Hamberg said.Different From PoultryAvian influenza infections in dairy cattle are rare and differ in important ways from outbreaks in poultry.The disease is generally fatal to domestic bird species, so flocks are depopulated to prevent spread.But cattle appear to recover relatively quickly, and Texas Ag Commissioner Sid Miller said he did not expect dairy herds would need to be killed.Avian influenza is adapted to live in wild waterfowl, not mammals, which are generally dead-end hosts.No evidence points to cow-to-cow transmission in Texas, Hamberg said.As a result, no restrictions have been placed on shipping cattle in that region.If Pennsylvania cattle got avian influenza, Hamberg said he likely wouldn’t implement the control areas, with testing and movement restrictions, that are used for infected poultry farms.Avian influenza also does not threaten the milk supply.Only milk from healthy cows is sent to processing. Sick cows produce abnormal milk in markedly decreased quantities, so farmers would likely notice a problem before milk even got into the bulk tank, Hamberg said.In any case, pasteurization inactivates the influenza virus in milk, he said.Biosecurity on cattle farms is generally looser than on poultry and swine farms, where diseases adapted to those species can quickly kill many animals.But biosecurity has gained attention in the dairy industry since the nationwide avian influenza outbreak among poultry farms began two years ago, costing Pennsylvania 4 million birds.The Pennsylvania Dairy Summit has made biosecurity planning a focus the past two years.The dairy infections in the Southwest follow Minnesota’s March 20 report that a kid goat tested positive for avian influenza on a farm where poultry also had the virus.The owner notified the state of unusual deaths in newly kidded goats. The goats and poultry had access to the same space and a shared water source. The adult goats tested negative for avian influenza.The Minnesota Board of Animal Health said this was the first known instance of highly pathogenic avian influenza infecting a domestic ruminant in the U.S.The current highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza, circulating in the United States since 2022, has been detected in an unusual number of wild mammals, more than 200.Many of these have been predators or scavengers, including seals, mountain lions and skunks.The risk of avian influenza infection in humans remains low, according to USDA.

Here’s how it works. In a first, bird flu was recently detected in cows on U.S. farms. (The pictured cows are not among those infected.) (Image credit: Bloomberg / Contributor via Getty Images) Dairy cows on farms in Texas and Kansas have tested positive for bird flu in the first known cases in cows in the U.S., and likely the world. Cows in New Mexico are also thought to have been infected, but they have not yet been tested.Three weeks ago, the cows became sick with a cold-like illness, The Associated Press reported. The animals were producing less milk than usual, their appetites decreased and they appeared lethargic. Unpasteurized milk samples and throat and nose swabs showed that the cows were infected with the H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza, the Texas Animal Health Commission announced Tuesday (March 26). This strain is known to cause outbreaks in wild and domesticated birds and to occasionally infect people. The announcement comes a week after the first U.S. cases of bird flu in goats (Capra hircus) were reported. The goats were sharing a pasture and water source with ducks and chickens that were infected with bird flu on a backyard farm in Stevens County, Minnesota, according to a report by the World Organisation for Animal Health.The spread of bird flu to goats "highlights the possibility of the virus infecting other animals on farms with multiple species," Brian Hoefs, the Minnesota state veterinarian and executive director of the Minnesota Board of Animal Health, said in a statement released March 20.Related: Bird flu wipes out over 95% of southern elephant seal pups in 'catastrophic' mass deathBased on the new results from Texas, officials think the dairy cows were likely infected by wild birds. The tests did not detect any changes to the bird flu virus that would make it more transmissible to humans, the AP reported.Sign up for the Live Science daily newsletter nowGet the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.In outbreaks of bird flu in poultry, officials have had to cull entire flocks to control the spread of the virus. By contrast, the cows that tested positive for bird flu appeared to recover without treatment within seven to 10 days, experts told the AP. The virus infected about 10% of lactating dairy cows in the affected herds. As such, the situation "doesn't look anything like the high-path influenza in bird flocks," Michael Payne, a food animal veterinarian and biosecurity expert at the University of California, Davis, told the news agency. RELATED STORIES—1st known 'highly pathogenic' bird flu cases in Antarctic could threaten penguins—'Parrot fever' outbreak in 5 European countries kills 5 people—Highly pathogenic bird flu behind 'unusual deaths in cats' in Poland, WHO says Only milk from healthy animals on the affected dairy farms will enter the food supply. The U.S. Department of Agriculture considers the risk to people low and noted in a statement that pasteurization, which is required for milk sold through interstate commerce, kills viruses and bacteria. So far, H5N1 bird flu has been reported in 48 mammal species, including foxes, skunks, raccoons, seals and polar bears. "It was probably only a matter of time before avian influenza made its way to ruminants," which include hooved, cud-chewing mammals like cattle, goats and sheep, Payne said.There are no reported cases of bird flu being transmitted from nonhuman mammals to humans in the U.S. to date, according to the Minnesota Board of Animal Health. There have been rare cases of the infection spreading from birds to people. Any risk of infection is limited to people who have direct contact with infected animals, experts told the AP.Ever wonder why some people build muscle more easily than others or why freckles come out in the sun?

(Getty Images:: Justin Paget)abc.net.auews/protecting-yourself-against-flu-rsv-and-covid/103588894Link copiedShareShare articleCooler weather is on our doorstep and it's bringing some very unwanted house guests — their names are COVID, influenza and RSV.Some experts are predicting a particularly bad flu season and there's concern vaccine uptake will remain low and, in turn, hospitalisations will increase.There's also talk of the dreaded "flu-rona".Past experience shows RSV infections will ramp up soon too, usually around April. Some vaccine guidelines have also recently changed.Let's unpack the latest advice.InfluenzaThe 2023 flu season was particularly long, but the 2024 season could be even worse, says Michael Clements, vice president and rural chair of the Royal Australian College of GPs."We've been isolated in the past [during the pandemic] so there isn't a lot of herd immunity."International travel is full steam ahead and we typically import our influenza from the northern hemisphere."However, he says a higher rate of infections can also reflect the fact people can now buy at-home testing kits and find out if they have influenza or RSV."So in the past we may never have even known they had influenza."Children aged between six months to five years old are at high risk of developing severe influenza symptoms. (Getty Images: MoMo Productions)Christopher Blyth, a paediatric infectious diseases professor with the University of Western Australia, says every influenza season is different so it's hard to make many predictions."But what I will say is a significant number of children will be hospitalised with influenza this year, like every year."Last year, children between the ages of five and nine had the highest influenza notification rates, and the number of deaths in children under 16 was higher than in many pre-COVID pandemic years. "The bulk of children hospitalised are in good health, they just aren't vaccinated," says Professor Blyth, who's the director of the Wesfarmers Centre of Vaccines and Infectious Diseases at the Telethon Kids Institute.According to the latest government data, influenza cases are higher than expected for this time of year (around 1.7 times greater than the same time last year).Your immunisation guide:Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for everyone over six months of age.The following groups can receive their vaccine for free under the National Immunisation Program (NIP):children aged between six months and five yearsthose over 65Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peopleanyone pregnantthose with medical conditions that increase their risk of severe influenzaThe Queensland government also recently announced it would pay the cost of the flu vaccine for all residents not covered by the NIP. Dr Clements says pharmacies are starting to see vaccines trickle in, but the government stock is not due until around early April."I know some people are really keen but we actually want to tell them it's OK to wait, as it takes a month or so to get peak effect from the vaccine and it does taper off at between four to six months."Professor Blyth says getting a vaccine in April will mean you're protected when infections start ramping up in May and still be covered for the peak, which is typically in August.A flu vaccine is needed every year as influenza virus strains mutate. (ABC News: Herlyn Kaur)Vaccination coverage last year was low, with around 32 per cent of the population vaccinated.Dr Clements says it's "heartbreaking" to see people suffer from something preventable and he particularly wants to see more pregnant women and young children vaccinated this year.He says the higher the vaccine uptake, the lower the peak of infections. This will make the entire community safer, including those who aren't vaccinated."Because there's always people who can't get the vaccine or have it but it doesn't work."The vaccine's effectiveness rate is between 40 to 60 per cent.RSVRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections are common and can be very disruptive."Most parents can give a really good history of being awake at night worried about the wet cough their child has," Dr Clements says."For the elderly, it's often RSV that triggers the pneumonia that kills them."Chronic cough should be investigated, say doctorsPhoto shows A serious young girl with large eyes, large glasses, dark blonde hair, bangs leans into a serious older women wearing glasses.A cough is necessary to keep the airways clear and to remove foreign particles such as dust. But respiratory experts say coughs that linger need to be investigated.The virus can infect the lungs and breathing passages and is the leading cause of hospitalisations in infants nationwide.RSV is so common partly because individuals lose their immunity to it relatively quickly. Reinfection can occur just two months after the last infection."In the next couple of weeks to months we will have plenty of RSV. It's one of the major causes of bed block in paediatric hospitals," Professor Blyth says.RSV normally surges around April to July in the southern states, while case numbers in the tropics can be more consistent throughout the year.Your immunisation guide:For years, Australians have suffered through RSV without the option of immunisation.But this autumn, for the first time, that's no longer the case for some people.The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) last year approved a drug called Nirsevimab, which is a long-acting antibody that's been shown to reduce infections by about 75 per cent for up to five months.While Nirsevimab is not currently part of the National Immunisation Program (NIP), some states have free immunisation programs for infants and children.Earlier this month, the Western Australian government announced it will provide free access to Nirsevimab from April for all babies under eight months (or up to 19 months for those at increased risk of severe RSV).This week, the Queensland and New South Wales governments followed suit and announced their own free RSV immunisation programs.In Queensland, newborn infants, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander infants less than eight months of age and certain infants with complex medical conditions are eligible.In New South Wales, premature babies born after October 31, 2023, all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander babies born after October 31, 2023 and certain vulnerable infants are covered.Loading...In a separate development, Australians over the age of 60 may have access to a free RSV vaccine in the future.The TGA recently approved AREXVY which is a protein-based vaccine for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV.It is currently only available on private prescription (which means the consumer pays the full cost) as it's not funded through the NIP.However the manufacturer of AREXVY has applied for the vaccine to be made available for free through the NIP, and Dr Clements believes this could happen next year.COVID-19COVID-19 transmission is low at the moment, Professor Blyth says, but cases are expected to rise around the same time as the influenza and RSV peaks."We're concerned COVID will just piggyback onto another cough or cold so if someone has RSV they might then happen to get COVID and have dual infections and be even sicker," Dr Clements says."It's known as flu-rona".Professor Blyth says those who will be most at risk will be older Australians and those who are immunocompromised.ABC Health in your Instagram feedFollow @abchealth on Instagram, where we're busting myths and sharing practical, smart health advice.Your immunisation guide:Last month the government updated its COVID-19 vaccination guidelines.Six-monthly boosters are now only recommended for those over the age of 75.Anyone over 18 can have an annual booster.But if you're 65 to 74 or severely immunocompromised you can have a six-monthly booster. Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits.A booster is not currently recommended for those between the ages of five and 17 who are not immunocompromised. Individuals in this age group who are severely immunocompromised can get a booster every 12 months.Children under five are not currently recommended to have a booster.Anything else?Both Dr Clements and Professor Blyth urge all Australians to check with their GP about whether they're up to date with routine vaccinations.This includes the shingles vaccination, which is free under the National Immunisation Program (NIP) for those most at risk, including anyone over the age of 65 and select groups under 18 who are immunocompromised.New shingles jab free for older AustraliansPhoto shows A person with an outbreak of shinglesThe risk of developing shingles increases with age. But a new vaccine, tipped to be 90 per cent effective, is now available through the National Immunisation Program for older and immunocompromised Australians. The pneumococcal vaccine is another important one.Pneumococcal disease can cause a variety of diseases, like pneumonia and meningitis, and young children and the elderly are most at risk.It is free under the NIP for certain groups including children, adults aged 70 and over and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders aged 50 and over."It's not just about protecting yourself against the seasonal viruses but it's about keeping up to date with the routine stuff too," Professor Blyth says.Editor's note: An earlier version of this story said anyone over the age of 18 was advised to have an annual COVID-19 vaccine booster. This has been amended to better reflect the health advice which says those over 18 (as well as severely immunocompromised individuals aged between 5 –17 years) can receive an annual booster.Health in your inboxGet the latest health news and information from across the ABC.Your information is being handled in accordance with the ABC Privacy Collection Statement.Email addressSubscribePosted Tue 26 Mar 2024 at 6:30pmTuesday 26 Mar 2024 at 6:30pmTue 26 Mar 2024 at 6:30pm, updated Thu 28 Mar 2024 at 3:26amThursday 28 Mar 2024 at 3:26amThu 28 Mar 2024 at 3:26amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesFamily shares tribute for Eleanor Bryant, teacher's aide killed when truck crashed into preschoolTopic:Road Accidents and IncidentsPhoto shows Eleanor Bryant, who was killed when a truck crashed into a Victorian preschool, pictured smiling at the races.Early election speculation reaches a fever pitch as Albanese announces two candidates in two hoursTopic:ElectionsPhoto shows A man in a black suit and a yellow tie stands at a podium, addressing the press and gesturing to the crowd.Donald Trump and the one big threat to Australia's almost $4 trillion superannuation systemDAnalysis by David TaylorPhoto shows SuperannuationUnder proposed laws the truth about COVID-19 could have been struck from the internetTopic:Social MediaPhoto shows A row of people looking at their phones with one set of hands and phone in focus.

Here's the current conservation status of the marine mammal.Farms in Texas, Kansas report finding dead birds on propertiesAdditional testing took place Friday and over the weekend, the USDA reported, because farms have also reported finding dead wild birds on their properties.Based on findings from Texas, the agency wrote in the release, the detections appear to have been introduced by wild birds, and the commercial milk supply "remains safe due to both federal animal health requirements and pasteurization."Bird flu spread to humans is low risk, USDA saysInitial testing by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories has not found changes to the virus that would make it more transmissible to humans, the USDA said, which means the risk to the public contracting the virus remains low for now.Federal and state agencies said they "are moving quickly" to conduct additional bird flu testing."The first detection of HPAI in dairy cattle in Texas and Kansas underscores the importance of adherence to biosecurity measures, vigilance in monitoring for disease, and immediately involving your veterinarian when something seems ‘off,’" American Veterinary Medical Association president Dr. Rena Carlson said. "A complete evaluation, including the collection and submission of laboratory samples and reporting to state animal health officials when appropriate, and in a timely fashion, are incredibly important."Bird flu in Texas, Kansas affecting older dairy cowsThe Texas Animal Health Commission confirmed the flu virus is the Type A H5N1 strain, known for decades to cause outbreaks in birds and to occasionally infect people.The virus, the state agency said, is affecting older dairy cows in Texas and Kansas, as well as cattle in in New Mexico, causing symptoms including decreased lactation and low appetite.Breaking: Baltimore's Key Bridge collapses after ship collision; 2 rescued, search continues: Live updatesWhat is bird flu? Bird flu is a disease caused by a family of flu viruses primarily transmitted among birds.Avian influenza viruses, according to the CDC and USDA, are classified into two groups: low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) (often seen in wild birds) and HPAI, found mostly in domestic poultry. According to the Centers for Disease Control, LPAI viruses cause mild or no disease, and HPAI cause severe disease and high mortality rates in infected birds.Bird flu has cost the government roughly $660 million and in recent times raised the price of eggs and poultry. At least 58 million birds were slaughtered last year to limit the spread of the virus.What are signs of bird flu?Symptoms of bird flu include:Loss of appetite, lethargy.Death without prior symptoms.Eyelid swelling.Twisting of the head and neck.Purple discoloration to body parts, including legs.'No concern' about commercial milk supply safety"At this stage," the USDA wrote, there is "no concern about the safety of the commercial milk supply or that this circumstance poses a risk to consumer health."Dairies are required to send milk from healthy animals into processing before it can be put on grocery shelves, the agency said, and the milk from the sick animals was being destroyed.In addition, USDA officials said, pasteurization "has continually proven to inactivate bacteria and viruses," including influenza, in milk.It's also required for milk entering interstate commerce."For the dairies whose herds are exhibiting symptoms, on average about ten percent of each affected herd appears to be impacted, with little to no associated mortality reported among the animals," the USDA wrote in its release. "Milk loss resulting from symptomatic cattle to date is too limited to have a major impact on supply and there should be no impact on the price of milk or other dairy products."Natalie Neysa Alund is a senior reporter for USA TODAY.

The virus has killed millions of birds worldwide, but this is the first time it has been detected in cattle. Read moreMass death of seal pups raises fears of bird flu spreading in mammals How many cows are affected by bird flu? As of 25 March, milk samples collected from two dairy farms in Kansas and one in Texas have tested positive for a subtype of avian influenza called H5N1, according to The New York Times. This strain is highly lethal in birds. A cattle throat swab taken from a dairy farm in Texas also tested positive. No cows have died from the virus so far.Advertisement US agencies began testing cattle for bird flu on 22 March after farms in Texas, Kansas and New Mexico reported some dairy cows had fallen ill, and that dead wild birds were on their properties. On the affected farms, about 10 per cent of milking cows appear to be sick, most of whom are older. It is unclear if bird flu is responsible for all of the animals’ illnesses. US agencies are moving quickly to conduct additional testing. How did the cows catch the virus? The USDA says it appears the cattle caught the virus from infected wild birds. However, it is unclear exactly how the virus transmitted between the species. Most mammals who fall ill with bird flu are carnivores, such as foxes or seals, meaning they most likely contracted the virus from eating dead and infected birds. As cows don’t eat birds, it is harder to explain the source of transmission, says Richard Webby at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Tennessee. It could be that faeces or saliva from wild birds contaminated the cattle’s water or food. “The biggest question I can’t quite get my head around is how to explain infections across such a geographic spread of states,” says Webby. The worst-case scenario is the virus spread among the cows, but this is perhaps unlikely, he says. That is because we haven’t found evidence that bird flu can transmit between mammals. Do the sick cows increase the risk of bird flu spreading to people? The risk of contracting bird flu remains low for most people. Initial testing of samples from infected cattle haven’t found genetic changes that would suggest the virus has become more transmissible to humans. Yet any time a mammal becomes ill with bird flu, it provides the virus an opportunity to gain the necessary mutations to transmit between mammals, says Webby. “But we still need some answers to put this into perspective: most of all, how many cows show evidence of being infected with the virus?” If few cows are ill, this will most likely be another dead end for the virus, much like foxes, bears and other previously infected animals were. Is milk safe to drink? Yes, milk is still safe to drink. The USDA already requires that dairy farms only send milk from healthy cattle in for processing. Milk from infected cows has also been destroyed so it won’t enter the food supply. Even if some contaminated milk entered the supply chain, pasteurisation kills bacteria and viruses, including influenza. Read moreHow prepared is the world for a pandemic of bird flu in people?

In November last year, researchers warned in a pre-print research paper that if the virus caused mass mortality in these colonies, “it could signal one of the largest ecological disasters of modern times”.In December 2023 and January 2024, scientists tested 16 Adélie penguins on Beagle island in the Antarctic peninsula for H5N1, and seven (43%) tested positive. Satellite trackers on the penguins showed they were alive and foraging as normal two months later in early March 2024. At another site on Red Rock Ridge, nine Adélie penguins were tested and one tested positive.None showed any sign of disease, which is good news for the penguins – but researchers warn they could act as “Trojan horses” facilitating the spread of the virus to vulnerable species.“These asymptomatic cases may seem reassuring for the species in question, but they have strong implications for Antarctic wildlife in general, potentially leading to unnoticed and widespread virus transmission,” wrote researchers, led by Fabiola León from UC Chile, in the bioRxiv paper, which has yet to be peer reviewed.Their findings are cause for “some cautious optimism for penguin populations”, says Colin Butter, an associate professor of bioveterinary sciences at the University of Lincoln, who was not involved in the research.Bird flu: access to Ernest Shackleton’s grave ‘blocked by dead seals’Read moreWhile it is possible some penguin populations could be resistant, this cannot be known for certain, as many other penguin species have died in South America. Bird flu’s widespread distribution across Antarctica would also threaten other populations, including seals and whales. “The Antarctic ecosystem is precious and fragile. Influenza virus could cause devastating disruption from which it will not recover,” Butter said.Ed Hutchinson, a molecular biologist from the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, who was also not involved in the paper, said the limited sampling meant this survey only provided a snapshot of what was happening.“The fact that apparently healthy birds were found to be infected with influenza viruses is really important, but it is not surprising,” he said. “We know from elsewhere in the world that some types of bird are more likely to become severely ill with this virus than others.“As the spread of coronavirus in humans reminded us, the presence of healthy but infectious individuals can be a real problem in controlling the spread of an outbreak … this study highlights the importance of continued monitoring of this.”Dr Connor Bamford, a virologist from Queen’s University Belfast said he was cautious about the findings. “More work is needed to study these animals with regard to avian influenza in sickness and in health. High mortalities associated with highly pathogenic H5 have been documented in penguins in the past … However, the reasons why these penguins appear to be protected, and its implications, are hard to say.”The testing between December 2023 and January 2024 was conducted along the east and west coasts of the Antarctic peninsula and Antarctic western coast. It provides a snapshot of how the virus is spreading in the continent.In total, 115 seemingly healthy birds were sampled, and nine tested positive, including eight Adélie penguins and one Antarctic shag. Researchers tested 31 emperor penguins and none tested positive. It is not possible to say if the virus had reached these colonies and was no longer present, or if these birds had not been exposed to it at all.Bird flu was first confirmed on Antarctica’s mainland in February, after a number of cases in the sub-Antarctic islands. The paper’s researchers said: “The first-time detection of suspected cases of H5N1 influenza in penguins and cormorants in the Antarctic continent marks a significant expansion … into this isolated continent and puts highly vulnerable bird populations at risk.”The spread of H5N1 has caused millions of wild birds to die globally, with thousands of sea lions and seals also dying from “spillover” events into wild mammals. After its arrival in the sub-Antarctic in October, there have been mortalities in about 10 species of Antarctic seabirds and seals.Explore more on these topicsBird fluThe age of extinctionAntarcticaBirdsWildlifeAnimalsHealthnewsShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedEnvironmentClimate crisisWildlifeEnergyPollutionNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

(dcr)Experts Confirm First Bird Flu Outbreak in Cows: Is It Safe to Drink Milk? : ScienceAlert Space Health Environment Humans Tech Nature Physics Society Opinion Explainer About Us Our Team Follow Us Daily Newsletter Contact Privacy Privacy Manager Accessibility Terms © 2024 ScienceAlert Pty Ltd Experts Confirm First Bird Flu Outbreak in Cows: Is It Safe to Drink Milk? Health28 March 2024By Carly Cassella (SimonSkafar/Getty Images) A "mysterious" cow disease in the United States that causes thick and discolored dairy milk has turned out to be the first confirmed outbreak of bird flu among cattle.According to an official statement from the US Department of Agriculture, cows at four dairy farms in Texas and Kansas have tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Cases have also been confirmed in the state of New Mexico, though officials have not shared the number of dairy farms or cows impacted. Apparently, scientists working to investigate the outbreak found traces of the influenza virus in several samples of cow milk before it was pasteurized. But officials say this milk is clearly abnormal and would never make it to market. Jim Lowe, a veterinarian and influenza researcher at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, told Emily Anthes of The New York Times that the contaminated milk looks syrupy and thick. Even if this product somehow ended up on shelves, experts say pasteurization would protect consumers from the virus. The rare outbreak comes more than fifteen years after a lab experiment showed that cattle really are susceptible to bird flu, as some experts had hypothesized. The study was prompted by the 1997 outbreak of H5N1 in Asia that caused fatal infections in wild birds, poultry, and even humans. Pigs were infected in a 2005 outbreak, but for years, it wasn't clear if ruminant farm animals, like cows, could be infected, too. Since the late 1990s, scientists have hypothesized that the bird flu can jump over to cattle from humans or other animals, but clear evidence has been lacking. Sick cows in the United Kingdom were found with rising antibody levels to human strains of H1N1. And in 1999, a study found evidence that cows with reduced milk production showed signs of an influenza infection. The recent contagion spreading among dairy farms in the US, however, is historically unique. So far, it has impacted roughly four dairy farms, and only about 10 percent of each affected herd. Some farmers have noticed deceased wild birds on their property, too, which suggests the source came from migrating avians. Luckily, few to no cows have died from the virus so far, but the infection drives a sharp drop in milk production, sometimes up to 40 percent, that usually lasts for a week to 10 days. The Texas Department of Agriculture (TDA) says it is "vigilantly monitoring" the virus' spread. "There is no threat to the public and there will be no supply shortages," says Commissioner Sid Miller. "No contaminated milk is known to have entered the food chain; it has all been dumped. In the rare event that some affected milk enters the food chain, the pasteurization process will kill the virus." The USDA press release also assures the public that pasteurization has "continually proven to inactivate bacteria and viruses, like influenza, in milk". Scientists are now sequencing the genome of the virus to figure out where it came from and how it jumped to cows. This very same month, a handful of goats in the state of Minnesota also tested positive for H5N1, becoming the first domestic ruminant in the US to fall ill with bird flu. "This finding is significant because, while the spring migration is definitely a higher risk transmission period for poultry, it highlights the possibility of the virus infecting other animals on farms with multiple species," said state veterinarian Brian Hoefs in a statement for the American Veterinary Medical Association earlier this month. "Thankfully, research to date has shown mammals appear to be dead-end hosts, which means they're unlikely to spread HPAI further." Since late 2021 – which marks the start of an ongoing bird flu outbreak among US poultry – officials have recorded more than 200 cases of HPAI in mammals, such as foxes, racoons, possums, skunks, seals, leopards, bears, mountain lions, and bobcats. Cows and goats can now be added to that list. "Unlike affected poultry, I foresee there will be no need to depopulate dairy herds," says Miller."Cattle are expected to fully recover. The Texas Department of Agriculture is committed to providing unwavering support to our dairy industry."

Back to Healio Key takeaways: The new vaccine outperformed Moderna’s bivalent vaccine from 2022 in a phase 3 trial. The findings pave the way for development of the company’s combination vaccine against COVID-19 and influenza. Perspective from Amesh A. Adalja, MD; Walter A. Orenstein, MD Moderna announced positive interim results from a phase 3 trial of its next-generation COVID-19 vaccine, which the company said will help pave the way for its combination shot against COVID-19 and influenza. The investigational COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA-1283, induced a more robust immune response compared with the company’s bivalent vaccine, mRNA-1273.222, according to a press release. Moderna announced positive results from a phase 3 trial of its next-generation COVID-19 vaccine. Image: Adobe Stock The updated vaccine design offers a longer shelf life and can be distributed in prefilled syringes, replacing the multidose bottles that have been used for previous COVID-19 vaccines. Moderna said the success “paves the way” for its combination COVID-19 and influenza vaccine — one of several vaccine candidates the company is developing. The investigational COVID-19 vaccine “is a critical component of our combination vaccine against flu and COVID-19, mRNA-1083, and this milestone gives us confidence in our ability to bring this much-needed vaccine to market,” Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel, MSc, MBA, said in the release. Moderna enrolled 11,400 people aged 12 years or older in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada in the ongoing randomized, observer-blind, active-controlled phase 3 NextCOVE trial to compare mRNA-1283 with the older bivalent mRNA-1273.222 vaccine. The new mRNA-1283 vaccine elicited a higher immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 omicron BA.4 and BA.5 variants and subvariants, as well as the original wild virus, than the previous vaccine, according to the company. Moderna said the benefit was “most acutely seen” in study participants aged older than age 65. Moderna also announced positive clinical data for three other vaccines against Epstein-Barr virus, varicella-zoster virus and norovirus and said it expects data from phase 3 trials on its combination COVID-19/influenza vaccine and its cytomegalovirus vaccine later this year. Additionally, it is seeking FDA approval and CDC support of its mRNA-based RSV vaccine this year. “Our mRNA platform continues to have a remarkable track record across our broad vaccine portfolio,” Bancel said. “With five vaccines in phase 3, and three more moving toward phase 3, we have built a very large and diverse portfolio addressing significant unmet needs.” References: Moderna achieves positive interim results from phase 3 trial of next-generation COVID-19 vaccine. https://investors.modernatx.comewsews-details/2024/Moderna-Achieves-Positive-Interim-Results-from-Phase-3-Trial-of-Next-Generation-COVID-19-Vaccine/default.aspx.

Adalja, MD As COVID-19 transitions to endemicity, there will always be need for innovation in the countermeasures used to combat it. In the current era, developing vaccines that have enhanced immunogenicity and provide more protect against infection — protection against mostly severe disease — will be valued. Also, vaccines that are easier to give in terms of enhanced shelf life and less owner storage requirements will make vaccination programs easier to implement. Lastly, combination vaccines may make vaccination more convenient for those in certain risk groups that require more frequent vaccination, although not all will merit that frequent dosing. Amesh A. Adalja, MD Senior scholar Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security Disclosures: Adalja reports no relevant financial disclosures. Perspective Back to Top Walter A. Orenstein, MD Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 are two viruses that evolve to overcome pre-existing immunity. Because the body’s immune response is made against parts of the viruses that can change, vaccines must be periodically updated to take account of the actual viruses that will circulate in the forthcoming season. Because it is likely that both vaccines will be recommended at the same time each year, progress in developing a combination COVID-19/influenza vaccine should help in implementation and, hence, enhancing uptake. Moderna’s announcement of progress in developing a combination vaccine is promising. Results of a phase 3 trial are expected this year. Walter A.

Students can schedule an appointment via myUHS or call 814-865-4UHS (4847). Credit: Penn State. Creative CommonsExpandMarch 25, 2024UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — On March 1, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated its longstanding, non-health-care-setting guidelines for people who have recently tested positive for COVID-19. The guidelines now align with recommendations for common respiratory illnesses, including influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, known as RSV. The CDC’s guidance for COVID-19 is a symptom-based strategy that eliminates the need for people with COVID-19 to isolate for at least five days. Some respiratory illness symptoms can include chest discomfort, shortness of breath, fever, fatigue, vomiting and more. Symptomatic people can return to normal activities if, for 24 hours, they have been fever-free without using fever-reducing medication and if symptoms have been improving overall. The CDC encourages people recovering from respiratory illnesses and returning to normal activities to take additional preventive steps for the next five days to curb disease spread, including: Wearing a well-fitting mask. Keeping a distance from others. Getting tested to inform your actions to prevent spread to others. The CDC’s guidance also acknowledges that people recovering from respiratory illness and people who test positive for a virus but have no symptoms are typically less contagious but can still transmit the disease to others. Those who test positive for a virus but do not have symptoms can curb asymptomatic spread by wearing a well-fitting mask and keeping a distance from others for five days following the positive test. While all respiratory viruses may not act similarly, according to the CDC, adopting a unified approach makes recommendations easier to understand and, thus, more likely to be followed. The CDC recommends staying up to date with immunizations, practicing good hygiene, and taking steps for cleaner air. Penn State and University Health Services have and will continue to follow CDC guidance for COVID-19 and respiratory illnesses. “The preventive, common-sense infection control strategies outlined in the guidance are part of the same education and public health messaging we have always disseminated to keep our students and staff healthy,” said Cecilia Devonshire, UHS infection control nurse manager. “If you feel sick, stay home — do not go to class, do not attend indoor or crowded events, skip the Saturday night dinner or party, and take care of yourself. You are taking care of the community when you choose to take care of yourself.” Visit the CDC’s respiratory illnesses website and FAQ page for more information on the latest CDC guidelines. Continued viral activity The CDC updates come at a time when respiratory viruses like influenza, common colds and stomach viruses are still circulating widely. “Before everyone left for spring break, we continued to see strong flu numbers at UHS and in the wastewater surveillance. This is higher than we have seen in the past two flu seasons but consistent with pre-pandemic activity, which shows flu can last into April and May,” said Dr. Rebecca Simcik, UHS medical director. “We also had students who were quite ill, with non-flu and non-COVID viruses, and we expect continued presentation as everyone gathers back to campus and the classrooms. We might all be sick of winter and all the illnesses it brings, but we need to continue to mind the preventive measures that reduce the chance of getting sick.” With warmer weather approaching, it is important to practice the following preventive measures to reduce the chances of getting sick: Hand-wash with either soap and warm water or hand sanitizer frequently and before eating. Avoid touching your face with unwashed hands. Wear a high-quality mask when traveling through crowded or poorly ventilated spaces like buses or highly populated buildings or if you are already experiencing respiratory symptoms. Avoid sharing food and drinks. Clean frequently touched surfaces such as doorknobs and mobile devices. Rest and re-charge, as adequate sleep is imperative in keeping your immune system running at full capacity. Stay up to date with vaccines. UHS offers the flu vaccine and the Moderna (Spikevax) COVID-19 vaccine. Both vaccines are usually free with most insurance. Students who are sick and unsure if they should see a clinician can call University Health Services’ 24/7 Advice Nurse line at 814-865-4847 and press option 3. Students can schedule an appointment via myUHS or call 814-865-4UHS (4847). Students with respiratory symptoms who also have risk factors for severe illness should seek health care right away for testing or treatment. Treatment for flu and COVID-19 may be an option and needs to be started within a few days of when symptoms begin. Students who are sick and need to stay home are responsible for communicating directly with instructors if they must miss a class, lab, work or assignments. Verification of illness forms will not be provided for routine illnesses or injuries, per University Health Services policy. Faculty are encouraged to continue to be sensitive to students’ well-being and work with them individually to meet academic requirements as they recover from illness.

Back to Healio Key takeaways: Among those who were part of a messaging intervention in the ED, 30-day influenza vaccine uptake was 41%. The findings have significant implications for populations without access to primary care. Use of an influenza vaccine messaging platform in EDs increased vaccine uptake among unvaccinated patients, a study in NEJM Evidence showed. “We fully expected the interventions to improve vaccination rates... but we were a bit surprised at how large a difference there was,” Robert M. Rodriguez, MD, a professor of emergency medicine at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, told Healio. Data derived from: Rodriguez R, et al. NEJM Evid. 2024;doi:10.1056/EVIDoa2300197. According to Rodriguez, one of the driving factors of the study was that the patient populations that the researchers serve — such as homeless and historically underrepresented populations — “really don’t get opportunities to get vaccinated for various diseases that other people who have insurance and other access to health care do.” In the randomized controlled trial, Rodriguez and colleagues created an influenza vaccine messaging platform that consisted of a 3-minute video, one-page flier and a verbal scripted health care provider message. Participants were then asked, “would you accept the influenza vaccine in the ED today if your doctor asked you to get it?” If participants answered “yes” and gave permission, their health care providers were notified. The video and flier also featured physicians and personnel who matched the racial and ethnic characteristics of the participant. Participants (n = 767) were assigned to either: intervention M, which included the video, flier and scripted message, followed by the vaccine acceptance question and provider notification; intervention Q, which included no messaging but the vaccine acceptance question and provider notification; or a control group, which included usual care and no interventions. The trial was conducted across six ED departments in five U.S. cities from October 2022 through February 2023. Among those in the cohort, 32% lacked primary care, 9% were homeless or marginally housed, 16% lacked health insurance and 36% were Black. The researchers found that the intervention M, intervention Q and control groups had 30-day vaccine uptakes of 41%, 32% and 15%, respectively. When intervention M was compared with intervention Q, the adjusted difference in 30-day vaccine uptake was 8.7% (95% CI, –0.1% to 17.6%). Intervention M (49%) and intervention Q (45%) both had similar percentages of those who said they would accept the influenza vaccine in the ED (adjusted difference = 3.1%; 95% CI, –5.9% to 12.1%). “There’s always going to be a population that does not have access to primary care, that has no other place to go and does not have access to or receive messaging about vaccines,” Rodriguez explained. “The practical implications of this are that we should engage these populations in the ED, provide messaging for flu vaccines and offer them in the ED.” He added that the next steps for future research could include “expanding on the programs like we enacted, and implementation-type science — in other words, making it easier to do in a variety of ED settings.” “We had specific staff and personnel in our EDs that allowed us to provide messaging and so forth. Other EDs ... they’re not going to have that dedicated staff,” Rodriguez noted. “The next step is making it widely available through a number of ways.” References: Just ask: patients in the ER are willing to get a flu shot. https://www.eurekalert.orgews-releases/1038816.

Updated March 26, 2024 The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has identified Influenza A as the wild waterfowl-borne disease creating milk production problems in Texas, Kansas and New Mexico dairy herds. The disease was previously identified as Texas Agalactiae Syndrome. However, genetic sequencing revealed the “mystery illness” as a strain of Highly Pathonogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) virus that’s existed in the U.S. for two years. According to AgWeb.com, the USDA says affected dairy cows do not appear to be transmitting the virus to other cattle within the same herd. ADVERTISEMENT Read Also USDA lowers U.S. soybean/corn yield estimates There were a few tweaks to the latest monthly report from the United States Department of Agriculture released on Nov. 8. The World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates not only lowered yields for U.S. corn and soybeans, the department reduced the ending stocks for both. HPAI has been known to transmit to humans, but those cases are rare. The U.S. National Veterinary Services Laboratories says it has not found changes to the virus that would make it more transmissible to humans, adding “The current risk to the public remains low.” Before avian influenza was identified, Canadian dairy organizations had urged producers to limit animal movement. Clinical signs of infection include: Decreased herd level milk production Acute sudden drop in production with some severely impacted cows experiencing thicker, concentrated, colostrum-like milk Decreased feed consumption with a simultaneous drop in rumen motility Abnormal tacky or loose feces and some fever ADVERTISEMENT The Texas Animal Health Commission says symptoms of the disease last between 10 and 14 days. The exact cause of the illness is undiagnosed and still unknown. Affected producers have reported older cows in mid-lactation may be more likely to be severely impacted than younger cows and fresh cows or heifers. The United States Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) says there is no indication this is a foreign animal disease. Producers are being asked to be diligent in their farm level biosecurity, especially with individuals that have recently been in the U.S. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has also asked for heightened border controls around people who have been on farms in the U.S. If animals are brought from the U.S., they should be quarantined on-farm and monitored very carefully for any illness symptoms, especially those listed above. ADVERTISEMENT Producers are also asked to report any potential symptoms to their local veterinarians. Dairy Farmers of Canada says it is working with CFIA to monitor the situation and will continue to update should there be further developments. Highly pathogenic avian influenza is not a human health risk in properly cooked meat and pasteurized milk. The HPAI virus has hit Canadian poultry operations in recent years. Millions of birds have been culled across the country. Updated to include the new information about Avian Influenza causing this animal health concern.

The virus was also found among cows at two dairy farms in Kansas.What is 'mystery dairy cow disease'?Texas Department of Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller told AP News that concerns arose three weeks ago when cattle started exhibiting symptoms of what officials described as a "mystery dairy cow disease."The illness is primarily among older dairy cows, according to a release from the USDA. Miller said the initial symptoms included a significant drop in milk production, lethargy and reduced appetites, according to AP.“We hadn’t seen anything like it before,” he said. “It was kind of like they had a cold.”Wild birds may have infected Texas cowsOfficials from the U.S. Department of Agriculture suspect that wild birds infected the cows, as farms have reported finding dead wild birds on their properties. For example, earlier this month, the Texas Animal Health Commission declared an outbreak in two backyard, non-commercial flocks in Moore and Deaf Smith counties, both situated in the Panhandle, totaling over 260 birds.It's believed to be the first instance of bird flu in U.S. livestock, although the virus has been detected in other mammals previously. For example, a skunk tested positive in Carson County just over a year ago, marking the first mammal in the state to test positive.Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced earlier this month the virus in juvenile goats on a farm in Minnesota, where a flock of poultry also tested positive.More: At least 7,000 cows have died in historic Texas wildfires, official saysHow many animals have died of bird flu?The most recent outbreak of avian flu, caused by the H5N1 strain, was first identified in Europe in late 2020. Although the strain has existed for several decades — first identified in waterfowl in Southern China in 1996, according to the CDC — it has escalated in recent years.The virus has led to the deaths of approximately 57 million animals, marking the poultry industry's largest hit since another major outbreak claimed the lives of more than 50 million birds in 2014-2015.What are signs of bird flu?Symptoms of bird flu include:Loss of appetite, lethargy.Death without prior symptoms.Eyelid swelling.Twisting of the head and neck.Purple discoloration to body parts, including legs.More: 1.3 million chickens to be culled after bird flu detected at Ohio farmCan bird flu spread to humans?According to the USDA, initial testing by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories has not identified any changes to the virus that would increase its transmissibility to humans, and it is not currently a risk to humans.Will the bird flu outbreak impact milk supply?Currently, there is no concern regarding the safety of the commercial milk supply or the potential risk the outbreak might pose to consumer health. The USDA mandates that dairies must send only milk from healthy animals for human consumption processing. Milk from affected animals is being diverted or destroyed and does not enter the supply for human consumption.Furthermore, pasteurization, which is a requirement for commercial milk, has a historical track record of effectively deactivating bacteria and viruses, such as Influenza.

(KELO) — More than 6,000 cases of the flu have been recorded in South Dakota, according to data kept by the Department of Health (DOH), with 39 cases being reported as lethal. According to further DOH data, there have been a total of 16,275 cases of the flu recorded this season, as of March 20, 2024. Close Thanks for signing up! Watch for us in your inbox.

Sorting data by percentage of positive tests, the counties most impacted are Harding and Lincoln, each at 50% positivity, with 16 and 1,032 cases respectively. Minnehaha’s rate is 30.28%. Great Plains Zoo unveils plan for new aquarium KELOLAND News spoke with Avera’s Dr. Chad Thury on Tuesday, who told us that 39 deaths at this point in the year is not necessarily uncommon and is in fact more of a return to the mean of recent years. A review of DOH data from previous seasons shows this. For the 2022-23 season, for instance, a total of 38 deaths were tallied. In 2019-20, the number was 35 deaths. What makes the deaths this year stand out are the seasons of 2020-22, where we saw a total of 24 deaths over two seasons; two in 2020-21 and 22 in 2021-22. “Outside of 2020-2021, when COVID hit — we kind of had that down year with influenza — we generally are in the 30s for influenza deaths,” said Thury. “I would say this flu season has probably been the most typical one we’ve probably had in the last three years.” Thury also says that cases at this point appear to be slowing down a bit. “Regionally, influenza numbers look like they’re coming down,” Thury said. “We had a pretty good peak there through February and early March.” Defibs for W.H. Lyon Fairgrounds One change from recent years Thury says is the vaccination rate is slightly down. “If you look at our vaccination rates regionally — we’re probably down about 4-5% (compared to the past two seasons),” he said. Thury noted that the percentage of people 65-years-old and up has stayed more or less stable, meaning it is people younger than 65 who are declining in vaccination rate. In terms of medicating for a flu, Thury says the big thing to account for is fever, advocating the use of Tylenol and ibuprofen to keep temperatures down. As for when you should seek outside medical treatment for flu symptoms, Thury said those who experience high fevers, feel lethargic, have trouble breathing and are unable to keep fluids down should seek help, as should those with pre-existing conditions that put them at risk of complications from influenza, such as those who are older or immunocompromised.

PDF FILE In recent years, the emergence of Avian Influenza H5N1 has raised concerns among poultry farmers and health authorities worldwide. While this highly pathogenic avian influenza primarily affects birds, there have been instances of cross-species transmission, including cases involving goats in the United States. Detection and Impact Since January 2022, the United States has reported cases of Avian Influenza H5N1 in both wild waterfowl and commercial poultry. The virus has been detected in 14 states among wild birds and in 13 states among domestic and commercial poultry. While the risk to human health remains low, monitoring and containment efforts are crucial to prevent further spread. Goats and Cross-Species Transmission Goats, typically not associated with avian diseases, have surprisingly tested positive for H5N1. These cases highlight the potential for cross-species transmission and the need for vigilance in monitoring livestock health. Although goats are not considered a primary reservoir for the virus, their susceptibility underscores the importance of surveillance and biosecurity measures on farms and in backyard settings. Biosecurity Measures Farmers and animal caretakers should adhere to strict biosecurity protocols to minimize the risk of infection. These measures include:Continue after advertising. Isolation: Isolate sick animals promptly to prevent disease spread within the herd. Sanitation: Regularly disinfect equipment, feeders, and water sources. Restricted Access: Limit access to the farm to essential personnel only. Monitoring: Monitor animal health closely and report any unusual symptoms promptly. Vaccination: Consult with veterinarians about vaccination options. Public Health Implications While the risk of human infection from goats is low, individuals with direct exposure to infected animals should take precautions. People working with goats or handling their products (such as milk or meat) should: Practice Hygiene: Wash hands thoroughly after handling goats or their products. Avoid Contact with Sick Animals: If goats exhibit symptoms, avoid close contact. Seek Medical Attention: If flu-like symptoms develop after exposure, seek medical evaluation. Ongoing Surveillance The United States continues to monitor Avian Influenza H5N1 outbreaks closely. The data collected by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) are regularly updated and provide critical information for disease control efforts. These data include outbreak details by state, county, flock type, and flock size. In conclusion, while goats testing positive for H5N1 is a rare occurrence, it underscores the need for vigilance in monitoring and biosecurity practices. By staying informed and implementing preventive measures, we can mitigate the impact of avian influenza on both animal and human health.

Agencia de Marketing GanaderoBird Flu Found in Cow Milk in Texas and Kansas Skip to content Search Home Latest Tech Reviews Science io9 AI Video Deals Best of 2024 Health Bird Flu Found in Cow Milk in Texas and Kansas Avian influenza was found among sick cattle in two states, as well as in unpasteurized milk, but officials said there is no threat to the public. By Ed Cara Published March 26, 2024 | Comments (5) | ð Copied! An adult black and white cow. Image: Clara Bastian (Shutterstock) Bird flu has reached the cows. Health and agriculture officials announced this week that cattle in two states have tested positive for a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), likely caught from wild birds. Though the virus seems to have sickened the cattle, it is not thought to pose a high risk to humans at this time. The discovery happened during an investigation into outbreaks of a mysterious illness affecting cattle in Texas, Kansas, and New Mexico, which involved the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and local agencies. Officials reported Monday that samples of unpasteurized milk collected from dairy cows on several farms in Kansas and Texas have tested positive for bird flu, specifically a strain of Type A H5N1 influenza. The outbreaks largely affected older cattle, which have commonly experienced symptoms such as decreased milk production and low appetite. The investigation also found dead birds in the vicinity of these outbreaks, indicating their likely role as the origin. But initial testing of the flu strains found in these cattle has not found any major changes that would make them more able to spread or cause disease in humans, and there are currently no concerns about the virus reaching the public through contaminated milk, officials said. âThere is no threat to the public and there will be no supply shortages,â said commissioner Sid Miller in a statement from the Texas Department of Agriculture. âNo contaminated milk is known to have entered the food chain; it has all been dumped. In the rare event that some affected milk enters the food chain, the pasteurization process will kill the virus.â Bird flu is considered one of the most likely germs to become a pandemic threat. The generally high mutation rate of influenza and the novelty of a strain that successfully jumps from other animals to humans could potentially create a virus that not only spreads rapidly but is much deadlier than the typical seasonal flu. Strains of H5N1 bird flu have been circulating for at least 25 years, sparking large and deadly outbreaks among wild birds and sometimes domestic poultry populations. But in recent years, weâve started to detect more cases of bird flu in mammals, including minks, sea lions, and dolphins. Just last week, Minnesota officials reported finding H5N1 flu among baby goats living on a farm where an outbreak had recently infected poultry, the first such incident discovered in U.S. livestock. Cases of H5N1 and other highly pathogenic avian influenza strains in humans have remained rare (if deadly) and difficult to transmit between people so far. But the more spillover between birds and mammals that occurs, the more likely that picture could change. Last year, the World Health Organization warned that while the risk of H5N1 spreading to people is low for now, âwe must prepare for any change in the status quo.â InfluenzaMilk Daily Newsletter Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

How Bird Flu in Dairy Cows Affects MilkMenuHealthIs Milk Safe to Drink Right Now? How Bird Flu in Dairy Cows Affects MilkDon’t fret and pour yourself a tall glass of milk. by Miriam FauziaMarch 26, 2024JENS SCHLUETER/AFP/Getty ImagesOn Monday, state and federal officials announced that what was previously deemed a “mystery cow disease” is actually a highly pathogenic avian influenza (or HPAI), also known as bird flu. Milk and nasal swabs from infected cattle from at least two dairy farms in Kansas and two in Texas tested positive for the H5N1 strain of the influenza virus, a deadly and aggressive form that’s been infecting and killing multiple species in recent years, including humans in very rare cases.The report follows the first-ever case of bird flu reported in a young goat in western Minnesota and the pernicious outbreak of the virus among poultry. While birds can easily contract the virus, mammals aren’t known to, although it’s happening more often in recent years. This is the first-ever case of bird flu among cows and it’s believed the animals contracted it from infected birds making their migratory pass, as sightings of dead wild birds have been found near farm properties, the Department of Agriculture said.Does this mean it isn’t safe to drink milk right now? If you’re worried about how this outbreak of bird flu will affect your dairy consumption, rest assured you can pour yourself a cold glass of milk without any worry.Is it safe to drink dairy milk?The short answer is yes, as long as it's pasteurized.“There is no threat to the public and there will be no supply shortages,” Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said in a press release. “No contaminated milk is known to have entered the food chain; it has all been dumped. In the rare event that some affected milk enters the food chain, the pasteurization process will kill the virus.”The U.S. Department of Agriculture also emphasized that there is no current concern or risk to public health.“Dairies are required to send only milk from healthy animals into processing for human consumption; milk from impacted animals is being diverted or destroyed so that it does not enter the food supply. In addition, pasteurization has continually proven to inactivate bacteria and viruses, like influenza, in milk. Pasteurization is required for any milk entering interstate commerce,” the agency said in its Monday statement.Drinking unpasteurized (or raw) milk carries many significant dangers, mostly commonly associated with harmful bacteria such as Salmonella, Escherichia coli, and many others that cause foodborne illnesses.The legal sale of raw milk is still permitted in some states, including Texas and Kansas, but there are stipulations on how the milk is sold. For instance, in Texas, dairy farms selling raw milk have to have it tested every three months; in Kansas, the sale has to take place at the farm and the product has to be explicitly labeled or advertised as raw milk.The bright side is that unlike poultry, which are culled if they’re infected, cows, for the most part, are recovering just fine (it takes the animals about a week to 10 days). State and federal officials are continuing to monitor the situation among dairy farms nationwide for “additional cases and minimize the impact to farmers, consumers, and other animals,” said the Department of Agriculture.What is bird flu?Avian influenza is part of a family of influenza viruses, which come in four types (A, B, C, and D), causing respiratory infections in both animals and humans. Types A (to which avian influenza belongs) and B viruses are responsible for seasonal flu epidemics we commonly associate with the flu season. These two viral types have surface proteins — hemagglutinin and neuraminidase — that constantly switch up, resulting in new strains emerging and causing periodic epidemics (and the reason why we reformulate our flu vaccines every year).The low pathogenic form of avian influenza (or LPAI) causes either mild or no disease. The highly pathogenic form, as the name suggests, is more concerning since it carries a high mortality rate for infected birds — HPAI causes death in 90 to 100 percent of chickens within 48 hours — and the ability to spread far and outside its usual species target, meaning it could become an emerging threat including to humans who don’t normally get infected.Bird flu has historically affected poultry but not livestock; cows aren’t considered susceptible to the virus. However, it’s unclear whether the sick cattle in Kansas and Texas each contracted the virus directly from an infected bird or if one sick animal passed it around to the others. Right now, at least, cows and other livestock like goats aren’t considered a host for the virus.“This finding [of an infected goat] is significant because, while the spring migration is definitely a higher risk transmission period for poultry, it highlights the possibility of the virus infecting other animals on farms with multiple species,” Minnesota State Veterinarian Brian Hoefs said in a press release regarding the case involving the infected goat. “Thankfully, research to date has shown mammals appear to be dead-end hosts, which means they’re unlikely to spread HPAI further.”Learn Something New Every DaySubscribe for free to Inverse’s award-winning daily newsletter!SubmitBy subscribing to this BDG newsletter, you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy PolicySubscribe to our newsletter >More Like ThisHealthBritish Wartime Rationing Reveals a Shocking Truth About SugarHealthThe Real Reason America Is Obsessed With Beef Is Not What You Think HealthCommon Pharmaceutical Drugs Don’t Work For Many People — Here’s What Researchers Think Is Happening Related TagsHealthMedicineFoodsearchEntertainmentTVMoviesReviewsStreaming RecsMarvelStar WarsSee AllGamingNewsReviewsGuidesZeldaFinal FantasySee AllGearNewsReviewsGuidesSee AllInnovationTechnologyScienceSustainabilitySpaceTransportation + EVsSee AllMind + BodyFitnessNutritionLongevityMental HealthSee AllLatestNewsletterAbout UsMastheadAdvertiseTermsPrivacyDMCAYour Privacy Options© 2024 BDG Media, Inc.

The Ministry of Health and Prevention (MoHAP) confirmed that travellers to Saudi Arabia must present influenza vaccination cards, effective March 26.

"As of Tuesday afternoon, none of our passengers were asked for the vaccination cards or any such documentation." Stay up to date with the latest news. Follow KT on WhatsApp Channels. According to MoHAP, preventive measures are taken as part of its commitment to protecting the health and safety of pilgrims, Haj performers, their families, and all segments of society from infectious diseases. Not taking chances Naveeda Jukaku is scheduled to travel to Saudi Arabia for Umrah on March 31 and is still trying to figure out what to do. "The new rules specify that the vaccination should be taken ten days prior to travel which means I am already late for it," she said. "Neither my travel agent nor the airlines have been able to give me any clarification." Naveeda, who will travel with her extended family, has decided not to take any chances. "I have just booked an appointment to get influenza vaccination at a local clinic," she said. "Even though we are still seeking clarity, I want to be on the safe side." The Ministry also clarified that individuals who have previously received the influenza vaccine within the past year are exempt from obtaining a new vaccination. Approved vaccination cards can be obtained through the Al Hosn application and presented at travel checkpoints. Seeking clarity A spokesperson for the Sharjah Airport Travel Agency said many issues were pending clarity. "Several visitors to Saudi Arabia now opt for the multiple entry tourist visa," he said. "Many of them perform their Umrah on this visa. It is unclear how the mandatory vaccine will be enforced on such people." The spokesperson further said that none of their travellers had been asked for their vaccination records. "We have had people travelling to Saudi for Umrah on both the Umrah visa as well as multiple entry visa today," he said. "However, none of them were asked for their vaccination record. We are expecting more clarity on the rules and how it will be enforced." A call centre agent at Saudia airlines said that they had not received any circulars from UAE immigration so far. "We have not received any intimation on what is required and how the rules will be enforced," she said. "So far, it is business as usual from our side."

Published Monday, March 25, 2024 By E247 Necessary vaccinations must be taken before traveling, especially for the elderly, to ensure the effectiveness of the vaccine and provide sufficient immunity for prevention. Those who have received the influenza vaccination within less than a year are not required to obtain a new vaccination. The approved vaccination card can be obtained through health centers and is also available on the Al Hosn application. Vaccinations are available at all government and private health centers. The list of required vaccinations and requirements for performing Hajj are available through the General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments website. The Ministry of Health and Community Protection affirmed the mandatory nature of taking all required basic doses of vaccinations, especially the influenza vaccine, and following all guidelines and precautions before traveling to perform Umrah and Hajj, as part of its commitment to preserving the health and safety of pilgrims, Hajj performers, their families, and all segments of society, from infectious diseases. The ministry indicated that travelers to Umrah will be required to present their influenza vaccination cards starting from March 26, 2024. It recommended the importance of visiting a health center before leaving the country with sufficient time, especially in the case of chronic diseases, noting the availability of vaccinations at all government and private health centers. This is within the framework of the ministry's strategy aiming to protect the community from all risks, infectious and prevalent diseases, and controlling them. The guidelines include taking vaccinations before traveling with a sufficient period of not less than ten days before the travel date to ensure the effectiveness of the vaccine and provide sufficient immunity for prevention. For those suffering from chronic diseases, consulting a doctor to ensure the stability of their health condition and their ability to perform Hajj and Umrah is necessary, in addition to taking an adequate amount of medication, ensuring to take all necessary and recommended immunizations, and engaging in regular physical exercises. The ministry also pointed out that those who have previously received the influenza vaccination and completed less than a year from the dose do not need to obtain a new vaccination. The approved vaccination card can be obtained through the Al Hosn application before traveling and presented at the country's ports upon departure. The health and safety of pilgrims are a priority. Dr. Hussein Abdul Rahman Al Rend, Assistant Undersecretary for Public Health Sector, emphasized that including the influenza vaccination along with other vaccinations for Hajj and Umrah travelers comes within the Ministry's special attention to ensure their health and safety, especially for those with chronic diseases, the elderly, pregnant women, and lactating mothers. He affirmed the high-level coordination between the efforts of state institutions concerned with organizing and caring for the affairs of pilgrims' convoys, ensuring their health and safety during performing Hajj and Umrah without exposing them to any health problems, aiming to protect them and society from all potential health risks, especially infectious and chronic diseases. Al Rend mentioned that launching a campaign to vaccinate pilgrims against influenza is in line with the national policy of vaccinations, which represents a national framework for combating infectious diseases, including seasonal influenza, to reduce its complications on individuals and society. This contributes to developing the healthcare system's response to respiratory diseases and enhancing surveillance mechanisms, thereby improving the results of the strategic indicator for vaccination coverage according to international standards, by providing them in the healthcare facilities network, realizing the ministry's understanding of the importance of health security and preventing and containing risks as a national health priority in the UAE. The list of vaccinations, vaccines, and general requirements for performing Hajj for this year can also be referred to through the General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowments website. Vaccinations are the most successful preventive measures. Dr. Nada Al Marzouqi, Director of the Public Health and Prevention Department, explained that vaccinations are considered one of the most successful and effective preventive measures. Therefore, the ministry urges all travelers and pilgrims to take the necessary basic and optional vaccinations before traveling for Hajj and Umrah, emphasizing that the ministry provides vaccines in health centers extensively. Dr. Al Marzouqi also urged pilgrims to follow preventive measures to avoid health problems during performing Hajj and Umrah, such as avoiding heat exhaustion and physical stress during movement, which increases the chances of contracting some diseases and health problems, and ensuring a healthy nutrition system.

The UAE's Ministry of Health and Prevention (Mohap) recently confirmed that travellers going to Saudi Arabia for Umrah or Haj would have to present influenza vaccination cards. Etihad Airways said the certificate would be mandatory for all their passengers who are flying to Jeddah. Other airlines are yet to issue guidelines. Stay up to date with the latest news. Follow KT on WhatsApp Channels. At Thumbay University Hospital, the travellers' clinic is busier than usual, said Dr Fiaz Ahamed, infection control physician. "(The clinic is packed with) Umrah pilgrims who are getting immunisations in accordance with Mohap's directive. More than 50 people are visiting us every day for the flu vaccine," said Dr Ahamed. The jab, he said, would effectively lower travellers' risk of contracting flu upon their return. Aster Hospital in Dubai's Mankhool area is seeing a similar trend. “Our facility and clinics have seen a surge of patients coming in to get the flu shot. As many as 50 flu vaccines were administered in the month of March at our hospital,” said Dr Jyoti Upadhyay, an internal medicine specialist at Aster. Umrah is known as a minor pilgrimage to the holy city of Makkah that can be performed at any time of the year. With the Umrah season coinciding with the influenza season, health authorities have underscored the importance of vaccination to prevent the spread of flu. Easy process In response to the increased demand, UAE hospitals have ramped up its vaccination efforts, ensuring adequate supply and streamlining the process to accommodate the surge in patients. “We have implemented special arrangements to accommodate the anticipated surge in demand over the next few days. This includes prioritising bookings for appointments and establishing a fast-track route for fasting pilgrims,” said Dr Ahamed. “Additionally, the hospital promptly issues vaccination certificates for documentation, ensuring a seamless and efficient experience for all individuals seeking influenza vaccination before undertaking Umrah," he added. When should you take the vaccine? Dubai doctors recommend that the pilgrims take either the Influvac or Influenza Tetra vaccine at least 10 days before their travel date. The 10-day time frame allows for the development of optimal immunity, Dr Ahamed said. “Given the proximity and crowded conditions encountered during Umrah, the risk of acquiring influenza is heightened, posing threat to vulnerable populations such as the elderly and those with underlying conditions like diabetes and asthma,” he added. How much does it cost? At Aster Hospital, the Influvac vaccine is being offered at Dh99. "Our pharmacy is gearing up to stock more doses of the Influvac vaccine, to make sure everyone can get it easily," Dr Upadhyay said. Mohap's decision to make influenza vaccination mandatory for Umrah pilgrims comes as part of ongoing efforts to enhance public health measures and mitigate the spread of infectious diseases.

All culled chickens were buried properly, and the farm is undergoing disinfection,” Orais told reporters after a meeting of the Regional Avian Influenza Task Force here.On March 12, the local government of Kananga, Leyte, reported to the DA about the “abnormal daily mortality” of chickens inside the Leyte Poultry Development Corp., owned by Benjamin Pongos, Jr.A month earlier, farm workers observed nasal discharge in some chickens.The onset and the exponential mortalities were noted in the first week of March.Gasping, nasal discharge, and a swollen head were the common signs exhibited by the birds.“Migratory birds could be the source of infection, and we are also looking at the possibility of the illegal movement of infected birds from infected areas,” Orais added.The DA urged poultry raisers in Leyte and the region to protect and shield their farms from the entry of migratory birds and, more importantly, to immediately report any unusual poultry mortalities.The National Meat Inspection Service regularly monitors the movement of chicken meat in the market.The police and the military were also urged to keep vigilance in the transport of poultry products.Avian influenza or bird flu is a disease caused by infection with avian (bird) influenza (flu) Type A viruses.These viruses naturally spread among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species. Bird flu viruses do not normally infect humans. However, sporadic human infections with bird flu viruses have occurred.

Earlier this week, the UAE Ministry of Health and Prevention (MoHAP) declared the influenza vaccination mandatory for all travellers heading to perform Umrah and Hajj, emphasising the importance of adhering to all vaccination protocols and health precautions. The ministry’s announcement stated that Umrah travellers would be required to show proof of their influenza vaccination starting March 26, 2024. The ministry also recommended vaccinations to be administered at least 10 days before departure to guarantee vaccine efficacy and immunity. Following the announcement, Etihad Airways on Thursday said all passengers, except certain categories, travelling from Abu Dhabi to Jeddah will need to have an influenza vaccination certificate. “In line with regulations applied by the health authorities in the United Arab Emirates, from Tuesday 26 March until further notice, all Etihad Airways guests travelling from Abu Dhabi to Jeddah will need to have an influenza vaccination certificate,” the Abu Dhabi airline said in a statement to Gulf News.

Explaining the categories of passengers who are not required to provide the vaccination certificate, the airline said: “The regulation does not apply to guests in transit whose journey does not originate in the UAE, to residents of the KSA who hold proof of residency, or to those arriving into the UAE from Jeddah.” “The safety and security of our passengers and crew remains our number one priority,” it added. Rush at hospitals Meanwhile, multiple private healthcare groups told Gulf News that their facilities have observed an increase in demand for influenza vaccinations over the past few days, particularly from individuals preparing for Umrah. Dr Lulu Azeez A “The announcement has prompted many individuals, especially those planning to undertake Umrah this Ramadan, to prioritise getting vaccinated to ensure compliance with the requirements set by the authorities,” said Dr Lulu Azeez A, specialist, Internal Medicine, Aster Hospital Al Qusais Dr Saira Haider, general practitioner, Family Medicine, Burjeel Day Surgery Centre, Al Reem, said: “As vaccination is now mandatory for travel, some patients are seeking vaccination services on short notice, as they must update their vaccination status on the Al Hosn app prior to departure.” Dr Saira Haider Dr Saira Haider, general practitioner, Family Medicine, Burjeel Day Surgery Centre, Al Reem, said: “As vaccination is now mandatory for travel, some patients are seeking vaccination services on short notice, as they must update their vaccination status on the Al Hosn app prior to departure.” Dr Jyothish George Dr Jyothish George, specialist dermatologist and director of Homecare services and Vaccination with Prime Hospital, said: “Though many people have taken the flu vaccine before, our facilities are seeing an increase in flu vaccine related enquiries.” Doctors pointed out the need for those wishing to perform Umrah during Ramadan to get vaccinated immediately to meet the 10-day validity requirement for the vaccine certificate which is to ensure that the passengers have gained immunity against the flu viruses. “It is important to note that optimal immunity development typically requires at least 10 days after vaccination. Therefore, individuals planning to travel within the next two weeks are strongly advised to receive their vaccinations promptly,” said Dr Haider. Echoing the same, Dr Azeez, said: “It is advisable for pilgrims intending to perform Umrah during Ramadan to promptly get vaccinated to meet the 10-day validity period for the vaccine certificate. Given the rush and the necessity to ensure adequate protection against influenza, pilgrims should not delay in receiving the vaccine. Early vaccination ensures sufficient time for the body to develop immunity against the flu virus and for the vaccine certificate to remain valid throughout the pilgrimage period.” Special arrangements Healthcare groups said they are fully equipped to handle the increased demand and have ample stocks of vaccines. They said they are also making special arrangements to meet the sudden rush. These include walk-in vaccinations, homecare services, increased staffing, extended hours, and streamlined scheduling to support efficient vaccine administration. Varying cost The cost of the flu vaccine at private healthcare facilities varies depending on the specific vaccine formulation and any promotional offers or discounts available at the time of vaccination. While Emiratis get it for free and expat residents can receive the flu vaccine for Dh50 at 12 ambulatory health centres at Dubai Health, generally, the cost ranges from Dh75 to Dh120 at private healthcare facilities.

2HealthGS Paper - 3Economics of Animal-Rearing Source: IE Why in News? H5N1 bird flu, a highly pathogenic virus, has been spreading globally, posing a significant threat to birds and wildlife. What is H5B1 Bird Flu? Background: Avian influenza A(H5N1) or H5B1 Bird Flu is a highly pathogenic virus that primarily circulates among birds but can infect mammals. H5N1 originated from a virus outbreak in China in 1996 and rapidly evolved into a highly pathogenic strain. Since 2020, it has spread across Europe, Africa, Asia, North America, South America, and even mainland Antarctica. India experienced the first H5N1 outbreak in the State of Maharashtra and Gujarat in 2015. Impact on Animals: Wild birds, including endangered species like California condors, have been severely affected by H5N1. The main species affected used to be chicken. Marine mammals, such as sea lions and dolphins, have suffered mass deaths in regions like Chile and Peru. Mammals like foxes, pumas, bears in North America, and farmed minks in Spain and Finland, have also been infected. Human Risk and Spread Factors: While rare, humans can contract bird flu, primarily through contact with infected birds. Climate change may exacerbate the spread of the virus, altering bird behaviour and increasing interactions between bird species. World Health Organization (WHO) Risk Assessment: While the virus does not easily infect humans, sporadic cases continue to occur, mainly linked to poultry exposure. Human-to-human transmission remains rare, but the potential for further cases exists, particularly in regions where the virus is endemic in poultry. WHO assesses the overall risk to the general population as low but emphasises the importance of surveillance and risk management. Preventive Measures and Recommendations: WHO advises the public to avoid high-risk environments like live animal markets and practise good hand hygiene. Prompt reporting of sick animals and avoiding consumption of sick poultry are recommended. Individuals exposed to infected birds or environments should seek medical care promptly.

Credit: Supplied“This year, based on the current level of medicine sales that we’re seeing, we’re expecting to see a year that is at least as potent as 2023, if not more,” Dr Anantham said.In WA, Hillarys in Perth’s north, Fremantle in the south and Mirrabooka in the north-east are expected to be the hardest hit with cold flu in 2024.In fact, Hillarys is expected to be WA’s cold and flu capital and 7th worst place in Australia overall.Fremantle comes in second for WA and 10th in Australia overall.👀👀👀COPYCAT: Is Kim K taking style inspiration from Censori?Newcastle and Liverpool in NSW and Southport in Queensland are expected to be hardest hit, the modelling finds.“It shouldn’t be a major concern, it is largely just an inconvenience. Time off work, kids at home from daycare and so on. It’s really about just being prepared to deal with all of that inconvenience,” Dr Anantham said.University of South Australia professor of biostatistics Adrian Esterman said colds were difficult to track and predict because most people did not go to the doctor for a common cold, so comprehensive data was not available.Camera IconEpidemiologists advise young, elderly, and pregnant people to get vaccinated against influenza this season. Credit: News Corp AustraliaInfluenza cases were “very high at the moment” and double the weekly number for this time last year, the epidemiologist said, though the number through the flu season would be tough to predict.“A doubling of last year (flu cases) doesn’t suggest that it will double (overall), it could be peaking early,” he said.Retail data, such as in the modelling, was a “reasonable” marker for the cold and flu season’s severity “but that does not tell you who has influenza, a cold or RSV (respiratory syncytial virus”, the professor said.Jackpot prizeInstant millionaire in Perth’s north after big Lotto winYoung children, the elderly and people who were pregnant needed to be vaccinated against the flu, he said.A good source of data for influenza-like-illnesses was the Australian Sentinel Practices Research Network, Mr Esterman said. The network of GPs and registered nurses reports influenza-like-illnesses and publishes fortnightly reports.However, the latest data is only up until February 1. An ASPREN spokeswoman said March data should have been publicly available, but then did not respond to a request for the latest report.Worst cold and flu areas by StateWA: Hillarys, Fremantle, MirrabookaNSW: Newcastle, Liverpool, BlacktownQueensland: Southport, Cairns, Hervey BaySouth Australia: Clovelly Park, Torrensville, SeafordTasmania: Launceston, Lindisfarne, Sandy BayVictoria: Warrnambool, Baxter, PrahranNation’s cold & flu capitals1.

This has been confirmed by the airline in a statement to Khaleej Times. This comes after UAE's Ministry of Health and Prevention (MoHAP) announced mandatory influenza vaccine for pilgrims travelling to Saudi Arabia for Hajj and Umrah starting on March 26. “In line with regulations applied by the health authorities in the United Arab Emirates, from Tuesday 26 March until further notice, all Etihad Airways guests travelling from Abu Dhabi to Jeddah will need to have an influenza vaccination certificate,” read the statement. Stay up to date with the latest news. Follow KT on WhatsApp Channels. “This certificate needs to be presented at check-in for inspection prior to flying in either paper hard copy or on an approved UAE digital health application.” However, the statement specified that the ruling is not applicable on some people. “The regulation does not apply to guests in transit whose journey does not originate in the UAE, to residents of the KSA who hold proof of residency, or to those arriving into the UAE from Jeddah.” Etihad Airways further stated that the safety and security of its passengers and crew remains their number one priority. MoHAP clarified that individuals who have previously received the influenza vaccine within the past year are exempt from obtaining a new vaccination. Approved vaccination cards can be obtained through the Al Hosn application and presented at travel checkpoints. Other airlines In a document issued to travel agents, Air Arabia has stated that passengers traveling from the UAE to Saudi Arabia for Umrah are “recommended” to take their flu vaccination before embarking on their journey. According to some travel agents, they have also received similar circulars from other airlines like Saudia. A comment from Emirates Airlines is awaited. Several passengers have been in a state of limbo since the news was announced on Tuesday. Dubai resident Shaziya is planning to travel to Saudi Arabia for Umrah next week via road. “I am not sure if this rule will affect us,” she said. “The rule specifies that the pilgrim should be vaccinated 10 days in advance. We don’t have ten days for our travel now. I am really confused what to do.” Travel agents had also expressed their concern as to how the rules would be applied to those entering Saudi Arabia on multiple entry visa. “Several visitors to Saudi Arabia now opt for the multiple entry tourist visa," said an agent. "Many of them perform their Umrah on this visa. It is unclear how the mandatory vaccine will be enforced on such people."
