Influenza hospitalizations and vaccination coverage have shown disparities among different racial and ethnic groups since the 2009-10 influenza season. Non-Hispanic Black, American Indian or Alaska Native, and Hispanic adults have higher rates of influenza hospitalization compared to non-Hispanic White adults. In the 2021-22 season, influenza vaccination coverage was lower among Hispanic, American Indian or Alaska Native, Black, and other/multiple race adults compared to White and non-Hispanic Asian adults. Vaccination coverage has consistently been higher among White and Asian adults compared to Black and Hispanic adults since the 2010-11 season. Efforts to increase access to influenza vaccination and improve vaccine confidence among racial and ethnic minority communities are crucial to reduce disparities in influenza vaccination and disease severity.
