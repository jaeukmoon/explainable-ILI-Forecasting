- Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 activity has increased globally since 2021, causing mass mortality in wild birds and poultry.
- There have been significant shifts in the origins of resurgent HPAI H5, with key events in 2016-2017 and 2020-2021 contributing to the emergence and spread of H5N1 in 2021-2022.
- Genomic analysis shows that the 2016-2017 outbreaks originated in Asia, where HPAI H5 reservoirs are endemic.
- In 2020-2021, H5N8 viruses emerged in African poultry with mutations altering HA structure and receptor binding.
- In 2021-2022, a new H5N1 virus evolved through reassortment in wild birds in Europe, further reassorting with low-pathogenic avian influenza in wild and domestic birds during global dissemination.
- The shift in the HPAI H5 epicenter beyond Asia suggests increasing persistence in wild birds, facilitating geographic and host range expansion, dispersion velocity, and reassortment potential.
- Elimination strategies in domestic birds are a priority to limit future outbreaks.
