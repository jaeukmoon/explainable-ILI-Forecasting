HPAI H5 infections of zoonotic origin also pose a threat to human health. Upon evaluating the global distribution of HPAI H5 viruses from 2019 to 2022, we found that the dominant strain of HPAI H5 rapidly changed from H5N8 to H5N1. A comparison of HA sequences from human- and avian-derived HPAI H5 viruses indicated high homology within the same subtype of viruses. Moreover, amino acid residues 137A, 192I, and 193R in the receptor-binding domain of HA1 were the key mutation sites for human infection in the current HPAI H5 subtype viruses. The recent rapid transmission of H5N1 HPAI in minks may result in the further evolution of the virus in mammals, thereby causing cross-species transmission to humans in the near future. This potential cross-species transmission calls for the development of an H5-specific influenza vaccine, as well as a universal influenza vaccine able to provide protection against a broad range of influenza strains.

It is caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) or low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses, which belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family and have a single-stranded negative-sense RNA genome. Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) are mainly classified on the basis of their surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). HA protein on the surface of the virion, the main antigenic site in vaccine design, causes erythrocyte agglutination in vitro and in vivo1. Over the years, outbreaks of HPAI H5 subtype viruses in poultry have caused huge economic losses to the farming industry. In 2022, more than 25 million poultry and wild birds were infected with HPAI H5 worldwide, resulting in 5.28 million deaths (https://wahis.woah.org/). Recently, HPAI H5 has caused more sporadic cases, or even outbreaks, in mammals, including minks, otters, foxes, and sea lions2,3,4. With possible further mutations in avian and mammalian species, HPAI H5 has a strong potential to cause human infection and trigger a global pandemic. Therefore, it is essential to develop an H5-specific vaccine, as well as a universal influenza vaccine, to fully cover a broad range of influenza strains.Global distribution of HPAI H5 virusesH5N1 was the first strain isolated among the HPAI H5 viruses in Scotland in 1959, and it was shown to infect a variety of avians5. In 1997, HPAI H5N1 (Gs/GD/96) emerged in China and it was first confirmed to infect humans6. In 2000, H5N1 broke out among poultry in several countries, including the Netherlands, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand7. A few years later (after 2005), H5N1 further spread to poultry in Europe and Africa8,9. Owing to homologous recombination among influenza strains in poultry, other non-N1 recombinant AIVs strains, such as H5N2, H5N6, and H5N8, have emerged in many countries. To classify H5 subtype AIVs, the HA gene was selected by the WHO/OIE/FAO H5N1 Evolution Working Group to divide AIVs into diffident clades based on the similarity of HA nucleic acid sequences. Each distinct clade was determined to have an average distance > 1.5% from other clades10. From 2013 to 2019, HPAI viruses of subclades 2.3.2.1 and 2.3.4.4 began to spread around the world11,12,13,14,15,16. HPAI H5 subclade 2.3.4.4 was first detected in domestic ducks in China17,18 and was further divided into 8 subclades, 2.3.4.4a to 2.3.4.4h19.From 2019 to 2022, HPAI H5 viruses have been circulating among avian populations in Europe, Africa, and Asia20,21,22,23,24, resulting in a significant increase in global avian cases from 0.343 to 25.19 million (Fig. 1). Europe has become the primary site of spread accounting for 82.7% of avian cases and 43.9% of deaths globally in 2022 (Fig. 2a). Notably, the main HPAI subtype virus causing global epidemics gradually changed from H5N8 to H5N1 between 2019 and 2022 (Fig. 2b). For example, the epidemic of HPAI viruses in Europe was dominated by H5N8 from 2019 to 2021. However, it changed to H5N1 in 2022. During this year, infections and mortality rates caused by H5N1 accounted for ~99.9% among all HPAI H5 viruses in the same period (Fig. 2c). Since 2019, the H5N1 subtype has been dominant in Africa and the Americas, accounting for more than 99.9% of cases (Fig. 2d, e). Similar to Europe, H5N8 was the main HPAI subtype in Asia from 2019 to 2021, but it also changed to H5N1 in 2022. In 2022, the H5N1 subtype accounted for 67.4% of infections and 76.3% of mortalities among all H5 subtypes in Asia (Fig. 2f).Fig. 1: Global distribution of HPAI H5 viruses is shown by avian cases and deaths from 2019 to 2022 (https://wahis.woah.org/#/dashboards/qd-dashboard).Data up to January 2023 are included. a Distribution of HPAI H5 viruses between 2019 and 2022 based on the number of infections. b Number of avian infections and deaths caused by HPAI H5 viruses from 2005 to 2022.Full size imageFig. 2: Global distribution of HPAI H5 avian infections from 2019 to 2022.a Distribution of HPAI H5 in Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas. b Global distribution of each subtype of HPAI H5. c–f Continent-specific distribution of each subtype of HPAI H5. Raw data for avian cases and deaths were taken from WAHIS (https://wahis.woah.org/#/dashboards/qd-dashboard). Data are included up to January 2023.Full size imageHuman infections with HPAI H5 virusesThe current global epidemic of HPAI H5 mainly involves three subtypes: H5N1, H5N8, and H5N6. Indeed, the widespread epidemic of AIVs among wild birds increases the risk of infection for poultry and other avians. However, it is generally believed that human infection with HPAI H5 viruses is closely related to outbreaks in poultry and wild birds, and according to the WHO, 864 human cases of H5N1 infection have been reported worldwide, resulting in 456 deaths from 2014 to 2021(Fig. 3a). It was previously believed that only cumulative mutations of AIVs in avians could lead to spillover, causing mammalian (or human) infections and deaths. Currently, no evidence of HPAI H5 transmission has been observed among mammals. However, H5N1 was recently detected in mink farms in the United States and Spain, and more than 50,000 mink were killed to prevent further spread2,3,4. These events provide strong evidence that HPAI H5 viruses can spread rapidly among mammals and that minks may serve as a potential intermediate host to increase the possibility of the H5N1 epidemic in humans. In fact, human infections caused by the HPAI H5 viruses have recently been reported in Ecuador, Cambodia, and Chile (https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2023-DON434; https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/spotlights/2022-2023/chile-first-case-h5n1-addendum.htm).Fig. 3: Global number of human cases of H5N1 and H5N8 infection.a Global number of human cases of H5N1 infection from 2003 to 2021 (https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/cumulative-number-of-confirmed-human-cases-for-avian-influenza-a(h5n1)-reported-to-who-2003-2023-3-march-2023). b Global number of human cases of H5N6 infection from 2014 to 2022 (https://search.fresh.gov.hk/chp/sc/search_result.php?q=influenza+virus&fq_yr=2023&fq_ct=&fq_ft=&sort=&page=1).Full size imageMore concerning evidence has been reported on human infection with the H5N6 subtype virus. From 2014 to 2022, 87 human cases of H5N6 infection were reported (86 in China and one in Laos), with most infections reported in 2021 and 2022 (Fig. 3b). The number of H5N6 infection cases in 2021 and 2022 accounted for 67% of the total number of infections from 2014 to 2022, suggesting that the Chinese government should strengthen protective measures to prevent further spread of the H5N6 virus. Additionally, the first case of H5N8 infection in humans was reported in Russia in 202025. The significant increase in human cases of H5N6 and the emergence of a new human case of H5N8 are alarming signs for human safety.Analysis of HPAI H5 HA sequences and assessment of the risk for human infection based on the infection data from 2019 to 2022In the process of viral infection, HA binds to sialic acid receptors on the cell surface and mediates the fusion of the viral membrane and the host endosomal membrane to deliver viral nucleic acid into the cytoplasm of host cells, thereby playing a key role in the process of infection. HA protein is hydrolyzed to produce HA1 and HA2. HA1 binds to cell receptors via the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and is prone to mutations, while HA2 mediates the membrane fusion process and is relatively conserved. The HA1 of AIVs binds to the α-2,3-sialic acid receptors in avian species, while it binds to the α-2,6-sialic acid receptors in humans. The difference in receptor usage partly prevents the transmission of AIVs from birds to humans. Therefore, we compared HA sequence, HA1 sequence, and RBD key sites of HPAI H5 viruses isolated from avians and humans in recent years to assess the potential risk of human infection.The amino acid sequences of HA proteins were derived from GISAID (https://gisaid.org/). The major HPAI H5 HA sequences from avian and human (Fig. 4) belong to subclades 2.3.4.4b (H5N1, H5N6, H5N8), 2.3.4.4h (H5N6) and 2.3.2 (H5N1). Notably, human infection was closely related to the outbreak of AIVs in avians since strains that caused both human and avian infections showed a close evolutionary relationship in all subclades of HPAI viruses, except for 2.3.2.1c. In addition, subclades 2.3.4.4b and 2.3.4.4h mainly broke out in Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Americas, while subclade 2.3.2 has only recently appeared in Egypt, South Asia, and other countries. HA1 amino acid sequences of HPAI H5 were highly homologous with only individual mutations, or even no mutations, for strains from different hosts, subtypes, and regions separated by time (Table 1). The HA1 sequence of human-derived H5N8 strain A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 was used as a reference sequence for comparison with the HA1 sequences of strains derived from humans or birds. It was surprising to find that the HA1 sequence of A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 from humans was identical to that of A/chicken/Kosovo/22-2 22VIR3124-13/2022 from avian. Moreover, only one amino acid (T192I) separated it from another avian-derived HA1 (A/whooper swan/Shanxi/4-1/2020), suggesting that these avian-derived strains hold a high risk for human infection. Most of these site differences in HA1 are located in the RBD region (E130D, A144T, V152L R173Q, T192I, and V214A). Previous studies have performed key amino acid mutations in RBD to analyze the effects on α-2,3/6-sialic acid affinities26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33. We collected these key amino acid mutations and compared them with the recent sequences from avian and human sources of the H5N1, H5N6, and H5N8 subtypes (Table 2).Fig. 4: Phylogenetic tree based on HA amino acid sequences of HPAI H5 viruses isolated between 2019 and 2022.These sequences were obtained from GISAID. The human-derived HPAI H5 sequences are marked in red. The phylogenetic tree was drawn with MEGA 11 obtained from https://megasoftware.net/.Full size imageTable 1 Differences in HA1 amino acid sequences between HPAI H5 virus derived from humans and avians.Full size tableTable 2 Comparison of key amino acid sites in the RBD region of HPAI H5 viruses.Full size tableRBD is located in the head of HA1 and contains 190-helix, 130-loop, 150-loop, 220-loop, and other amino acid residues26,34,35 (Fig. 5). Yang et al.36 found that the introduction of S137A and T192I mutations in the RBD of A/Thailand/KAN 1/2004 endowed this Avian strain with the ability to bind with α-2,6-sialic acid receptors present in humans. In our selected sequences, the 137A and 192I sites were found to be present in both human- and avian-derived H5N8 and H5N6 strains, indicating that they are key sites for cross-species transmission. In addition, although 192T exists in A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 (H5N8) and A/Fujian-Sanyuan/21099/2017 (H5N6), these strains still retain the ability to infect humans. This indicates that a single-site mutation (S137A/T) may also change the receptor-binding ability of AIVs. It has been reported that some mutation sites, such as the K193R mutation in the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 strain37, the Q196H mutation in the A/duck/Egypt/ D1Br12/2007 strain38, and the Q226L, S227N, and G228S mutations in the A/Indonesia/05/2005 strain39, can enhance the ability of stains to utilize the α-2,6-sialic acid receptor. In our selected sequences, the 193R site is present in both human- and avian-derived H5N1 strains, indicating that these H5N1 strains may have already gained the ability to utilize α-2,6-sialic acid receptors.Fig. 5: Structure of HA protein derived from HPAI H5 virus.a Trimeric HA is shown in cartoon representation with HA1 displayed in blue and HA2 in green. b Critical domains, including three loops and one helix, in RBD are shown in red in a single HA molecule. c Red domains in RBD (130-loop, 150-loop, 190-helix, and 220-loop) from b were enlarged and displayed with a sialic acid molecule (light green) in the groove. HA sequence of A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 was modeled by SWISS-MODEL and drawn by PyMOL software obtained from https://pymol.org/2/. The PDB number for the α-2,6-sialic acid molecule is 5E35.Full size imageAntiviral therapy for influenzaSome small-molecule compounds have been developed for the treatment of influenza viruses. These compounds target various stages of the viral life cycle, e.g., virus adsorption, fusion, nucleic acid release, nucleic acid replication, and virus budding. HA protein inhibitors block virus adsorption or fusion, which can be divided into HA1 and HA2 inhibitors. HA1 inhibitors, such as Dextran sulfate and DSA18140, block the binding of HA1 to receptors on the cell surface. Meanwhile, HA2 inhibitors like arbidol41 and BMY-2770942 block virus entry by preventing HA2-mediated membrane fusion. In addition, Basu et al. identified two small-molecule compounds, MBX2329 and MBX2546, which were able to bind to the stem region of the HA trimer and inhibit HA-mediated fusion43. The fusion process of the influenza virus also depends on endosomal acidification and a series of host enzymes, like proteases. Therefore, inhibitors of these host enzymes have also been developed as anti-influenza drugs, such as bafilomycin A144 and aprotinin45. After membrane fusion, viral RNA enters the host cell through the M2 ion channel. M2 inhibitors like amantadine and rimantadine, which block ion channel activity, were developed to prevent the release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. M2 inhibitors are effective for the influenza A virus but not for the influenza B virus because of its lack of M2 protein. It has been reported that S31N mutation is the main culprit causing resistance to M2 inhibitors, thus accounting for 92% of drug-resistant strains in the United States46. Consequently, M2 inhibitors are currently not recommended for treatment. NA protein is related to the maturation and release of viruses, and it plays an important role in regulating receptor binding and virus budding. NA inhibitors, such as oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir, can effectively inhibit the release of progeny viruses from infected cells47,48. However, amino acid mutations in the NA protein, e.g., E119A, H274Y, and N294S, usually lead to resistance to NA inhibitors49,50. Furthermore, viral nucleic acid replication inhibitors include PB2 inhibitors (VX78751), PA inhibitors (flutamide52 and Baloxavir53), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) inhibitors (Favipiravir54), and NP inhibitors (nucleolin55).In addition, some monoclonal antibodies (Mab) have been developed and are highly anticipated for post-exposure prophylaxis and clinical treatment. For example, a novel humanized Mab 8A56 neutralized H5N1 by binding to two types of epitopes on HA. Li et al. described a chimeric Mab, termed C12H5, which could neutralize representative strains of H1N1 circulating from 1991 to the present; it could even cross-neutralize H5N157. It has been reported that neutralizing antibodies against HA, isolated from volunteers vaccinated with seasonal influenza vaccines, could protect mice from H1N1 and H3N2 viruses in vivo58. Recently, the FDA confirmed that humanized polyclonal antibody SAB-176 could recognize multiple epitopes and provide protection against multiple influenza virus strains (https://ir.sab.bio/static-files/b332c893-5795-4d05-af96-a9ebcd917f24). A phase 2b clinical trial is about to be launched in patients with high-risk severe diseases. Some polypeptide drugs, such as EB-peptide59, iHA60, FluPep61, NDFRSKT62, P163, and P9R64, have also been developed against influenza viruses. However, the accumulation of mutations in AIVs still increases the probability of immune evasion65,66. Therefore, updating existing antiviral drugs cannot keep pace with the continuous variation of AIVs. This calls for new antiviral strategies, such as drugs and therapeutic Mabs targeting more conserved viral epitopes or cytokines, or immunomodulatory drugs, in response to emerging strains with epidemic potential43,67.Development of H5-specific influenza vaccinesCurrently, the main types of avian influenza vaccines include inactivated recombinant vaccines, subunit vaccines, viral vector vaccines, and DNA vaccines. Inactivated vaccines were previously the primary means of preventing influenza and were mainly prepared from low pathogenicity strains isolated from farms68. However, traditional inactivated vaccines are not conducive to vaccine production owing to such defects as dependence on embryo culture and low virus titer. At present, the vaccines used for H5 and H7 avian influenza in China are mainly recombinant inactivated vaccines. These vaccines are prepared by co-transfecting Vero cells with the viral RNA expression plasmid of HA and NA genes of the current epidemic strains and six internal genes (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, and NS) of PR8 (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934), together with four PR8 protein expression plasmids (PB2, PB1, PA, and NP)69. The basic terminal sequence R/KRRKR of HA from the HPAI virus was modified to RETR, endowing the recombinant virus with both the epitope of the pandemic strain and the high-titer characteristics of PR8 chicken embryo adaptation. The team led by Dr. Hualan Chen in China has developed a series of recombinant vaccines for the prevention of HPAI H5, among which Re-13 (A/duck/Fujian/S1424/2020 H5N6 2.3.4.4h) and Re-14 (A/whooper_ swan/Shanxi/4-1/2020 H5N8 2.3.4.4b) were developed in 202270. According to Chen et al.71, the H5N1 AIV strain bearing the subclade 2.3.4.4b HA gene was isolated from China in 2021–2022 and exhibited antigenic sites similar to those of H5-Re14. Since this type of recombinant vaccine is widely used in China, it plays a crucial role in the prevention and control of AIVs. WHO updated its AIV strain recommendations in 2022 and selected A/Astrakhan/3212/2020 H5N8 2.3.4.4b, A/Guangdong/18SF020/2018-like H5N6 2.3.4.4h and A/Fujian-Sanyuan /21099/2017-like H5N6 2.3.4.4b as candidate vaccine strains (https://www.who.inteams/global-influenza-programme/vaccines/who-recommendations).Development of universal influenza vaccinesAs AIV is a single-stranded RNA virus, its nucleic acid sequence is prone to mutation, thereby reducing the protective efficacy of the vaccine over time. Although it is possible to predict the next dominant strain for vaccine strain selection, production, and distribution, the circulating strain may further mutate, resulting in a decrease in vaccine protection efficiency. Therefore, it is necessary to develop universal influenza vaccines that target more conservative epitopes to counter potential antigenic drift or shift in AIVs. Accordingly, scientists have focused on several common targets for the development of universal influenza vaccines, including the conserved stalk domain of HA protein, the conserved regions of NA protein, the ectodomain of M2 ion channel (M2e), and the internal proteins, nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix protein 1 (M1). The aim is to expand existing immune memory response by multiple immunizations in order to produce the widest range of protective antibodies against different subtypes of influenza virus72.Effective humoral heterosubtypic immunity is rare, mainly based on antibodies targeting the HA stalk domain73,74. As mentioned, the RBD region in the head of HA protein is prone to mutations leading to viral immune evasion, while the HA stalk domain is rarely exposed to neutralizing antibodies, thus facing less selection pressure from the host immune system. As a result, the HA stalk domain is highly conserved in AIVs, making it an attractive target for universal vaccine design. A strategy for inducing high levels of stalk-reactive antibodies is based on chimeric HAs (cHAs), which combine exogenous head domains with conserved stalk domains. The cHAs with different head domains have been used in sequential vaccination programs to break the immunodominance of the head domain of HA and induce high titers of stalk-reactive antibodies75. However, the vaccine targeting the conserved stalk domain of HA can only produce cross-protection that occurs between strains within the same subtype or multiple subtypes of the same group, making it difficult to induce broadly reactive antibodies against influenza viruses across different groups. However, the construction of chimeric HA stalk domain with other conserved antigens, such as M2e, could improve cross-protection against multiple AIVs from different groups and improve the broad protection of universal influenza vaccines76. Chen et al. 77 have reported that influenza virus infection induces high titers of NA-reactive antibodies, which effectively inhibit the enzymatic activity of NA and provide robust prophylactic protection against avian H5N1 viruses in vivo. This observation suggests that some conserved regions in NA recognized by NA-reactive antibodies could be incorporated into influenza vaccines to elicit durable and broad protection against divergent influenza strains.Emerging vaccine platforms can help trigger a better immune response than that induced by traditional influenza vaccines. For example, virus-like particles (VLPs) can present natural conformational antigens, stimulate the immune system through a virus-like pathway, and efficiently induce immune protection. An H5N1 VLP-based vaccine, designed with computationally optimized broadly cross-reactive antigen (COBRA), elicits broadly reactive antibodies in mice and ferrets. Therefore, this strategy is potentially paradigm-shifting for H5 universal influenza vaccines78. A candidate universal influenza vaccine, which uses M2e-based VLP to present M2e, has been shown to protect mice from homosubtypic and heterosubtypic AIVs79. In addition, nanoparticle platforms have been used to develop universal influenza vaccines owing to their dominance in expressing antigens at high densities and providing adjuvant-like functions. For example, the OVX836 vaccine is based on oligomerized nanoparticles (NPs) that can induce humoral and cellular immunity in mice and ferrets, thereby providing protection against influenza A and B80,81. A ‘mosaic’ quadrivalent influenza vaccine based on two-component nanoparticle immunogens not only showed better protective antibody response than the 2017–2018 quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) but also triggered heterosubtypic antibody response and protective immunity in several animal models82. Viral vector-based vaccines can be delivered through both systemic or mucosal routes to trigger strong humoral and cellular immunity. An adenovirus vector-based H5N1 conserved multi-epitope influenza vaccine showed broad immune protection against H5, H7, and H9 influenza viruses in mice83. The nucleic acid platform includes DNA- and mRNA-based vaccines, which can respond quickly to emerging outbreaks. Based on their novel contribution to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, mRNA-based vaccines have become the focus of new vaccine technologies. Freyn et al. 84 demonstrated the broad protective effect of nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP vaccines based on conserved antigens (HA, NA, NP, and M2) against influenza virus challenge in mice. Koen et al. 85 evaluated heterosubtypic protection from a nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine that encodes the conserved NP, M1, and PB1 (polymerase basic protein 1) of one H1N1 strain. This vaccine induced a broadly reactive T-cell response in ferrets. Recently, Arevalo et al.86 developed an mRNA-LNP vaccine encoding HA from 20 known influenza A and B virus subtypes, and it triggered high levels of cross-reactivity and subtype-specific antibodies in mice and ferrets. This is a new antigen design concept for developing a universal influenza vaccine.In addition, new vaccine adjuvants support ideas for universal vaccine design. Appropriate vaccine adjuvants can improve immunogenicity, regulate immune response types, and even enhance the universality of vaccine protection87,88. Only 6 new adjuvants have been approved by the FDA in the past century, including MF59, AS04, AS03, AS01, CpG1018, and Matrix-M adjuvants for emergency use in COVID-19. MF59 and AS03 have improved the protective efficiency of influenza vaccines73,89. More prominently, the quadrivalent influenza nanoparticle vaccine (qNIV) with Matrix-M has been shown to enhance antigen presentation, expand the antibody epitope library, boost cross-neutralizing antibody responses, and improve the induction of potent CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in a variety of cells90. It has now successfully completed key phase III trials. Compared with adjuvant-free vaccines, influenza vaccines with adjuvants have shown higher immunogenicity and effects on heterologous strains. The 2′,3′-cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) is an effective natural agonist of stimulator of interferon genes (STING), which induces type I interferon (IFN-I) response and proinflammatory cytokine production by activating STING91,92. Wang et al.93 demonstrated intranasal immunization with the PS-cGAMP-adjuvanted inactivated H1N1 vaccine, which triggered a strong protective effect against different subtypes of influenza (H3N2, H5N1, and H7N9) in mice. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the emerging non-nucleotide small-molecule STING agonist CF501 showed higher protective efficacy compared to the cGAMP-adjuvanted vaccine, suggesting that CF501 can also be used as an adjuvant to boost the original vaccine for effective, extensive and long-term immune protection94.In this article, we have analyzed the global epidemic of HPAI H5 and revealed that the number of infections has risen significantly in recent years. Furthermore, it has been observed that the dominant HPAI virus worldwide rapidly changed from H5N8 to H5N1 in 2022. According to the sequence alignment analysis of HA1, we found that the HA1 sequences of strains isolated from avians and humans were highly homologous or even identical, suggesting that the existing AIVs strains circulating in birds may infect humans. Amino acids 137A, 192I, and 193R in the RBD of HA are key sites that exist in both avian and human source sequences. These sites enable the current HPAI H5 strains to bind α-2,6-sialic acid receptors in humans, indicating that the mutated HPAI H5 viruses may have jumped from birds to mammals and that such spillover may cause human infection.It should be mentioned that receptor affinity is not the only factor affecting the transmission of AIVs in humans. In the process of viral infection, HA mediates membrane fusion between the virus and host cells95. Next, nucleic acid is released with the assistance of the M protein and enters the nucleus to complete viral replication in the presence of viral polymerases PA, PB1, and PB2. Finally, the progeny virus is released from infected cells with the assistance of the NA protein. Many HPAI H5 viruses can enter host cells, but they cannot replicate successfully owing to the difference in amino acids at position 627 of PB2 protein, namely glutamic acid in AIVs and lysine in human influenza virus96. Hence, mutations in the RBD domain may only affect receptor binding and cell entry of AIVs, while replication efficiency of the virus in cells must be assisted by other viral proteins, such as PA, PB1, PB2, and NA, to gain successful cross-species transmission97. Therefore, mutations in these proteins and homologous recombination between strains deserve more attention.Nowadays, the HPAI H5 virus belonging to the 2.3.4.4b subclade is widespread among wild birds and poultry worldwide, resulting in significant economic losses. The prevention and control strategy for the HPAI H5 virus in Europe and North America mainly relies on culling, while the strategy in China is “vaccine and culling”. The latter strategy did reduce HPAI H5 virus infections in avians in China (Fig. 1a)25. In addition, after vaccination of the H5/H7 vaccine in poultry, the isolation of H7N9 strains in China decreased by 93.3%, which largely prevented the prevalence of H7N9 among poultry98. The transmission modes of HPAI H5 among wild birds, poultry, and mammals also deserve more attention. Wildfowl is the natural host of the HPAI H5 virus, and the virus usually replicates in their intestines and respiratory tract. Nine major routes have been identified for migration across the world, increasing the likelihood of AIV infection in poultry and mammals99,100. Therefore, understanding the temporospatial characteristics and as well as environmental factors of HPAI H5 outbreaks is helpful for establishing an effective prevention and control system101. It is widely accepted that AIVs only infect mammals through avian transmission and that no reports have so far indicated its spread among mammals. Nonetheless, the recent spread of the H5N1 virus in mink has sounded the alarm for human safety2,3,4. Prevention should be emphasized in virus-susceptible areas, and measures should be taken to reduce human exposure to birds and mammals in order to minimize the risk of zoonotic infections. Protective measures and preventive vaccination should be taken seriously for populations susceptible to occupational hazards. Finally, real-time virus monitoring and rapid data sharing are crucial for assessing the risk of cross-species transmission of HPAI H5 and implementing effective prevention and control measures. The antigenic drift of the current epidemic strains should be monitored, and it should be determined whether the existing vaccines still have protective effects. Furthermore, H5-specific vaccines need to be developed, and the team led by Hualan Chen in China, whose work was noted above, serves as a model in this regard71,102,103.While small-molecule compounds, peptides, and antibodies have been developed for influenza antiviral therapy, the constant mutation of the virus and its ability to evade immune response confound these efforts. Therefore, drugs and vaccines must be regularly updated to address the emergence of new strains. In response, scientists are trying different methods to develop universal vaccines against multiple subtypes of influenza viruses. HA is the main immunogen for vaccine design and mainly induces antibodies against the RBD region at the spherical head of HA, which is also highly prone to mutation. However, some cross-protective antibodies against highly conserved HA stalk may also be induced104. Emerging vaccine platforms and new vaccine adjuvants also provide pathways toward improving vaccine efficacy. Although not emphasized in this review, the potential of cross-reactive T cell-based responses for influenza vaccine design cannot be ignored. Currently, avian influenza vaccines are mandatory for poultry immunization. However, they are not included in routine human immunization but are only used as a preventive vaccination strategy during emergencies. HPAI H5 viruses are circulating in birds and have even caused outbreaks in mammals in recent years, thus raising concerns about HPAI H5 infections in humans. Heterologous prime–boost immunization strategies against H5N1 could induce broader cross-clade antibody responses. It is also worth considering priming with a universal vaccine and boosting with a specific vaccine against the current pandemic strain. ReferencesTonegawa, K. et al.

WeidmannDaniel A. GreenGregory J. BerryFann Wu*Department of Pathology & Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, United StatesIntroduction: In the Northeast US, respiratory viruses such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which were largely suppressed by COVID-19-related social distancing, made an unprecedented resurgence during 2022, leading to a substantial rise in viral co-infections. However, the relative rates of co-infection with seasonal respiratory viruses over this period have not been assessed.Methods: Here we reviewed multiplex respiratory viral PCR data (BioFire FilmArray™ Respiratory Panel v2.1 [RPP]) from patients with respiratory symptoms presenting to our medical center in New York City to assess co-infection rates of respiratory viruses, which were baselined to total rates of infection for each virus. We examined trends in monthly RPP data from adults and children during November 2021 through December 2022 to capture the full seasonal dynamics of respiratory viruses across periods of low and high prevalence.Results: Of 50,022 RPPs performed for 34,610 patients, 44% were positive for at least one target, and 67% of these were from children. The overwhelming majority of co-infections (93%) were seen among children, for whom 21% of positive RPPs had two or more viruses detected, as compared to just 4% in adults. Relative to children for whom RPPs were ordered, children with co-infections were younger (3.0 vs 4.5 years) and more likely to be seen in the ED or outpatient settings than inpatient and ICU settings. In children, most viral co-infections were found at significantly reduced rates relative to that expected from the incidence of each virus, especially those involving SARS-CoV-2 and influenza. SARS-CoV-2 positive children had an 85%, 65% and 58% reduced rate of co-infection with influenza, RSV, and Rhino/enteroviruses, respectively, after compensating for the incidence of infection with each virus (p< 0.001).Discussion: Our results demonstrate that most respiratory viruses peaked in different months and present in co-infections less than would be expected based on overall rates of infection, suggesting a viral exclusionary effect between most seasonal respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, influenza and RSV. We also demonstrate the significant burden of respiratory viral co-infections among children. Further work is necessary to understand what predisposes certain patients for viral co-infection despite this exclusionary effect.1 IntroductionSince the start of COVID-19 pandemic 3 years ago, there have been over 750 million confirmed cases and estimates of 44% of the global population having been infected by the end of 2021. This has transformed global awareness of respiratory viral illness (Organization, G.W.H, 2020; Collaborators, 2022). Amidst a surge of research on SARS-CoV-2, there have also been a wealth of studies assessing the effect of co-infections, or secondary infections, in patients with COVID-19 (Alhumaid et al., 2021; Dao et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2021; Kinoshita et al., 2021; Sreenath et al., 2021; Alhumaid et al., 2022; Hedberg et al., 2022; Krumbein et al., 2023). For the first year of the pandemic, lockdown measures appeared to lower the incidence of most seasonal respiratory viruses (Uhteg et al., 2022), but gradual relaxation of these measures and social distancing norms have led to their re-emergence.In this setting, assays that can detect multiple respiratory viral and/or bacterial co-infections can play an important role in both treatment decisions and infection control measures. Multiplex molecular assays, such as the FilmArray™ Respiratory Panel v2.1 (RPP), have become increasingly popular due to their ability to rapidly assess for up to twenty pathogen-specific targets simultaneously (Andersson et al., 2014; Hanson and Couturier, 2016). There has been some controversy around the clinical utility of such panels for regular use in the outpatient pediatric setting, amidst concerns for diagnostic stewardship, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (Esposito et al., 2019; Hanson et al., 2020). More recently, there has been a shift in the role of multiplex polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) assays in rapidly differentiating cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection from other respiratory viruses for public health purposes, and to identify common and treatable viral etiologies such as influenza. However, the role of multiplex respiratory viral testing to assess viral co-infection, particularly the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with other respiratory viruses, has received relatively little attention.Multiplex PCR assays also represent a novel opportunity to study the interaction of viruses in real time as they move through human populations. Of all viral co-infections involving SARS-CoV-2, influenza has received the most attention, with a meta-analysis from early in the pandemic demonstrating an overall co-infection rate of 0.7%, but much higher rates in children (3.2%) (Dao et al., 2021). Yet children displayed a very different pattern of respiratory co-infection prevalence with a more recent metanalysis demonstrating the highest prevalence from RSV (1.7%) and rhinovirus (1.0%), with influenza as third most prevalent at only 0.5% of overall SARS-CoV-2 infections (Alhumaid et al., 2022). In contrast, another metanalysis looking at viral co-infections in all age groups found influenza overall ranking third amongst viral co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 (1.2% prevalence), with EBV (1.8%) and HHV6 (1.6%) being more common (Alhumaid et al., 2021). Several factors contribute to the diversity in the rates and types of viral respiratory co-infection seen, including the background rates of infection with each virus, mechanisms of viral exclusion or predisposition for co-infection. The advent of multiplex viral panels allows for relative ease in assessing the background rates of mono vs. co-infection for a given patient population, yet few studies have formally attempted this.By normalizing for the probability of mono-infection, when comparing the relative incidence of various forms of viral co-infection, we can therefore gain novel insights into viral interactions within human hosts that have thus far only been studied in animal models. Horemheb-Rubio et al. (2022) conducted such an examination of respiratory viral interactions from 2010-2019 in Europe found relatively few synergistic viral interactions, such as between influenza H3N2 and parainfluenza virus 4 or HCoV-NL63 and parainfluenza virus 1, and predominantly viral exclusion between influenza and RSV, rhinovirus and most parainfluenza viruses (Horemheb-Rubio et al., 2022). However, such an analysis has not been conducted on a pediatric population, which have been shown to have higher rates of respiratory viral co-infection (Dao et al., 2021; Chen and Er, 2022; Krumbein et al., 2023), in general, nor been conducted since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and therefore systematically assessed such viral co-infection dynamics in patients with SARS-CoV-2. The resurgence of respiratory viruses seen over the past two Northern Hemisphere winter seasons represents a unique opportunity to study their co-infection rates normalized to background mono-infection.2 Methods2.1 Study populationWe performed retrospective analysis of a total of 50,022 BioFire FilmArray™ Respiratory Panel v2.1 tests (noted as Respiratory Pathogen Panel or RPP) (BioFire® Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT, USA) were performed over November 1st, 2021 through December 31st, 2022 for 34,610 patients seen at one of several sites at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Our hospital has instituted policies wherein pediatric patients with upper respiratory symptoms who are seen in the ED and are planned for admission, or inpatients who develop respiratory symptoms, are screened with the BioFire Respiratory Pathogen Panel 2.1 [RPP]. Duplicate results were excluded from the analysis. For patients with multiple positive RPPs, each positive RPP was considered as a separate episode of infection, in order to include new targets detected throughout a patient’s hospital course or for different encounters. All RPP tests were performed using nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs on patients suspected of respiratory tract infection. Subsequent analysis was performed solely on the pediatric population, defined as age less than 18 years at time of NP swab collection.2.2 BioFire FilmArray™ Respiratory Panel v2.1Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected in viral transport media and analyzed with the BioFire FilmArray™ Respiratory Panel v2.1 as per the manufacturer’s instructions, which includes nucleic acid extraction, non-specific amplification, target-specific amplification, target detection and automatic interpretation of each target as detected, not detected or invalid from melting curve data by BioFire FilmArray™ software. The Panel consists of 21 targets, four of which are specific to bacteria (Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae) and the remaining specific for viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, influenza viruses (A, B, A H3, A H1 2009 variant), RSV, parainfluenza viruses (types 1-4), human rhinovirus/enterovirus, human metapneumovirus (HMpv), and non-SARS coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1).2.3 Data analysisData were imported from Cerner (Kansas City, MO) using Discern Analytics 2.0 software. Raw data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel. R Studio (Posit Software, PBC) was used for additional statistical analyses including Chi-squared testing to assess for significance between categorical variables, and Pearson correlation coefficients were used to examine the linear correlation between monthly incidence of viral co-infections. Viral predisposition or exclusion of co-infection with another virus was assessed by comparing the probability of co-infection involving viruses X and Y with the probability of random co-incidence of each viral infection in the same individual as described in (Horemheb-Rubio et al., 2022). While these authors calculated their “co-infection exclusion score” initially for each month of data ((Horemheb-Rubio et al., 2022), supplemental 1.1), and then compiled monthly values into one composite score, here we calculated a similar ratio from our full dataset. If this Viral Co-infection Ratio (VCR) value equals 1, the chance of co-infection is the same as expected from the incidence of each virus, values less than 1 represent a reduced chance of co-infection relative to expected and values greater than one represent an increase relative to expected. We calculated the percent change in probability relative to expected for a particular viral co-infection pair via the equation:(−1 + VCR)*1003 Results3.1 Increased rates of RPP positivity and co-infection in pediatric patientsWhile children (<18yrs) represented a minority of patients tested by RPP (45.3%, Table 1), and a minority of RPPs tested overall were in children (47.0%), they represented a significantly higher proportion of patients with positive RPP (at least one target positive) (69.6%, p<0.001) as well as positive RPPs overall (71.8%, p< 0.001; Table 1). RPP ordering rates were similar in pediatric patients relative to adults (1.5 vs. 1.4 RPPs/patient), indicating that repeat RPP ordering for a single patient was not frequent both amongst children and adults, however pediatric patients had a three-fold higher rate of positive RPPs per patient (15,790/15,675 = 1.01) relative to adults (6,211/18,935 = 0.33) (p< 0.001).TABLE 1 Table 1 RPP ordering, positivity and co-infections.The overall RPP positivity rate was 2.7-fold higher in children relative to adults (67.1% vs. 23.4%, p< 0.001). Further, the percentage of positive RPPs with multiple targets detected (co-infections) in pediatric patients (20.7%, 3,263/15790) was 5.3-fold higher relative to adults (3.9%, 242/6211) (p< 0.001), with significantly higher proportions of two, three and four target-positive RPPs in pediatric patients (Figure 1B). Most positive RPPs contained a single target positive, both for overall and pediatric patients (Table 1; Figure 1A).FIGURE 1 Figure 1 Proportion of positive RPPs that were positive for a single vs. multiple viral targets. (A) Pie chart comparing percentage of mono-infection (single target positive) vs. co-infection (two or more targets positive) out of total positive RPP in the pediatric patient population. (B) Pie chart comparing the percentage of RPPs positive with two or more targets positive out of the total number of RPPs with multiple targets (presumed co-infections) in the pediatric patient population.3.2 Demographic characteristics of pediatric patients with RPPThe majority of pediatric patients with RPPs ordered were younger than 5 years of age (mean 4.5 years ± 0.06 95% CI), with a trend of lower age for those with positive RPP (3.9 years ± 0.06 95% CI), and particularly those with multiple targets positive (mean 3.0 years ± 0.10 95% CI; Table 2). Pediatric patients with RPPs ordered, as well as positive RPPs, were significantly more likely to be male (p< 0.001 and p< 0.001), for whom there was also a trend towards a higher rate of co-infection (Table 2). The majority of RPPs for pediatric patients were ordered from the ED (65.0%; Table 2), with significantly higher proportions of positive results and co-infection among ED patients (p< 0.001), with corresponding decreases in positive RPPs and co-infections from inpatient units. When stratifying by location, positivity rates and co-infections were highest among outpatient clinics (93.5% and 20.8%, respectively).TABLE 2 Table 2 Positive Respiratory Pathogen Panel demographics and level of care in pediatric patients.3.3 Distinct trends in respiratory viral infections over time in pediatric patientsAssessing monthly trends, a wide range of positivity rates among pediatric patients was observed, following distinct seasonal patterns for most viruses (Figure 2). Rhinovirus/enterovirus demonstrated the highest incidence during all but two months of the study period and peaked in September 2022 (Figure 2A). SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated peaks in January and July-August 2022, whereas seasonal coronaviruses peaked in March-April 2022. Influenza viruses peaked in April-May and December 2022, while metapneumovirus (HMpv) and parainfluenza viruses peaked in June 2022, and RSV peaked in November 2022.FIGURE 2 Figure 2 Trends overall viral infections in patients with RPP. (A) The number of total positive RPPs from each viral category are reported for each month of the study period. (B) The percentage of total RPPs ordered each month that were positive for each viral category was plotted for each month of the study period. Rhino/enterovirus was excluded for purposes of visualization. The influenza category refers to RPPs positive for any of the influenza A (non-subtyped), influenza A H3, influenza A H1 2009, and influenza B targets. The parainfluenza category refers to RPPs positive for any of the parainfluenza viruses 1-4. The Non-SCV-2 category refers to RPPs positive for any of the targets specific for HKU1, NL63, OC43 or 229E Coronaviruses.Pairwise Pearson correlations between each of the viral categories depicted in Figure 2 (Table 3) were assessed. Of 28 pairwise correlations, 17 were negative (inverse) and 11 were positive. SARS-CoV-2 showed a strong negative correlation (defined as<-0.5) with Rhino/enterovirus and a moderately negative correlation with seasonal coronaviruses (between -0.3 and -0.5). Influenza showed moderate positive correlations with RSV, adenovirus and seasonal coronaviruses, but a moderate negative correlation with rhinovirus/enterovirus. There was also a strong negative correlation between adenovirus and rhinovirus/enterovirus, as well as strong positive correlations between adenovirus and seasonal coronaviruses, as well as HMpv and parainfluenza viruses (Table 3).TABLE 3 Table 3 Pearson Correlation in viral incidence trends over study period.3.4 SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates viral exclusion and low rates of respiratory viral co-infectionWe found a wide variety of co-infection relative to overall infection percentages for individual viral categories, ranging from 59.6% (adenovirus) to 26.2% (SARS-CoV-2, Figure 3). SARS-CoV-2 showed a significantly lower co-infection proportion than every other viral category, except it did not have a significantly lower co-infection rate than influenza, which was next lowest at 27.4%. Adenovirus had a significantly higher co-infection proportion than every other viral category, including seasonal coronaviruses, which had the next highest co-infection proportion at 48.7% (p< 0.01).FIGURE 3 Figure 3 Rates of mono-infection vs. co-infection by virus. The percentage of total RPPs positive for each viral category, positive for only a single target (presumed mono-infection) or multiple targets (presumed co-infection) are listed for each viral category. p-values correspond to airs of specific viral categories. *p< 0.05, **p< 0.01, ***p< 0.001.These findings aligned closely with our comparison of the probability of specific viral co-infections, relative to the probability of co-infection based on the random interaction of each virus involved, based on their overall prevalence in the study population (Figure 4). SARS-CoV-2, which had the lowest co-infection proportion (Figure 3), was found to have a significantly decreased probability of co-infection with every other type of respiratory virus assessed. Amongst co-infections with SARS-CoV-2, the greatest effect was seen with influenza, where there was an 86% lower than expected probability of co-infection, and the least effect with adenovirus, with a 30% reduction from expected (Figure 4). Influenza also demonstrated a significantly lower probability than expected of co-infection with any other virus assessed, from the highest probability with adenovirus, as a 21% reduction from expected, to the lowest with SARS-CoV-2. RSV demonstrated viral exclusion with every other category except adenovirus, with no significant difference from expected, and the largest reduction in probability was seen with HMpv at -79.9%. In general, most viral pairs assessed showed lower-than-expected probability of co-infection, except for adenovirus with seasonal coronaviruses, with a 39.9% increase from expected, while there was no significant difference from the expected co-infection probability for adenovirus co-infection with RSV, rhinovirus/enterovirus, and HMpv (Figure 4). Of note, we did not assess several viral pairs for whom there was no significant Pearson correlation coefficient seen (Table 2)FIGURE 4 Figure 4 Pediatric co-infection probability relative to expected based on overall infection rate. The probability of viral co-infection was calculated based on the overall incidence of each co-infection pair, and compared to the expected probability of each co-infection type based on the incidence of each virus category as would be expected from stochastic interactions (random chance). *p< 0.05, **p< 0.01, ***p< 0.001. ns, not significant.4 DiscussionThis study is the first since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic to assess respiratory viral co-infections while controlling for viral incidence in pediatric patients. Interestingly, our findings indicate that most common respiratory viruses are found in co-infection much more rarely than would expected based on their overall incidence. This finding is consistent with the assessment of incidence rates of individual RPP viral categories on a monthly basis, which demonstrated distinct peaks in incidence for each viral category, except for parainfluenza and HMpv. SARS-CoV-2, which has never been assessed by this method of estimating viral interactions in human subjects, was found to have a particularly high tendency for viral exclusion in all the viral categories assessed here. Influenza and RSV also demonstrated viral exclusion or no interaction for all viruses tested.Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection in the hospitalized US pediatric population showed similarly low rates during the 2021-2022 influenza season as we saw for our overall pediatric patient population who received RPP, with 5.6% and 5.4% of influenza patients demonstrating SARS-CoV-2 co-infection, respectively (Adams et al., 2022). Despite this low co-infection rate, national data have demonstrated that co-infection carries a far higher risk of mortality, with the mortality rate of co-infected pediatric inpatients nearly three-fold higher (21.9%) than those infected with influenza alone (7.7%) (Adams et al., 2022). While there was no significant difference in rates of anti-viral therapy for patients hospitalized with co-infection vs. influenza alone, only one of the seven (14%) children who died with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza co-infection had received antiviral therapy for influenza, relative to 46% in the influenza-only population (Adams et al., 2022). Early administration of anti-influenza therapy may therefore be an even more significant factor for survival of co-infected patients. Hospitalized pediatric patients with influenza and SARS-CoV-2 co-infections also had significantly lower rates of influenza vaccination (17%) relative to those with influenza alone (42%, p = 0.02) (Adams et al., 2022). These national data therefore complement our findings of a high degree of viral exclusion between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza, and suggest that the relatively few patients who develop co-infection may represent a particularly susceptible segment of the pediatric population, with reduced immunity to influenza.Most studies have found comparably low rates of viral co-infection in adult populations as those we present here. For example, Chen and Er (2022) characterized FilmArray™ RP results from 804 Emergency Department patients in Taiwan, with 27.9% having positive results, 5.3% of patients having co-infection, but only two co-infections involving SARS-CoV-2, with the plurality of co-infections involving Adenovirus and Rhino/Enterovirus (42%) (Chen and Er, 2022). However, these authors did little to examine the rates of specific viral co-infections relative to the frequency each virus was encountered, or to explore correlations between the incidence of specific viral co-infections. A recent metanalysis of viral co-infections in the setting of COVID-19 found a similar rate of co-infection (5.0%) (Krumbein et al., 2023), but the most prevalent co-infecting virus was influenza (1.5%), followed by enterovirus (1.3%), and co-infections were more common in children (9.4%) than adults (3.5%). However, this meta-analysis was conducted on studies published from late 2019 to August 2021, and therefore did not include the most recent two respiratory viral seasons (Krumbein et al., 2023). Similarly, rates of respiratory viral co-infection among COVID-19 patients have been consistently higher in children, with one study reporting up to 15.8% for hospitalized patients, and 33.9% among children less than 5 years of age (Wanga et al., 2021), consistent with the findings in our study.One limitation of the present study is the inability to distinguish the timeline of multiple infections, with each RPP datapoint representing a snapshot in time. Therefore differentiating superinfection vs. early co-infection was not possible. This makes it more challenging to determine which viruses from co-infected patients increased or decreased the likelihood of infection with another virus, or whether other factors, such as ineffective clearance of a virus, may have been responsible for affinity interactions seen. We suspect that this latter scenario played a role in the overall increased rate of co-infection we saw for adenovirus, and the relatively low exclusion or increased affinity of adenovirus for other viruses. Schjelderup Nilsen et al. (2019) found higher positivity rates of adenovirus in healthy children relative to those with respiratory tract infection, though symptomatic children were significantly more likely to have only adenovirus DNA detected (mono-infection), grow adenovirus in culture and have higher adenovirus viral loads (Schjelderup Nilsen et al., 2019). These authors therefore concluded that qualitative PCR testing for adenovirus DNA alone was not useful in the pediatric population as a diagnostic test. Zadheidar et al. (2022) found similar rates of adenovirus positivity in both symptomatic children and healthy controls, but found different subtypes predominated in each population (Zadheidar et al., 2022). The increased rates of co-infection involving adenovirus seen here may therefore be partially attributable to asymptomatic colonization.We also cannot distinguish from our analysis whether reduced probability of viral co-infection was due to, or contributed to, distinct trends in monthly incidence in nearly each viral category assessed over the study period. Due to the limited number of co-infections for some targets, such as individual parainfluenza viruses, coronaviruses, and influenza viruses, their incidence was combined by group, which prevents assessment for specific viruses within each category, such as some of those observed by Horemheb-Rubio et al. (2022). For example, these authors found increases in the probability of interaction between specific HPIV 4 and influenza A(H3N2), as well as HPIV 1 and HCOV-NL63, while we found overall decrease in the interaction probability of these viral categories, but were not able to assess affinity between specific viruses within each category (Horemheb-Rubio et al., 2022). Additionally, viral exclusion/affinity analysis was not performed for individual months in the dataset due to the relatively infrequent co-infections for a given month. However, when we focused on November 2022, a month in which SARS-CoV-2, influenza and RSV were all present at relatively high incidence, we found rates of co-infection of each viral pair comparably low as to results obtained for the full 14 months assessed by this study (Figure S1). Thus, viral co-infection of these viruses is present at rates far lower than would be expected during a month where each is present at high incidence, suggesting that some biological mechanism of viral exclusion or host response also plays a significant role. This may have reduced the sensitivity of our analysis of viral co-infection due to the non-linear relationship between the probability of co-infection and the monthly prevalence of each virus involvedIn contrast to the present study, affinity of adenovirus towards co-infection with seasonal coronaviruses was not observed by Horemheb-Rubio et al. Whereas the previous study observed a weak exclusionary interaction between adenovirus and RSV, rhinovirus/enterovirus, and parainfluenza, this interaction was not seen in the present study. However, a weak viral exclusion between adenovirus and both influenza and RSV was consistently observed in both studies (Horemheb-Rubio et al., 2022). The differences between the two studies could have stemmed from a variety of factors in addition to the methodological differences noted above, including differences in the pediatric host population, changes in viral interactions, viral immunity occurring in the setting of SARS-CoV-2, or other viral interactions that cannot be determined here. Further, the reduced incidence of overall viral infection, and particularly viral co-infection, seen for the adult population, did not allow for a robust comparison in the adult population. However, greatly reduced rates of all respiratory viral co-infections, even relative to overall infections in adults, suggests that viral exclusion may be even more common among adults. Though differences in RPP ordering practices make it likely that some proportion of this difference is from artifact due to the different clinical thresholds for which the test was used in these populations.In summary, the data presented here demonstrate that, despite the expectedly high rates of RPP positivity seen in the pediatric population, viral co-infection occurred significantly less frequently than would be predicted from viral incidence alone. However, viruses included in the panel displayed a range of predilections for co-infection, with Adenovirus and non-SARS-CoV2 Coronaviruses demonstrating the highest frequency of co-infection, while SARS-CoV2 and influenza demonstrated the lowest overall. The distinct peaks in positivity rate for each virus over the course of the study period suggest that low co-infection rates may be in part due to differences in their distribution over time, but biological exclusion of viruses present in the same population likely also play a significant role. Further study is necessary to distinguish to what extent low rates of viral co-infection seen here can be attributed to different temporal trends of viral incidence, biological mechanisms of viral exclusion or virally-induced changes in host immune defense.Data availability statementThe data analyzed in this study is subject to the following licensesestrictions: Data was extracted from our laboratory information system and has sensitive patient information.

If many people opt out of the flu vaccine this season, cases could rise. Adam Cairns/Columbus Dispatch/USA Today Network CNN — It’s only June, but scientists in the US are already thinking about flu season. As always at this time of year, they’re keeping a close eye on Australia, which saw an early start to its flu season. Some parts of the country are seeing a spike in illness, and the highest number of cases are among children. Those flu patterns could be an indicator of what’s to come in the US. In the US, flu activity is currently low, as it usually is this time of year. The Covid-19 pandemic made flu season a little less predictable, but people generally don’t start getting sick until around October, and doctors’ offices don’t get really busy until somewhere between December and February. Hispanolistic/E+/Getty Images How much you exercise may impact your flu and pneumonia risk, study shows In the Southern Hemisphere, where it’s now winter, cases began increasing “sharply” in early May, the Australian Department of Health and Aged Care said Friday. It’s an earlier start of the season than some years; case numbers are higher than the five-year average, the agency said, but lower than around this time in 2019 and 2022. Scientists are also watching the number of cases in kids. More children in Australia appear to be getting sick than other age groups this year. American scientists typically look to Australia and some other countries to try to anticipate exactly how bad the flu will get in the US during its fall and winter. “We closely monitor what happens in countries throughout the Southern Hemisphere this time of year, just to see what’s happening during their flu season. It’s not always a predictor of what’s going to happen here the next season, but yes, we do. We do closely monitor that all summer long,” said Carrie Reed, chief of the Influenza Division of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Epidemiology and Prevention Branch. Flu is an important virus to monitor because it makes so many people sick and costs the nation so much money. But some people may dismiss its seriousness because it is seasonal and everyone gets it at least once in their lifetime. The CDC estimates that the flu caused 9 million to 41 million illnesses, 140,000 to 710,000 hospitalizations and 12,000 to 52,000 deaths every year between 2010 and 2020. It costs the US about $10.4 billion in direct costs for hospitalizations and outpatient visits, the agency said, and that’s only among adults. For about a decade, Reed said, the CDC has had a formal forecasting effort that’s a collaboration with several academic groups and private industry that specialize in flu forecasting and modeling. The data comes from clinical labs, emergency departments, hospital networks and death certificates. Sick senior adult elderly asia women feeling unwell coughing with sore throat.Healthcare and medicine concept Adobe Stock Doctors say this is the most important virus you’ve never heard of The groups submit their flu data each week. The CDC compiles it, analyzes it and creates public reports that track the trends. The forecasts have become more useful over time, Reed said. “We’ve learned a lot, and we’ve improved a lot over the years,” she said. “Flu is a very interesting pathogen to deal with. Every flu season is a little bit different. The virus is constantly evolving. And so every year, it is a new challenge.” While hundreds of scientists and millions of dollars are dedicated to predicting what the US flu season could look like, data showing an early, intense season in Australia doesn’t necessarily mean the same on this side of the planet, computational scientist Thomas McAndrew said. Nor are prediction models so detailed that scientists could say there will be a spike in flu germs in, say, Chicago on September 12. “We only have a couple of days out on weather at best,” said McAndrew, an assistant professor in the Department of Community and Population Health at Lehigh University. “Flu is so difficult to predict because predicting what any infectious disease will do is predicting human behavior.” Humans do some predictable activities that spread the flu: Children go to school every fall; families travel to gather for the holidays. But thousands of people could also start wearing masks after seeing someone influential like Taylor Swift tweet a picture of herself wearing one in a city with high flu numbers, and a behavior change like that among enough people could cause flu case numbers to drop. “There’s so many things that go into predictions,” McAndrew said. “It would be nice if everyone was in the same room and everybody bounces and connects with everybody for the same period of time with the same weather, so we could precisely calculate how the flu would spread, but it doesn’t work that way. The way it spreads, it’s such a human thing.” It’s a multifaceted problem to predict the flu, the CDC’s Reed said. A healthcare worker administers a free flu shot vaccination to a patient at a YMCA location in Los Angeles, California, U.S., on Saturday, Sept. 26, 2020. The annual U.S. flu vaccine campaign has been cast into disarray by Covid-19, with people staying away from pharmacies, schools, offices, hospitals and other places where they typically get their shots. Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg/Getty Images The NIH is enrolling volunteers in an early-stage trial for an mRNA-based universal flu vaccine “It’s a mix of human behavior, social interactions, mobility, but also weather humidity, population immunity. So yeah, it’s complex.” This year too, the US could face an entirely new element that could change the trajectory of the virus, said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. “Looking at this fall, we are going to have a special challenge because, in addition to urging everyone to get their annual influenza vaccine, we’re going to have a new updated Covid vaccine that will be available. And in addition to that, two new RSV vaccines just have been licensed. And in a week and a half or so, the CDC’s advisory committee will provide recommendations as to who ought to get that vaccine, and it’s going to be at least older adults. So some people will be recommended to get not just one, not just two, three vaccines,” he said. Whether adults will actually go for all three shots remains to be seen. If many people opt out of the flu vaccine, cases could rise. Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Friday from the CNN Health team. Vaccinations have been a challenge since the pandemic. Covid-19 fueled what the World Health Organization called the “largest continued backslide in vaccinations in three decades” for children, not just for Covid vaccines but also for other lifesaving shots. That may be part of what is causing so many flu cases among Australia’s children, a spokesperson in the agency’s Department of Health and Aged Care said – not as many kids were getting vaccinated against the flu. So while Reed and her colleagues will be watching Australia’s flu numbers and running their calculations, it’s still not totally clear what 2023’s flu season will bring for the US. “It’s pretty early so far to predict what the upcoming season might be,” Reed said. “There’s lots of things that could change between now and when we start seeing more flu activity.” Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Live TV Listen Watch World Africa Americas Asia Australia China Europe India Middle East United Kingdom US Politics SCOTUS Congress Facts First 2024 Elections Business Tech Media Calculators Videos Markets Pre-markets After-Hours Fear & Greed Investing Markets Now Nightcap Health Life, But Better Fitness Food Sleep Mindfulness Relationships Entertainment Movies Television Celebrity Tech Innovate Foreseeable Future Mission: Ahead Work Transformed Innovative Cities Style Arts Design Fashion Architecture Luxury Beauty Video Travel Destinations Food & Drink Stay News Videos Sports Football Tennis Golf Motorsport US Sports Olympics Climbing Esports Hockey Watch Live TV CNN Fast Shows A-Z CNN10 CNN Max CNN TV Schedules Listen CNN 5 Things Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta The Assignment with Audie Cornish One Thing Tug of War CNN Political Briefing The Axe Files All There Is with Anderson Cooper All CNN Audio podcasts Science Space Life Unearthed Climate Solutions Weather Features As Equals Call to Earth Freedom Project Impact Your World Inside Africa CNN Heroes Weather Video Climate Ukraine-Russia War Israel-Hamas War About CNN Photos Investigations CNN Profiles CNN Leadership CNN Newsletters Work for CNN Health Watch Listen Live TV Follow CNN Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ad Choices Accessibility & CC About Newsletters Transcripts © 2024 Cable News Network.

Study: Broad-spectrum pan-genus and pan-family virus vaccines. Image Credit: peterschreiber.media/Shutterstock.com Background The coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to unprecedented efforts in vaccine research. Despite progress in vaccine development, multiple challenges persist. Moreover, COVID-19 has underscored the lack of a broadly protective universal vaccine that can be effective against several future variants. Research efforts in this direction are underway. In the present review, researchers discussed the development of broad-spectrum and pan-family and -genus vaccines, focusing on influenza, henipavirus, and CoV. Pan-henipavirus vaccines Henipaviruses fall into two categories – classical and non-classical henipaviruses based on the ability to utilize ephrin as the entry receptor. Animal or human sera after natural infection with Hendra (HeV) or Nipah (NiV) virus can cross-neutralize either virus, laying the foundation for the development of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and a pan-henipavirus vaccine. Whether a vaccine based on HeV or NiV would protect against other classical henipaviruses remains unclear. Vaccine candidates targeting the HeV or NiV glycoprotein have been effective in animal models. HeV soluble glycoprotein (sG)-based protein subunit vaccine, under the trade name Equivac HeV, has been licensed for use in horses. HeV and NiV sG-based vaccines provided homologous and heterologous protection against both viruses, although the HeV sG-based vaccine was better against NiV. These findings were confirmed in other animal models, and the HeV sG-based vaccine was selected for further development into a pan-henipavirus vaccine. Equivac HeV’s success as a pan-henipavirus vaccine mainly stems from using the highly conserved glycoprotein and strict receptor utilization, ensuring common neutralization targets. Four NiV vaccines are being developed based on the protein subunit and viral vector platform. Besides, a clinical trial for a messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based NiV vaccine is underway. Pan-influenza vaccine Existing inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs) target influenza A (IAV) and B (IBV) viruses that cause infections in humans. Although the IIV platform is still widespread and relatively the same after 80 years, the valency of the vaccine has increased over time. IIVs were re-developed based on bivalent, trivalent, and multivalent vaccine formulations. Genetic and antigenic characterization of circulating seasonal influenza viruses in humans and clinical and epidemiologic data can help determine the need for a vaccine strain update. Many strategies for a universal influenza vaccine are being evaluated in pre-clinical development, focusing on broadly neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against hemagglutinin. A 20-mer hemagglutinin mRNA lipid nanoparticle vaccine using all IAV and IBV subtypes was protective in ferrets and mice, with similar breadth across subtypes. There are 800 influenza vaccines currently in clinical trials, including eight multivalent vaccines, per the World Health Organization (WHO). Pan-CoV vaccine Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, middle-east respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 have caused epidemics and pandemics in the past two decades, resulting in unprecedented economic and human loss and global public health disruptions. No anti-CoV vaccine was approved for humans before the COVID-19 pandemic. Related StoriesRecruitment underway for a clinical trial testing new vaccine against respiratory virusesResearch suggests no need for yellow fever vaccine booster after initial doseUnraveling the psychological impact of COVID-19 on young mindsAlthough multiple vaccine candidates were developed for SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, none received regulatory approval for clinical evaluation. So far, the WHO has granted emergency use listing (EUL) for 11 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on whole inactivated virus, mRNA, adenovirus-vectored, and protein subunit platforms. These first-generation vaccines are based on the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain and are ineffective against novel immune-evasive variants such as the Omicron variant. Further, immune imprinting effects have been observed with vaccine breakthrough infections with the Omicron variant, wherein cross-reactive ancestral vaccine- or infection-elicited B cells are recalled. Still, de novo Omicron-specific nAbs or B cells are rarely induced. Thus, second-generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been developed. Moderna and Pfizer have introduced bivalent vaccines based on the ancestral strain and the Omicron variant. Bivalent vaccine-boosted individuals exhibited increased nAb response against Omicron sub-variants. As mentioned, due to immune imprinting, most recalled B cells target ancestral strain epitopes, with relatively fewer Omicron-specific nAbs. Therefore, research efforts are underway to develop broader third-generation pan-sarbecovirus vaccines. Most pan-sarbecovirus vaccines are under preclinical development. One of the vaccine candidates is based on the mosaic nanoparticle platform containing receptor-binding proteins (RBDs) from SARS-CoV-2 and seven animal CoVs. This vaccine elicited broad nAb responses in non-human primates and mice. Chimeric mRNA vaccines incorporating RBD, N-terminal domain (NTD), and the S2 domains of the spike protein from SARS-related CoVs have been reported to elicit pan-sarbecovirus immunity. No pan-CoV vaccine has yet been reported. Conclusion While there are reports of broad-spectrum nAbs against influenza viruses, CoVs, or henipaviruses, the structural characterization of their corresponding epitopes and, therefore, the vaccines targeting such epitopes are lacking. By contrast, many pan-variant, -sarbecovirus, -beta-CoV mAbs have been identified and characterized. Alternatively, given the ongoing development of pan-genus vaccines, it will be worth considering immunization with neutralizing mAbs as a universal antibody vaccine for early intervention in future outbreaks.

Telegram Facebook Copy Link Online Desk , ETHealthWorld Updated On Jun 15, 2023 at 01:28 PM IST Read by: 100 Industry Professionals Read by 100 Industry Professionals New Delhi: Highlighting a longstanding unmet need for more effective seasonal influenza vaccines, a recent study on influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) for the 2022-2023 season across six European countries has found vaccine effectiveness to be only 27- 44 per cent for influenza A and more than or equal to 50 per cent for influenza B.The current influenza vaccines only provide protection against a limited number of strains, with the strains predicted to be dominant in the upcoming season selected for inclusion in the vaccines. However, research into universal influenza vaccines is gaining precedence, with several of these candidates entering clinical development, says GlobalData. Advt Commenting on the universal influenza vaccine, Nusrat Haque, Infectious Disease Analyst, GlobalData, said, “The concept of a universal influenza vaccine is that it provides more durable protection against a wider variety of influenza strains than quadrivalent influenza vaccines, including unanticipated strains. In an ideal scenario, this should eliminate the need to develop influenza vaccines on an annual basis, freeing up resources and saving patients from the inconvenience of annual vaccinations. Ultimately one of the biggest benefits of a universal influenza vaccine is that it could help to contain a potential pandemic.”Few of these vaccines have already reached clinical development. For example, Imutex’s FLU-v has demonstrated positive results in protecting against the intranasal challenge of wild-type (H1N1)pdm09 influenza A virus in a Phase IIb trial, and Osivax’s OVX-836 provided protective efficacy in reducing influenza-like illnesses, confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in a Phase IIa trial, and is being evaluated in further Phase II studies.Haque continued, “GlobalData estimates that in 2022 the lab-confirmed seasonal influenza mortality rate across all ages was 1.24 per 100,000 in the US. However, a universal vaccine that confers immunity against a wide range of influenza strains could drastically reduce influenza-related hospitalization and mortality.” Advt The first mRNA-based universal vaccine, H1ssF-3928 mRNA-LNP, which was designed by the Vaccine Research Centre (VRC) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), has also recently advanced to Phase I clinical development in the US. The vaccine will be tested for safety and immunogenicity against an approved quadrivalent seasonal influenza vaccine.“The advantage of designing an mRNA-based universal influenza vaccine is that it could potentially be tested and produced quickly on a large scale, resulting in faster distribution to larger numbers of patients,” Haque concluded.

(Supplied: Pexels )abc.net.auews/what-is-the-difference-between-covid-19-the-flu-rsv-symptoms/102448856Link copiedShareShare articleHeard of the triple threat this winter?COVID-19, the flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are together driving a wave of respiratory illnesses.But all three have very similar symptoms that overlap. We help you zero in on which virus you might have.Wait, what's RSV again?It stands for respiratory syncytial virus, which causes respiratory infections.RSV is one of about 200 viruses that can cause a cold — which is very common. Most cases of illness caused by RSV are mild.But it can lead to serious illness for young children, the elderly and people with immunosuppressive conditions.Contracting the virus can lead to chest infections like bronchiolitis and pneumonia.It can also cause ear infections and the coughing associated with the illness can worsen asthma symptoms. What are the symptoms of RSV?Usually, the first symptoms are:FeverRunny noseCoughingWheezing or difficulty breathingDecreased appetiteTypically, most cases go away after about two weeks.But NSW Health says coughs associated with the virus can last for up to four weeks.Most cases of RSV are mild, but it can lead to serious illness in infants, the elderly and immunocompromised people. (ABC Riverland: Catherine Heuzenroeder)So what's the difference between COVID, RSV and the flu?All three have very similar symptoms that overlap.COVID, influenza and RSV are all respiratory diseases, says Professor Hassan Vally, an epidemiologist at Deakin University. However, Dr Vally says they have differences in the characteristics of the illnesses they cause, how they are transmitted and their impact."One of the most important differences between these diseases is who is the most susceptible to illness and severe disease," Dr Vally says. According to Dr Vally:COVID poses the biggest risk to those who are olderRSV poses the biggest threat to young childrenInflluenza poses the biggest threat to young children, older adults and pregnant women"All of these diseases pose an increased risk in individuals who have underlying health conditions or are immunocompromised regardless of age".He says a key way to differentiate among viral infections is to monitor how quickly your symptoms ramp up.What are the differences in symptoms?As with all viruses that infect the respiratory tract, the broad symptoms experienced are quite similar in most people, Dr Vally says."They include runny nose, cough, sore throat, sneezing and headache". These are the symptoms for each.Signs and symptomsCOVID-19RSVFluFeverSometimesSometimesCommonCoughCommonCommonCommonSore throatCommonSometimesSometimesShortness of breathSometimesSometimesRarelyFatigueCommonSometimesCommonLoss of taste and/or smellSometimesRarelySometimesBody aches/painSometimesRarelyCommonHeadacheCommonSometimesCommonStuffyunny noseCommonCommonSometimesDiarrhoeaRarelyRarelySometimes (in children)SneezingCommonSometimesNoVomiting SometimesRarelyCommon in childrenRare in adults Source: healthdirect/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionBut the only way to accurately determine which of these you might have is to get tested.Are there differences in testing?Yes, a few minor ones. Some pathology providers test for multiple viruses and may send you test results for RSV, influenza and COVID-19 at the same time.But this depends on your state and territory.COVIDRapid Antigen Tests (RATs) are available and can be purchased from pharmacies.Some state and territory governments may still provide Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests.Always check with your state or territory's health department for more information.RSVRSV is only able to be diagnosed by presenting to your general practitioner (GP).The virus can be identified by a PCR test (nose or throat swab), according to NSW Health. FluLoading Twitter contentIn case you missed the news, RAT tests are now available for the flu and COVID.The first of these combo home tests was approved in September 2022.Now several are on the market.These tests let you check, with one test kit, if you are:Infected with two types of flu (influenza A and B) and;SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID)The price of these combo kits advertised online varies from $8.95 to $59 (excluding delivery).So it's worth shopping around.Which age groups are more vulnerable?COVID-19Increasing age is the most important risk factor for severe disease and death, with risk significantly increasing around 60-70 years of age.The Department of Health and Aged Care says people who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated are also at greater risk.The risk of severe disease also increases for people with: Multiple and/or severe comorbiditiesPeople who are immunosuppressedPeople with a disabilityPeople experiencing frailtyAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoplePeople who are pregnantRSV"Most children will be infected with RSV at least once before they turn two," a Queensland Health spokesperson said."Infection provides some immunity to reinfection, so children under five years, but particularly infants less than six months of age are most at risk of severe outcomes".The following groups are also vulnerable to RSV: People aged 65 years and overPeople with multiple and/or severe comorbiditiesPeople who are immunosuppressed FluFor the flu, majority of at-risk groups are shared with COVID-19.However, children under five and adults aged 65 years and older are most at risk of severe outcomes.How do I protect myself?It's the same drill for all three viruses."In most cases, these diseases are mild and self-limiting," a federal Department of Health and Aged Care spokesperson says. According to them, it should be managed by:Staying home from school or workGetting plenty of restSaying hydratedManaging pain and fever with paracetamol or ibuprofenAvoiding interaction with people at greater risk, such as residents of aged careMaking sure you're up-to-date with vaccinations is also vital, says Dr Vally. "There are safe and effective vaccines available for COVID and influenza," he says."Now is a good time to get your COVID booster if you are due and to get your annual influenza vaccine".Dr Vally says if your symptoms are worsening or are severe, you should seek urgent medical attention."This is especially important for people in the higher risk groups".Loading...If you're unable to load the form, click here.Posted Tue 13 Jun 2023 at 8:01pmTuesday 13 Jun 2023 at 8:01pmTue 13 Jun 2023 at 8:01pm, updated Tue 13 Jun 2023 at 11:09pmTuesday 13 Jun 2023 at 11:09pmTue 13 Jun 2023 at 11:09pmShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesFamily of teacher's aide killed in preschool crash pay tribute to 'cherished mother, wife, daughter'Topic:Road Accidents and IncidentsPhoto shows Eleanor Bryant, who was killed when a truck crashed into a Victorian preschool, pictured smiling at the races.Barron Trump and AOC expose the problems with the Democratic campaignTopic:US ElectionsPhoto shows Barron Trump and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in a split screen image.

When people think of virology, rarely do they think of a week at the beach. However, one of the most consequential long-running virological expeditions traverses the East Coast — from Memphis to Delaware Bay every May — and has for the last 38 years. This year, this team of virus hunters took to the sand amid an ongoing avian influenza pandemic infecting wild and domestic birds. The current flu pandemic, which began in December 2021, has reportedly affected over 58 million birds across all 50 states in the U.S. and more in countries around the world — making this year’s expedition even more critical. On the first day of the trip, as the tide began to recede, the researchers lifted their binoculars, looking for signs of their targets. A rich source of virological treasure was soon to arrive. A vast flock of birds, including Red Knots (Calidris canutus), Sanderlings (Calidris alba), Ruddy Turnstones (Arenaria interpres) and Laughing gulls (Leucophaeus atricilla), descended on the beach and began their feast. They come to this spot along Delaware Bay in search of small, grain-thin greenish eggs present throughout the sand. The birds have traveled across continents for this over-easy buffet. Their migration coincides with the annual egg-laying of the horseshoe crab (Limus polyphemus), drawing hundreds of thousands of birds to feast on eggs on the beach. The scientists methodically follow behind the birds, collecting invaluable samples of bird stool, but more importantly, the viruses within them. Slide activated St. Jude scientists come to Delaware Bay and look for where horsehoe crabs (Limus polyphemus) are laying their eggs. Slide activated Once on the beaches, the St. Jude team, (left) Jon (Patrick) Seiler, (right) Jennifer DeBeauchamp-Newman, both of the St. Jude Department of Infectious Diseases, and (center) Pamela McKenzie, St. Jude Global Influenza Research and Surveillance director, look for the groups of birds that have come to feast on the horseshoe crab eggs. Slide activated A flock of ruddy turnstones (Arenaria interpres) is a promising place to look for influenza positive samples. Slide activated McKenzie and DeBeauchamp-Newman get their sampling equipment ready. Slide activated The birds leave easily recognized stool all over the beach. Two collection cotton swabs have been placed into the sand for scale. Slide activated One of the scientists collects samples with their right hand holding the cotton swab while having multiple tubes between each finger of their left hand to speed the process. Slide activated Each stool sample is carefully placed and catalogued in a collection tube. Slide activated Seiler, DeBeauchamp-Newman and McKenzie spread out on the beach, kneeling or squatting while collecting stool samples. Slide activated The scientists cap tubes and place the collected and catalogued samples into cardboard freezer boxes with 81 spaces for tubes per box. These boxes will later be placed on ice. Slide activated The scientists head to multiple beaches throughout the week, which are closed during the shorebird migration period. McKenzie walks past a sign warning the beach is closed, as the research group has special permission to be here. Slide activated DeBeauchamp-Newman and McKenzie watch a large group of horseshoe crabs on a beach just out of the water as the tide goes out. Slide activated DeBeauchamp-Newman and McKenzie watch a group of shorebirds take off from a pier on the beach while collecting samples. Slide activated The scientists finish collecting samples on this beach before the tide returns, then reiterate the process several times throughout the week until they have over 1,000 samples. Slide activated Lisa Kercher, PhD, St. Jude Department of Infectious Disease, packs the boxes full of sample tubes on ice packs in an insulating container. At the end of the week, the scientists will drive these samples back to St. Jude for processing and analysis. Ripple effects from the past The trip began decades ago, when Robert G. Webster, PhD, emeritus faculty of the St. Jude Department of Infectious Diseases, discovered the source for all influenza (affecting humans and other animals) was in wild birds. As birds are the natural host of influenza, he planned an annual St. Jude trip to collect samples. Webster needed to identify a place with a high concentration of these animals to ensure flu would be present. He found it in Delaware Bay. “Delaware Bay is quite a unique environment,” said Richard J Webby, PhD, St. Jude Department of Infectious Diseases, who has continued leading influenza work at the institution since Webster’s retirement. “These shorebirds don’t have a lot of flu in other places around the world, but the ones at Delaware Bay do. It clearly has something to do with the sheer number of birds that go there, the fact they’ve been flying for a long time already, increasing their susceptibility and then spending a long period there that allows viruses to spread quickly.” Importantly, these bird populations appear to be asymptomatic carriers of the virus, even though they may be infected with a strain known to be dangerous in other types of birds. This resiliency, along with the predictability of their mass migration, make them a near-perfect source of samples to determine what is happening with flu in birds — and provide ever-important context about how the viruses have changed over time and what that might mean for future pandemics, whether in birds or humans. In order to predict what might happen in the future, researchers need to be able to look back at the big picture — data collected over time — to extrapolate trends and anticipate what to expect in the years ahead. “The collection’s real strength is setting the baseline for influenza research,” said Webby. “It’s provided an understanding of what normal looks like. Now we have a much better chance of knowing what abnormal is like when it happens.” Setting the baseline in influenza research The data collected in Delaware Bay is one of the only long-term datasets on avian influenza. This data allows researchers to see patterns and identify when something unexpected occurs. The work also generated reagents and resources useful for investigating human influenza. In some ways, having the baseline data from influenza in its bird reservoir may help diminish bias from human influenza virus collection. Most human influenza virus samples are collected from sick individuals — specifically, those showing symptoms. Investigators rarely sample asymptomatic infections, biasing the study of human viruses toward those that cause disease, which may miss details of how the virus functions and adapts in asymptomatic individuals. The unbiased collection of the bird influenza viruses allows researchers to see a fuller picture of how influenza lives and evolves. And, of course, that can inform understanding of what makes a pathogenic virus differ from their innocuous cousins. In turn, researchers can use that knowledge to understand, prevent and end epidemics and pandemics. “One thing we hope to learn from these trips is: What influences outbreak size from one year to the next? Even in humans, we don’t know that,” said Webby. “And why do we have some big and some milder flu seasons? It’s clearly a property of the viruses and, certainly, the host. Those are the types of questions we can ask with longitudinal data like this.” Tracking the effect of climate Though this line of research promises to answer difficult questions about influenza, it is also sensitive to environmental disruptions. Even high-quality field research cannot evade the wrath of climate. In 2012, Hurricane Sandy hit the East Coast of the U.S., far north of the typical hurricane range, causing unprecedented damage in the area, including the beach ecosystems. These disruptions, in turn, have altered viral ecology. “We used to find quite a cyclical pattern where there was a high prevalence of flu one year, followed by one of lower, higher, lower, higher,” said Webby. “It’s changed over the last few years since Hurricane Sandy.” The impact of commercial fishing on the declining horseshoe crab population should also not be underestimated. If the team had not already been in place, monitoring the flu over time, they might not have realized the influenza prevalence baseline had shifted due to the extreme weather. In addition, Hurricane Sandy and commercial fishing showed that external events could indirectly affect avian flu spread. The long-term view of the work provides a unique perspective for such events. Consistent field science, across time and new technologies When Webster started the trip, it was the first of its kind for avian influenza. Some members of the St. Jude team have been going for decades. Technology has advanced throughout that time, allowing more sample characterization and increasing the richness of the already-vast longitudinal data set. But the same basic premise, collecting samples from this uniquely infected bird population, requires an enormous amount of fieldwork. “Early on, there was a lot of pooling of samples because it was a little smaller program,” Webby explained. “They would isolate viruses and then characterized them serologically into subtypes. Now we don’t do that. As sequencing capacity has increased so drastically, we now focus on sequencing the viruses.” Instead of pooling, the researchers meticulously collect and track over 1,000 individual samples to prepare for sequencing. To collect the hundreds of samples needed in the few hours before the tide comes in, they have developed techniques to obtain over 200 samples a day efficiently. From assessing the most promising beaches to holding multiple tubes in their hands, every part of the process is planned in advance. After returning from the beach, the group returns samples to St. Jude for testing via two methods. One set of samples is placed on ice and driven back to Memphis, Tennessee, by one of the researchers, who maintains temperature control and proper safety protocols throughout the journey. The other is returned via FedEx, following strict safety protocols for potentially biohazardous materials. Once they arrive, they are sequenced and cataloged, and their information is added to an already vast dataset, leading to new experiments and insights. “The trip and the samples collected have provided us with a lot of viruses with some unique properties to study,” said Webby. “But most importantly, it’s given us a lot of background baseline data on what these viruses are like in their natural reservoir.” Small viruses, big world A viral pandemic can feel like a fire that slowly, then rapidly, engulfs the globe. As the ongoing avian influenza pandemic has shown, what happens in wild birds has implications for domestic birds and even humans (although the current threat of bird-to-human flu transmission is low). Understanding these viruses and preparing for the next pandemic is only possible with reliable data. By returning to Delaware Bay every year, the St. Jude team has built an invaluable treasure trove of data. Webby’s group will continue working with the viruses throughout the year. The trip has produced multiple scientific discoveries, including understanding how birds spread influenza across the globe, recognizing how Delaware Bay is a “hot spot” for virus-host interactions and how virus-host interactions happen in birds to keep infections mostly asymptomatic. Next year, when the crab egg-laying season comes again, the birds will return, and the cycle will start again — with many of the same researchers back on the beach, collecting samples from the grains of sand that allow St. Jude scientists to better understand the world of influenza virus.

CSL Seqirus, a business unit of CSL, recently celebrated the construction milestone known as “topping out,” which marks the completion of the highest point in a building’s construction. The project makes an important contribution to both public health and economic growth, said Jonah Smith, Vice President and Program Lead for CSL Seqirus Tullamarine. The site will aid global preparedness for seasonal and pandemic influenza. “This will be the only cell-based influenza vaccine manufacturing facility in the Southern Hemisphere, and we’ve designed it to support a sustainable future for our community,” Smith told the media at the recent topping out ceremony. “We’re incorporating on-site renewable energy generation, electrifying the plant to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, conducting heat and water recovery. This is also one of the first local manufacturing facilities to pursue 5 star ‘Green Star’ and Gold WELL certification.” Upon completion, the site in Tullamarine, Melbourne, will welcome CSL employees into its 305,695 square feet (28,400 square meters) office and manufacturing space to support the production of influenza vaccines for Australia and other markets. CSL invested more than $800 million AUD (US $534 million) into the Tullamarine hub and the supply chain is worth more than $300 million AUD annually to the Australian economy. In addition to vaccines, the facility will produce antivenoms used to treat dangerous bites and sings. It’s another way the new site will contribute to the health of Australia and its neighbors, said Dr. Jonathan Anderson, CSL Seqirus Executive Medical Director, International Regions. “We have been producing antivenoms since the development of tiger snake antivenom in 1930 and through this facility we will continue to help protect people in the event of a venomous bite or sting from snakes, spiders and marine creatures native to our region,” he said. The site, on track to become operational in 2026, is part of the company’s $2 billion investment in Australia. Other recent projects include the new plasma fractionation facility in Broadmeadows and new global headquarters in Melbourne. Learn more about the Tullamarine facility.

What is SARS-CoV-2? Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus that first appeared in Wuhan, China in 2019. SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain of coronavirus that had not been identified in humans before. 2, What is COVID-19? Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. 3. Where do coronaviruses come from? Coronaviruses can infect and circulate among different animal species, such as pigs, cats or dogs. Some groups of coronaviruses also circulate among humans and cause seasonal epidemics, mostly during the winter months. Coronaviruses that circulate among humans are thought to originate from animal reservoirs. Bats are also considered natural hosts of these viruses and have been the source of coronaviruses that have transmitted to humans and caused severe disease. Sometimes this happens through an intermediate host. For example, the first severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) originated in bats and was transmitted to humans via civet cats, causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans in 2003. About 30% of people who get SARS die; however, no human cases have been reported since 2004. Similarly, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) can transmit from camels to humans, causing MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome). The first transmission was observed in 2012 and human infections are mostly limited to the Arabian Peninsula. The precise way in which SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted from animals to humans is currently unknown. Factsheet for health professionals on COVID-19 4. Is SARS-CoV-2 comparable with SARS or with the seasonal flu? The novel coronavirus detected in China in 2019, SARS-CoV-2, is closely related to the original SARS-CoV. These viruses cause respiratory diseases known as COVID-19 and SARS, respectively. Influenza, also known as the flu, is a respiratory illness that has similar symptoms but is caused by influenza viruses, not coronaviruses. SARS, the respiratory illness caused by the original SARS-CoV, emerged in late 2002 in China and caused more than 8 000 cases in 33 countries over the course of eight months. COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, emerged in late 2019 and spread very quickly across the globe. As SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, most people did not have immunity against it, so the entire human population was potentially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection at the start of the pandemic. Within the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 450 million cases were reported worldwide, with more than 100 million in the EU/EEA alone. Due to the nature of the disease, where some infected individuals may not have symptoms and not all individuals with symptoms will be tested, it is assumed that there are many undiagnosed cases. The likelihood of death from COVID-19 depends on vaccination status, age and the presence of certain underlying conditions. Older age is the strongest contributing factor. It is impossible to know when an influenza virus first infected humans, but convincing reports of influenza pandemics date back several hundred years. In a normal influenza year, about 1 in 1 000 people who develop seasonal flu die. The highest burden of disease for seasonal influenza is among children below the age of five years and in individuals older than 65 years of age. The viruses that cause COVID-19 and seasonal flu can spread between people who are in close contact with one another. Both are mainly spread by virus-containing particles that are expelled when infected people cough, sneeze or talk. The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to spread more easily than influenza and much more easily than SARS. Vaccines against COVID-19 have only recently become available, while influenza vaccines were developed as early as the 1930s. No vaccine is available for SARS. 5. How does SARS-CoV-2 spread? SARS-CoV-2 is mainly spread via virus-containing particles from an infected person who sneezes, coughs, speaks, sings or breathes in close proximity to other people. Virus-containing particles can be inhaled or deposited in the nose and mouth or on the eyes. More rarely, infection may be due to contact with surfaces contaminated with virus-infected particles. The virus can survive on some surfaces for a few hours (copper, cardboard) and on others for up to a number of days (plastic and stainless steel). However, the amount of viable virus declines over time and it is rarely present on surfaces in sufficient amounts to cause infection. Infection may occur when a person touches their nose, mouth or eyes with their hands if their hands have been contaminated by fluids containing the virus or by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus. An infected person can transmit the virus up to two days before they experience symptoms, as well as while they have symptoms. 6. When is a person infectious? SARS-CoV-2 can be detected one to three days before symptoms begin. However, detection of the virus does not necessarily mean that a person is infectious and able to spread the virus to others. Evidence indicates that people become infectious around 48 hours before symptoms start, but are most infectious when experiencing symptoms, even if the symptoms are mild and non-specific. Available data indicate that adults with mild to moderate COVID-19 remain infectious no longer than 10 days after symptoms begin. This estimate has been the same for variants of concern, such as Delta and Omicron. Most adults with severe to critical illness or severe immune suppression may remain infectious for up to 20 days after symptoms begin. Evidence shows that fully-vaccinated individuals who become sick with COVID-19 (referred to as ‘breakthrough infections’) can carry comparable amounts of virus as non-vaccinated people. 7. How severe is COVID-19 infection? Some people infected with SARS-CoV-2 will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and most will recover without requiring special treatment. COVID-19 can sometimes be a severe disease with respiratory insufficiency requiring intensive care and potentially leading to death. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Vaccinated individuals are less likely to have severe disease or to be hospitalised. The severity of COVID-19 also varies according to variant and pre-existing immunity, developed after vaccination or recovery from a prior infection.

Image: Dontana Keraskes/ Guam Daily Post/RNZ Pacific By Rachael Nath, RNZ Pacific journalist An influenza B outbreak has occurred at shelters housing residents who were hardest hit by Typhoon Mawar. It has been three weeks since typhoon Mawar wreaked havoc on Guam leaving hundreds displaced. Melissa Savares, mayor of Dededo, one of the worst hit areas, said some people were being kept apart from others. LISTEN TO RNZ PACIFIC WAVES: Post-typhoon Mawar nfluenza interview Other Typhoon Mawar reports “There have been confirmation that there are some individuals in the shelter that have influenza B, and they’ve actually been segregated or isolated,” she said. “Now, there’s no isolation rooms in the facility, but they’ve actually been isolated from the general crowd, meaning, they’ve been moved into like a side area of the gymnasium, where they’re not in immediate congregation, their beds, their pots, are not right up into a congregated space.” The Guam Daily Post reports that the Office of the Governor will step in and help relocate some residents at the shelters. 700 people in shelters It said a child was hospitalised on Tuesday following an influenza B outbreak at the Red Cross shelter at the Guam Pak Warehouse in Tamuning. More than 700 people reside in these two shelters, one of which Savares said did not provide proper ventilation. “In the one shelter that is in the warehouse, ventilation is very poor, in that area. However, the other one that’s in the gymnasium, there is ventilation,” she added. Last week, Savares said she felt the recovery had been “very slow” two weeks after Typhoon Mawar made landfall in the territory. She said for her village in the north of Guam, only about half of the community had water and electricity. This article is republished under a community partnership agreement with RNZ.

The understanding of how the human immune system interacts with pharmaceutical drugs is still limited, and epidemiological studies only start to emerge. As the metabolomics technology matures, both drug metabolites and biological responses can be measured in the same global profiling data. Therefore, a new opportunity presents itself to study the interactions between pharmaceutical drugs and immune system in the high-resolution mass spectrometry data. We report here a double-blinded pilot study of seasonal influenza vaccination, where half of the participants received daily metformin administration. Global metabolomics was measured in the plasma samples at six timepoints. Metformin signatures were successfully identified in the metabolomics data. Statistically significant metabolite features were found both for the vaccination effect and for the drug-vaccine interactions. This study demonstrates the concept of using metabolomics to investigate drug interaction with the immune response in human samples directly at molecular levels.

The dysfunction of immune system often underlies a large number of autoimmune, metabolic and inflammatory conditions1,7,8,9. The health burden is significantly greater in the ageing population10, which commonly live under pharmaceutical medications, and respond poorly to many vaccines11. It is clearly important to understand how pharmaceutical drugs interact with the immune system, but it is not an easy task given that human immunology is still a rapidly evolving science12,13. In recent years, much progress in human immunology was achieved via vaccine studies, as vaccines are an excellent tool to probe human immune system providing an opportunity to learn about immunological molecular perturbations over time from days to years14.Limited epidemiological studies have reported evidence of small molecular drugs impacting human immune responses, e.g., administration of statins has a minor detrimental but significant effect on influenza vaccination15,16,17. Using hospital records, Kidd et al. showed that a number of small molecular drugs influence the numbers of white blood cell subsets18. These hospital records are not easy to match to immunological studies, and they are not meant to be comprehensive. Furthermore, direct measurement of concentration of small molecular drugs and their metabolites, similar to the tests on professional athletes for prohibited drugs, is the most important information. Because it reflects the ongoing biological state and varying metabolic rate among individuals. In this regard, the advancement of mass spectrometry based metabolomics is potentially a game changer.Metabolomics is the global measurement of small molecules in a biological system, which includes biological metabolites, dietary intake, microbial contributions, environmental pollutants, and often pharmaceutical drugs19,20,21,22. Liu et al. recently showed successful identification of nicotine (tobacco), naphthol sulfate (industrial chemical), omeprazole (medication) and piperine (food) and their derivatives in routine metabolomics analysis of human samples23. With both the environmental factors and biological responses in the same data, a new paradigm of gene-metabolome-environment interaction is emerging24,25. Thus, in a controlled study of vaccine induced immune responses, metabolomics offers the opportunity to examine both the drug response and vaccine response, and test for potential interactions.The application of metabolomics to vaccinology is still in a nascent stage. Previous metabolomic analyses showed that systemic metabolites were perturbed by seasonal influenza vaccine26 and by herpes zoster vaccine27, with broad interactions with cellular and gene programs. A significant observation in the integrative analysis of human transcriptome and metabolome in Li et al. (2017)27 was that baseline SREBF1 (Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1) activity was associated with B cell responses to vaccination, and the finding was recently confirmed in a detailed mouse study28.Here, we have conducted a pilot study of seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) in older adults, where half of the participants received metformin, a common drug for controlling diabetes, for a total of 20 weeks. The study was double-blinded and placebo-controlled, enrolling nondiabeticonprediabetic men and women over the age of 65 years. Ultrahigh-resolution metabolomics was performed on the plasma samples from 15 participants over six timepoints. The study was motivated by the effects of metformin in improving mitochondrial functions, reducing chronic pro-inflammatory signaling29, and targeting multiple hallmarks of aging30. Given the prominent role of metformin in aging studies and its geroprotective potential at molecular level31, it becomes an important question if metformin enhances the immune responses to vaccines. Research in this direction is urgent because better vaccine efficacy is needed for the older population and how to optimize their immunity has broad health impacts. In this report, we focus on how the metabolomics data manifest the biological responses to metformin, IIV vaccine and their interaction.ResultsFifteen volunteers were recruited at the University of Connecticut Health Center, and randomly double-blinded assigned into two groups for either placebo (n = 7) or metformin (n = 8) treatment. The cohort was between 67 to 89 years old, with 8 males and 7 females and no significant differences in basic characteristics at baseline (placebo: 74.71 ± 2.45 years old, 3 males, BMI: 27.31 ± 1.68; metformin: 74.13 ± 2.42 years old, 5 males, BMI: 26.43 ± 1.47). The metformin group received Metformin Hydrochloride Extended-Release, 1500 mg/day (three 500 mg ER tablets once a day, starting at 500 mg ER/day and progressed per current recommendations). High dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (Fluzone, Sanofi Pasteur Inc) was administered via intramuscular injection to all participants at approximately day 70 (Fig. 1).Fig. 1: A double blinded clinical study of metformin in influenza vaccination in the elderly.A total of 15 study participants over the age of 65 years were randomly assigned to metformin or placebo treatment for 20 weeks. All participants were vaccinated with high-dose trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine after 10 weeks of treatment of metformin or placebo. Blood samples were collected over six timepoints, on days 0, 35, 70, 77, 105 and 140 approximately. Metformin administration started on day 0, and vaccine was administered on day 70. Our statistical analysis used two models to focus on the metformin effect (Model 1 using first three timepoints), and on the vaccine effect and interaction (Model 2 using two timepoints before and after vaccination).Full size imageThe antibody and T cell responses in this cohort are published elsewhere32. Briefly, similar increase of antibody titers was observed post vaccination in both the metformin and control groups. Decreased CD57 expression was observed in CD4 T cells but not in CD8 T cells. Overall, the immunological data showed some trending improvements with metformin for flu vaccine responses, including circulating T follicular helper cells, but the cohort was underpowered for full conclusions. However, the adaptive responses are only part of our highly complex immune system. Therefore, in order to gain in-depth molecular insights, we analyzed the metabolomic profiles in this cohort.Untargeted metabolomics measured metformin and its abundance in the plasma of study participantsThe plasma samples collected from the participants were analyzed by ultrahigh-resolution metabolomics. We applied four untargeted LC-MS (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) methods to increase the coverage of assays: hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) with positive electrospray ionization (ESI + ) and with negative electrospray ionization (ESI-), reversed phase (RP) chromatography with ESI+ and ESI−. The numbers of metabolite features in each method are reported in Table 1, after filtering of background peaks and by signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).Table 1 Summary of significant metabolite features in statistical models.Full size tableAs a first step, the global metabolomics data enabled us to investigate the metabolic impact by metformin administration. This was analyzed by the time course in the metformin treated participants, using the three timepoints prior to vaccination (days 0, 35 and 70 as depicted in Fig. 1). Since metabolomics not only measures biological metabolites but small molecules in general, it is not surprising to find metformin itself in the metabolomics data. Indeed, the most significant two features were metformin and its 13C isotopologue (Fig. 2a). The isotopologue was from the naturally occurring stable 13C carbon atoms and eluted at the same time as the more abundant 12C form in chromatography. The LC-MS spectra of metformin and its identification via MS/MS are shown in Fig. 2b. The feature intensity values (peak area in LC-MS) in metabolomics are a proxy of the concentration in biological samples. With metformin identified, its abundance in the study participants was plotted in Fig. 2c, where the metformin group show a persistent level of metformin through the course of this study and the placebo group have no detected level. Individual variation is also seen in Fig. 2c, which reflects the heterogenicity of human populations, including the different metabolic rates among individuals. It cannot be ruled out that individuals might have different compliance to the study regimen. These data prove that valuable pharmacological information can be directly obtained from metabolomics without clinical records.Fig. 2: Identification of metformin and measured kinetics in study cohort.a Metabolite features that are different between the metformin group and placebo group, analyzed using Model 1, a mixed effect model where visit was modeled as fixed effect and participants were modeled as random effect. Significance is shown as -log10(adjusted p-value) on Y-axis. The two most significant features correspond to metformin and its 13C isotopologue. Features with false discovery rate (FDR) under 0.05 are colored in red. b Metformin is identified by accurate mass and fragmentation in MS/MS. Reference MS/MS spectrum of metformin is from MassBank (id: EA255011; red color), precursor ion m/z 130.1089. c Kinetics of metformin in all study participants. No metformin is detected in the placebo group (red). Each participant in the metformin group is plotted in light blue, and their mean values are in dark blue. All data in this figure are based on ESI+ mass spectrometry coupled with a HILIC column.Full size imageMetformin induced broad metabolomic changes, including fatty acid biosynthesisThe metabolomic analysis of participants after metformin administration revealed a number of significantly altered features (58 in HILIC ESI+ in Fig. 2a; 179 in HILIC ESI−, 83 in RP ESI+, 176 in RP ESI−, Table 1), with a stringent threshold of false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 and fold change >1.5. The group average of the HILIC ESI+ features is shown in Fig. 3a as a heatmap. Among them, 37 metabolite features were increased and 21 decreased consistently in post metformin visits. Examples of individual metabolites from Fig. 3a are shown as box and whisker plots in Fig. 3b. These include urea cycle metabolites citruline and N-acetyl arginine, and bile acids, such as glycochenodeoxycholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid. Significant pathways impacted by metformin are summarized in Fig. 3c. Several metabolites in de novo fatty acid biosynthesis showed consistent decrease in plasma post metformin treatment (e.g. linolenic acid in Fig. 3b). Decrease of N-acetyl arginine, citrulline and several short-chain and long-chain carnitines (Supplementary Fig. S1) is similar to the observations made by previous metabolomic studies of metformin33,34.Fig. 3: Metabolomic response to metformin in study cohort.a Metabolite features significantly different after metformin administration in the plasma samples of participants. Heatmap shows group mean values, for 58 features with FDR < 0.05 and absolute fold change response >1.5 in both post-metformin visits (i.e. day 70 and day 77). b Selected significant features, all significant as in (a) but also marked by paired t-test p-values (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01). The annotation of 2-hydroxypyridine sulfate was based on MS1 and MS2 spectra matches (level 2). The other metabolites were identified with authentic standards (level 1). All of the box plots show the median (center line), first and third quantiles (box limits), and max 1.5 × interquartile range (IQR) from box limits in each direction (upper and lower whiskers). c Pathway enrichment of top metabolite features using mummichog software (across all modes). Only top ten pathways enriched at p < 0.05 and >3 overlapping empirical compounds are shown.Full size imageMetabolomic impacts by the seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccineTo analyze the effect of IIV vaccine administration, we focused on the two timepoints before and after vaccination (days 70 and 77 as depicted in Fig. 1), as IIV induces a recall immune response that peaks around one week after vaccination35. The day 70 served as vaccination baseline. This was fitted to a mixed effect statistical model with metformin status as a covariate and considering metformin and vaccine interaction (Model 2, described in Methods). With FDR < 0.05 and fold change >1.5, the numbers of significant features are shown in Table 1 for all four LC-MS methods. Of note, Model 2 identified fewer significant features associated with metformin response, because the data points here are cross-sectional comparison with the placebo group, while Model 1 was able to use three time points before vaccination that were matched to the same individuals.The significant metabolite features associated with vaccine response in the HILIC ESI+ data are shown in Fig. 4a. One of those is glyceric acid (Fig. 4b), a common intermediate of multiple pathways, especially in energy metabolism. It was previously reported to be elevated in autoimmune diseases36,37. It’s increase here correlates with the timing of major expansion of antibody secreting cells. Energy metabolism, such as fructose and mannose metabolism and TCA cycle, is indeed enriched in our pathway analysis (Fig. 4c). Pathway analysis also revealed multiple pathways on inflammatory lipid mediators in response to IIV, including leukotriene, arachidonic acids and glycosphingolipids (Fig. 4c). The remaining metabolites in Fig. 4b have a lower-confidence annotation, which may get updated when further information is obtained on these compounds. But they have relatively high abundance in these plasma samples, and their LC-MS peaks are easily verifiable (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, our data indicate that they are true chemical compounds that were elevated after vaccination. Using the same statistical criteria, no significant metabolite was found at days 105 and 140 in comparison to day 70. This was not surprising because most immunological events after IIV occur within the first two weeks26,38,39,40,41.Fig. 4: Metabolomic response to seasonal influenza vaccine in study cohort.a Metabolite features different after IIV vaccination in the plasma samples of participants, shown in volcano plot with significance on Y-axis and magnitude on X-axis. Significant metabolite features were determined by Model 2 (FDR < 0.05 and absolute fold change response >1.5). b Selected significant features, all significant as in (a) but also marked by paired t-test p-values (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01). Glyceric acid was identified with MSI level 1 annotation and others (1-Methylinosine [283.1037@103.62], Thymidine glycol [275.0833@110.96], Bissulfine [117.0041@45.67]) with MSI level 4 annotation. All of the box plots show the median (center line), first and third quantiles (box limits), and max 1.5 × interquartile range (IQR) from box limits in each direction (upper and lower whiskers). c Pathway enrichment of top metabolite features using mummichog software (across all modes). Only top ten pathways enriched at p < 0.05 and >3 overlapping compounds are shown.Full size imageStatistically significant interaction between metformin and IIV was found in metabolomic featuresThe above analyses showed that specific metabolic features were impacted by the drug metformin or by the IIV vaccine. To understand if a drug has a positive or negative effect on the vaccination, it is important to know if metabolites are impacted by both. This global metabolomics dataset provides the opportunity to test the statistical interaction between metformin and IIV. This was included as an interaction term in our Model 2. Among four LC-MS methods, 2 in HILIC ESI+ and 1 feature in RP ESI− were found to be significant, using a stringent FDR < 0.05 (Table 1). As shown in Fig. 5, the vaccine responses of these three features are clearly different between the metformin and placebo groups. The m/z values of these features match to a large number of compounds in metabolite databases. The feature 512.1714@164.48 (ESI−) also showed a proper isotopologue pattern. Unfortunately, we failed to identify these three metabolites, but believe they are real compounds because they all passed our filter of background peaks and SNR, and their LC-MS peaks are distinct (Supplementary Fig. S3). Metabolite identification is a common challenge in metabolomics today. Alternatively, functional insight of an unknown metabolite can be gained from metabolome-wide association studies (MWAS)42,43.Fig. 5: Metabolite features found with significant statistical interaction between metformin and vaccine.a Metabolites with FDR < 0.05 in Model 2 show different responses to vaccination based on the metformin treatment. Their m/z@retention time is shown on top. All of the box plots show the median (center line), first and third quantiles (box limits), and max 1.5 × interquartile range (IQR) from box limits in each direction (upper and lower whiskers). b Metabolite features associated with [147.0847@65.03] in this study, HILIC ESI+ data. c The metabolite features associated with [147.0843@354.85] in the Broad dataset. The p-value on Y-axis in (b, c) is based on Spearman rank correlation. FDR values are in similar range. d Retention times between the two studies are comparable after realignment, based on common known metabolites in both datasets. Both are HILIC ESI+ data. e Pathway enrichment of metabolites significantly associated with the 147.0843 features in both datasets, as in (b) and (c). All pathways with p < 0.01 are shown.Full size imageThe MWAS profile of the feature 147.0847@65.03 is shown in Fig. 5b, showing strikingly significant associations to a cluster of compounds that are eluted at 161 s. To validate this in an independent cohort, we retrieved a large dataset of 1172 samples that were analyzed using a similar platform at Broad Institute (Orbitrap mass spectrometer with HILIC ESI+,44). Our feature 147.0847@65.03 was matched to 147.0843@354.85 in the Broad study, which has a highly significant association pattern to a cluster of compounds at 556 s (Fig. 5c). Between the two studies, the liquid chromatography had different length, but the retention times were comparable after realignment using known compounds (Fig. 5d). The trendline in Fig. 5d indicates that 65 and 161 s in our study are matched to 354 and 555 s in the Broad study. Therefore, these results indicate that the MWAS pattern of 147.0847@65.03 in our study is reproduced in the Broad data. Indeed, the cluster at 161 s in Fig. 5b and the cluster at 555 s in Fig. 5c share at least five same m/z values. Both clusters, however, have few matches in HMDB, suggesting that the compounds are probably part of the exposome; the feature at 147.0847 is likely to be part of their biological response. These two clusters do not contribute to pathway enrichment tests statistically, because they do not match to known pathways. Yet, the pathway patterns underlying the two overall MWAS results share the same top two pathways (Fig. 5e). Taken together, our feature 147.0847@65.03 showed significant association with urea cycle and aspartate and asparagine metabolism (Fig. 5e); it correlates intriguingly but reproducibly with a group of unknown compounds that warrant future investigation. The other feature 160.0801@23.09 eluted too early to be found in the Broad data (while other major peaks of this m/z match perfectly between two studies).DiscussionThe metabolic responses to metformin here are consistent with previous reports. The glucose lowering potential of metformin has been largely attributed to its ability to suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis through both AMPK dependent and independent pathways (reviewed in45). Interest are also growing in its anti-aging, anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative roles46,47,48,49,50,51. Metformin reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibits NF-κB signaling29,52,53, both contributing to increased basal inflammation with aging. Overall, metformin regulates several aspects of nutrient sensing and energy homeostasis in various metabolically active organs leading to improved blood glucose and lipid profiles54,55. Our data revealed that several lipids and amino acids related pathways were altered by metformin administration. De novo fatty acid biosynthesis was the most significantly altered pathway (Fig. 3b) upon metformin administration in our data. AMPK is one of the key targets of metformin under pharmacological concentrations in liver and have been reported for its role in improved blood glucose and lipid profiles56,57. AMPK is also a master regulator of whole-body energy homeostasis and maintains the balance between nutrients supply and energy demand. Liver mediated AMPK phosphorylation of SREBP1 (master regulator of lipogenesis) and ACC1/2 (a rate-limiting enzyme for fatty acid synthesis) inhibits hepatic de-novo lipogenesis45,58,59,60. Moreover, ACC1/2 phosphorylation leads to a decreased production of malonyl-CoA (which is an inhibitor of mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1)) and subsequent enhanced hepatic fatty acid oxidation45. Our results showed a decrease of abundance in several metabolites in pathways responsible for synthesis of lipids and their derivatives including de novo fatty acid biosynthesis pathway, arachadonic acid metabolism, glycerophosopholipid metabolism and prostaglandin formation from arachidonate. These results are in line with the previous reports where many lipids and lipid derivatives including poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), eiconsaids, glycerophospholipds were observed to show decreased plasma abundance upon metformin administration in healthy volunteers33,34, and alterations in de-novo fatty acids synthesis and inflammatory lipid derivatives in different pathological conditions61,62,63,64,65,66.Metformin has been reported to alter the composition of gut microbiota67,68,69, which is expected to change the profile of metabolites of microbial origin. Dahabiyeh et al. showed two microbial metabolites following a similar abundance pattern to metformin administration in healthy volunteers34. Our data revealed an increased trend of the plasma metabolites related to bile acids over post metformin visits (Fig. 3c). This is consistent with the report by Hao et al. on an overall increase of plsama bile acids (total, primary, secondary, and unconjugated), along with altered microbiota composition in metformin administered treatment-naïve recently diagnosed diabetic partcipants67.So far, metabolomics has been applied to only few vaccine studies26,27,39,70. Thus, the current knowledge of vaccine induced responses was mainly learnt from serological, cellular and transcriptional data27,38,71,72. Previous studies of seasonal influenza vaccination in humans revealed common gene signatures of type 1 interferons (between days 1–3) and plasma cells (between days 7–11) corresponding to the induction of innate and adaptive responses, respectively. Many of these studies have highlighted the age dependent differences in vaccine immunogenicity, and our cohort is considered as older adults. Our data revealed several perturbed pathways on carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism 1 week post vaccination. They are in line with previous studies where serine metabolism was shown to be associated with vaccine response38,39. Mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation processes were observed to be impacted by immune responses induced by influenza vaccine in ours and previous reports40,41.In this study, we have focused on day 7 after vaccination. In future opportunities, it will be informative to analyze more time points, including the early ones. The field of immunometabolomics is in its infancy, and it will take time to gain fuller understanding of the vaccine responses in terms of metabolic phenotypes. More and more immunological and vaccine studies take a systems or holistic approach, by collection high throughput multi-omics data, which shall contribute to useful insights on how small molecules, biological or abiological, interact with the immune system. Advantages of metabolomics also include that it’s easy to use biobanked materials, and that it can become very economical in the near future.We reported the annotation confidence according to the MSI standards73. Metabolite identification, however, is still challenging in metabolomics, especially for low-abundance or less common metabolites. This is similar to the early days of genomics, when genes were deposited as unknown sequence but annotation improved over time. The ultrahigh mass resolution of our data also means that people can reuse the data from public repository, and the unknown metabolites, like unknown genes, can gain annotation in the future. This is already demonstrated in our reuse of the Broad dataset44: the MWAS of our feature 147.0847@65.03, significant in the interaction between IIV and metformin, is reproduced in the larger study in Fig. 5.This pilot study was designed to test the interaction between metformin and IIV in a small cohort. Nonetheless, with highly stringent statistical analysis, ultrahigh-resolution metabolomics prove to be powerful to identify (i) metformin and its metabolic signatures in untargeted metabolomics data, (ii) significant metabolic responses to IIV, and (iii) significant metabolites as a result of the interaction between metformin and vaccination. The proof-of-principle is important, demonstrating the feasibility of studying the interaction of drugs and immune responses in human populations.MethodsClinical study designThis pilot study is a double-blinded placebo-controlled trial in men and women over the age of 65 years. Subjects were screened rigorously for eligibility. Study exclusion criteria included the following: any unstable medical conditions or severe co-morbidities (severe COPD, severe congestive heart failure, advanced neurological disorders, etc), contraindications for metformin (severe renal or liver impairment), contraindication for flu vaccine (history of Guillain-Barre syndrome post vaccination or allergic to component of vaccine), immunosuppressive disorders, immunosuppressive medications, and active cancer. Importantly, participants were excluded if they were prediabetic or diabetic (HbA1c ≥ 5.7%) to avoid any confounding impact of metformin on diabetes status. Eligible participants were randomized to metformin (final dose 1500 mg extended release (ER)/day) or placebo treatment. To limit gastrointestinal issues per current metformin label recommendations, participants started with 1 tablet a day for week 1 (500 mg metformin ER/day or placebo), then 2 tablets a day for week 2 (1000 mg metformin ER or placebo), and finally 3 tablets a day for week 3 until the completion of the study (1500 mg metformin ER or placebo). Fifteen subjects (n = 8 metformin, n = 7 placebo) were randomized and completed the study on treatment with no differences in basic characteristics at baseline (placebo: 74.71 ± 2.45 years old, 3 males, BMI: 27.31 ± 1.68; metformin: 74.13 ± 2.42 years old, 5 males, BMI: 26.43 ± 1.47).All participants were vaccinated with Fluzone high-dose trivalent flu vaccine (Sanofi Pasteur Inc., Swiftwater, PA) after ~70 days of treatment. Blood was drawn via standard venipuncture into EDTA-treated vacutainers prior to treatment (Day 0), prior to vaccination (~day 35 and ~day 70), and 7, ~35, and ~70 days post vaccination. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Connecticut Health Center (UCHC) and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03996538). All study participants provided written informed consent to participate in the study.Plasma sample collection and preparationEDTA-treated whole blood was immediately centrifuged and the resultant plasma was stored at −80 °C until analyses. Plasma metabolites extraction was carried out by protein precipitation technique using extraction solvent, acetonitrile:methanol (8:1, v/v) containing 0.1% formic acid and isotope labelled [Trimethyl-13C3]-caffeine, [13C5]-L-glutamic acid, [15 N2]-Uracil, [15 N,13C5]-L-methionine, [13C6]-D-glucose and [15N]-L-tyrosine as spike-in controls. 30 μl of plasma was taken and 60 μl of extraction solvent was added. Extraction blanks were also prepared to remove features of non-biological origins. All samples were vortexed and incubated with shaking at 1000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min at 20,817 × g. The supernatant was transferred into mass spec vials and 2 μl injected into UHPLC-MS.LC-MS metabolomics and LC-MS/MS analysisThe chromatographic separations were performed using Thermo ScientificTM TranscendTM Duo LX-2 UHPLC system interfaced with high resolution Thermo ScientificTM Orbitrap ID-XTM TribidTM mass spectrometer with a HESI ionization source, using positive and negative ionization modes. All samples were maintained at 4 °C in the autosampler. Data were acquired using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and reversed phase (RP) column in parallel both in positive and negative polarities in full scan mode with mass resolution of 120,000. An AccucoreTM−150-Amide HILIC column (2.6 μm, 2.1 mm × 50 mm) and a Hypersil GOLDTM RP column (3 μm, 2.1 mm × 50 mm) maintained at 45 °C were used for chromatographic separation. 10 mM ammonium acetate in acetonitrile:water (95:5, v/v) with 0.1% acetic acid as mobile phase A and 10 mM ammonium acetate in acetonitrile:water (50:50, v/v) with 0.1% acetic acid as mobile phase B were used for HILIC method. 0.1% formic acid in water and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile were used as mobile phase A and B respectively for RP acquisition. For HILIC acquisition, following gradient was applied at a flow rate of 0.55 ml/min: 0–0.1 min: 0% B, 0.10–5.0 min: 98% B, and 5 min for cleaning and equilibration of column. For RP column, following gradient was applied at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min: 0–0.1 min: 0% B, 0.10–1.9 min: 60% B, 1.9–5.0 min: 98% B, and 5 min cleaning and column equilibration. This way the mass spec data for each sample was collected consecutively, carrying only one (either HILIC or RP) eluent to the MS for 5 min, while the other eluent was directed to the waste during washing and re-equilibration.Mass spectrometry data were collected with the following MS settings: mass range, 80–1000 m/z; spray voltage, 3500 V (ESI + ), 2800 V (ESI−); sheath gas, 45 Arb; auxiliary gas, 20 Arb; sweep gas, 1 Arb; ion transfer tube temperature, 325 °C; vaporizer temperature, 325 °C; full scan mass resolution, 120,000 (MS1); normalized AGC target (%), 25; maximum injection time, 100 ms. Data dependent fragmentation (dd-MS/MS) parameters for each polarity as follows: isolation window (m/z), 1.2; stepped HCD collision energy (%), 20,40,80; dd-MS/MS resolution, 30,000; normalized AGC target (%), 20; maximum injection time (ms), 54; microscan, 1; cycle time (sec), 1.2. A full scan data-dependent MS2 (ddMS2) method was utilized to collect MS2 spectra for identification of compounds.Metabolomics data processingAll samples were analyzed in a single batch after randomization. Raw LC-MS data was converted to mzML format using ThermoRawFileParser74. Asari (version 1.9.2), an open source Python software was used for m/z and retention time (rt) alignment, peak detection, feature quantification, and empirical compound based putative identification (level 4 annotation using HMDB)75 using the default parameters. Level 1 annotation of compounds were obtained by matching retention times and accurate masses from in-house authentic compound libraries. Level 2 annotation of compounds were obtained by matching acquired MS2 spectra of accurate precursor masses from pooled plasma sample against public spectral databases (MassBank, MoNA)73,76 using R package Spectra with >=0.7 cosine similarity score. Matching of MS1 features with precursor ion’s accurate masses and retention times was performed using within 10 ppm tolerance and 10 s, respectively. All the metabolite annotation levels adhere to Metabolomics Standard Initiative (MSI) guidelines73.Features were filtered using two criteria. First, the features with three times greater intensity in biological samples than in blanks samples were retained. Second, the features with signal to noise ratio (SNR) greater than 100 were retained (noise in asari is defined by the mean of all non-peak data points in an extracted ion chromatogram). Two different quality control samples (a commercial pooled plasma sample and pooled study samples) were used to verify the chromatography and signal reproducibility. Visual inspection of outliers through PCA plots and Total ion count (TIC) was conducted. Data were log2 transformed and mean normalized using top ten percent of high abundance features. Features below detection limit were imputed using half of the minimum intensity value. After QC filtering, 5987, 4245, 3284, 8546 features were retained for downstream data analysis, in each HILIC ESI+, HILIC ESI−, RP ESI+ and RP ESI− modes respectively.Statistical analysisWe constructed two linear mixed effect models using the lme477 package in R to assess the metformin response on plasma metabolome, inactivated influenza vaccine response on plasma metabolome and the interaction responses of metformin and vaccine in concert on plasma metabolome.Model 1: For each metabolite feature, temporal variation due to metformin administration was assessed using linear mixed effects model:$${\rm{Metabolite\; Feature}}\, \sim \,{\rm{day}}+\,(1{\rm{|participant}})$$ (1) The variable ‘day‘ is a categorical variable that indicates discrete time points, including day 0, day 35, and day 70, where day 0 serves as the baseline for metformin administration and day 35 and day 70 represent time points after treatment with metformin. The term (1|participant) controls for repeated measurements on the same participant. The significance of timepoints was assessed with ANOVA and p-values were adjusted for multiple-testing based on Storey FDR method78,79.Model 2: In order to quantify the vaccine response and the interaction of metformin and vaccine, we constructed a mixed effect model utilizing a pre-vaccination time point (day 70, vaccination baseline) and a post-vaccination time point (day 77) as follows:$${\rm{Metabolite}}\; {\rm{Feature}} \sim {\rm{day}}+{\rm{metformin}}+\,{{\rm{day}}}^{* }{\rm{metformin}}+\,(1|{\rm{participant}})$$ (2) The ‘day‘ and ‘metformin‘ are used as proxy for vaccine treatment and drug treatment, respectively and modeled as fixed effects. We assessed the differentially abundant metabolite features between pre- (day 70) and post-vaccination (day 77) visits using the p value of coefficient term of the variable ‘day‘. The interaction term day*metformin was used to quantify statistically the response as a function of both vaccine and drug administration. The term (1|participant) controls for repeated measurements on the same participant. P values assessed using ANOVA were adjusted for multiple-testing based on Storey FDR method78,79.All the above statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.2.0. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using mummichog (version 2.6.1)80 using top metabolite features with p value < 0.05.Metabolome wide association analysisSpearman correlation was performed between the features of interest and the remaining features in the same dataset, generating p-values for MWAS. FDR was calculated using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. The sample number in this study was 90, in the Broad study 1172. The Broad dataset was retrieved from Metabolomics Workbench (accession number ST001237). The m/z and retention time of identified compounds in the Broad study were obtained from the authors. Known compounds from both studies were compared, then the uniquely matched compounds (same name and m/z within 5 ppm) were used for realigning the retention time.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

The researchers developed a unique set of metrics to quantify the level of immune resilience. This will aid in decisions for health care and help researchers understand differences in life span and health outcomes in persons of similar ages. These findings were published in Nature Communications. The study was supported by a MERIT award and other grants from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health; awards from the U.S. Veterans Health Administration; and a Distinguished Clinical Scientist Award from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. Not age-dependent Although age plays an important role in the body's response to infectious and other inflammatory stressors, some persons preserve and/or restore optimal immune resilience regardless of age, noted first and senior author Sunil K. Ahuja, MD, professor at UT Health Science Center San Antonio with a specialty in infectious diseases. He is director of the Veterans Administration (VA) Center for Personalized Medicine, a national center within the South Texas Veterans Health Care System. Immune resilience is the capacity to maintain good immune function, called immunocompetence, and minimize inflammation while experiencing inflammatory stressors. We found that during aging and when experiencing inflammatory stress, some persons resist degradation of immune resilience." Weijing He, MD, co-author and senior research scientist at the VA Center for Personalized Medicine and Foundation for Advancing Veterans' Health Research Results The laboratory tests developed to assess levels of immune resilience were evaluated in nearly 50,000 persons of differing ages and types of challenges to their immune systems. This evaluation demonstrated that individuals with optimal levels of immune resilience were more likely to: Live longer. Resist HIV and influenza infections. Resist AIDS. Resist recurrence of skin cancer after kidney transplant. Survive COVID-19 infection. Survive sepsis. The researchers measured immune resilience in two ways: By measuring the balance between CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells, which are types of white blood cells. T-cells fight infections, but an imbalance in their levels occurs in many infectious and autoimmune diseases. The balance between CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells, divided into four distinct categories called immune health grades, was measured in varied infection cohorts and across the age spectrum. By measuring the expression levels of genes linked with immunocompetence and a greater chance of survival versus those linked with inflammation and a higher risk of death. The gene expression markers signifying high immunocompetence and low inflammation were identified with the immune health grade tracking optimal immune resilience. "Many people think of inflammation alone when considering disease outcomes," explained co-author Grace C. Lee, PharmD, PhD, research investigator at the VA Center for Personalized Medicine and assistant professor at The University of Texas at Austin College of Pharmacy. "However, the concept of immune resilience captures levels of immunocompetence and inflammation together." 'A step forward' The study introduces the novel concept of immune resilience, which looks at the balance between immunocompetence and inflammation as a critical contributor to health outcomes, regardless of age. "This is an advantage and a step forward because by looking beyond inflammation, we may uncover new prevention and treatment strategies for chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, COVID-19, HIV/AIDS and cancers," Lee said. Framingham analysis Muthu Saravanan Manoharan, MS, coauthor and senior research scientist at the VA Center for Personalized Medicine and UT Health Science Center San Antonio, noted that the study team divided participants from the Framingham Heart Study into four groups based on the gene expression markers of immune resilience. "Participants with optimal immune resilience, defined by gene expression markers signifying high immunocompetence and low inflammation, lived longer after controlling for the effects of age and sex," Manoharan said. "Participants with metrics signifying low immunocompetence-high inflammation died sooner, whereas those with a combination of high immunocompetence-high inflammation, or low immunocompetence-low inflammation, had life spans that fell in between." Influenza The study team also examined gene expression markers of immune resilience in a population of healthy college students and individuals in the community, all under age 50, who had blood drawn before the influenza season started. On the day of the first symptoms, most participants, including those with optimal immune resilience before the flu-like illness, had gene expression profiles indicating low immunocompetence and high inflammation, which is noted in persons with shorter life spans. Many people restored their initial level of immune resilience during recovery; however, even some of those who had optimal immune resilience before influenza infection failed to do so. "Six months after their flu, some people continued to have gene expression signatures of poor immune health," noted Nathan Harper, MS, coauthor and senior biostatistician at the VA Center for Personalized Medicine and Foundation for Advancing Veterans' Health Research. "This is rather striking, because it means that inflammatory stressors like influenza can degrade a vulnerable person's immune health long term." Sex workers The study examined female sex workers from Kenya. During a long-term study, the immune health grades of those with unprotected sex decreased. "Most of the HIV acquisition occurred in women who had lower immune health grades," said Lyle R. McKinnon, PhD, coauthor and associate professor in the Max Rady College of Medicine, Department of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, at the University of Manitoba, Canada. "With guidance and tools for safe sex practices, women with a lower frequency of unprotected sex over a 10-year time frame had restored optimal immune resilience, suggesting that removal of an immunological stressor could lead to the restoration of a healthier immune status." HIV-AIDS In one of the cohorts, the authors observed a rare ability to maintain a high level of immunocompetence with a low level of inflammation despite chronic inflammatory stress, termed elite immune health status. "Interestingly, we found that some younger adults preserved optimal immune resilience markers despite HIV infection," said Jason F. Okulicz, MD, U.S. Air Force infectious disease physician and senior member of the study team. "The preservation of these markers associated with resistance to developing AIDS and a low level of HIV in the blood. Remarkably, we found that after starting antiviral therapy early, some HIV-positive persons manifested markers of optimal immune resilience typically observed in younger adults without HIV infection." COVID-19 The association between immune resilience and the response to infection was noted during other infections. About 80% of individuals had poor immune health grades at presentation with acute COVID-19, and their immune grade predicted mortality, regardless of age. "Even among patients with serious community-acquired pneumonia and sepsis, those who had higher levels of gene expression markers of immune resilience at admission to the intensive care unit were more likely to survive," noted coauthor Justin Meunier, BS, research scientist at the VA Center for Personalized Medicine. Kidney transplant recipients Immune resilience was also measured in kidney transplant recipients, who have a 100-fold excess risk of developing skin cancer. Each of the participants had developed this cancer once after transplant. "We explored the risk of getting a second cancer, dependent on immune health grades at the time each participant had the first cancer," said Matthew J. Bottomley, MD, DPhil, academic clinical lecturer in the Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences, University of Oxford. "We found that, if someone had optimal immune resilience at the time of the first cancer, they resisted getting their second cancer."

"We found that irrespective of age, persons with poor immune resilience had immune cell profiles reflecting increased immune activation," noted coauthor Edoardo Fiorillo, PhD, of the Institute for Genetic and Biomedical Research, National Council of Research, Lanusei, Italy. "Interestingly, we observed that nonhuman primates with poor immune resilience also manifested similar immune cell profiles." Females show greater immune resilience One consistent finding throughout the populations studied was that age was not the single determinant factor in a person's response to inflammatory stress. Some younger persons with poor immune resilience had the same signatures and immune health grades commonly seen in older persons. This finding suggests that the ability to restore and maintain immunocompetence at younger ages may be linked to life span. Another factor noted across the populations and species was that higher levels of optimal immune resilience were observed more often in females than males. Genetic studies in humans and evaluation of mice with a genetic basis to have lower immune resilience suggest that immune resilience may be calibrated by variations in genes. Notably, mice with lower immune resilience were most susceptible to severe Ebola infection. Understanding risks Public health ramifications of immune checkups could be significant, Ahuja said. He noted that assessment of immune health grades estimated by CD8+ and CD4+ counts is a simple way to monitor immune resilience. These assessments have utility for understanding who might be at greater risk for developing diseases that affect the immune system, how individuals are responding to treatment, and whether, as well as to what extent, they will recover.

Doctors bust some cold and flu mythsBy the Specialist Reporting Team's Alison BranleyTopic:InfluenzaWed 14 Jun 2023Wednesday 14 June 2023Wed 14 Jun 2023 at 7:47pmLike many young children, Renee's son Ned picks up different bugs from day care. (Supplied: Renee Fontana)abc.net.auews/snot-colour-not-a-measure-of-illness-infectiousness-for-flu-cold/102472080Link copiedShareShare articleWhen new mum Renee Fontana started her son Ned in childcare, she knew to expect regular illness, but was shocked by just how often her son got sick."This year we've missed every second week since April," she said.When little Ned isn't well enough to attend, Renee has to call her mother to care for him so she can go to work.But with so much sickness it's become a regular sight for Ned to have a runny nose or cough, even when he's not actually unwell anymore.Renee often feels unsure about when she can send Ned back to daycare.It's a conundrum faced by many parents in a post-COVID world that's more acutely aware of the signs of respiratory illness and the havoc it can wreak.One childcare centre was distributing this flyer, which contains outdated information. (Supplied)The ABC inspected policies and flyers given out by some childcare centres and found a mixture of advice, some of which was not evidence-based.One pointed to a document that suggested it was okay to send children if they had a sore throat or ear ache, which are often signs of viral illnesses.One suggested families look for a "runny, green nose" to check if their child was infectious (a myth we'll bust later).Another sent a "fact sheet" home that suggested the colour of snot could indicate their illness.Share your story with usPhoto shows Unidentified child's hands playing with building bricks.Are you struggling with the cost and availability of childcare? Tell us your story.So, when exactly do children, and adults, stop being contagious and when is it okay to return to work, school or childcare?We asked the experts to tackle this sticky subject.Does snot turn green when you're sick, and clear when you're well?No. This is an urban myth.Your snot can change colour for a range of reasons and not always in line with the progress of illness, says Allen Cheng, the the director of Infectious Diseases at Monash Health."The colour of your snot doesn't really mean much," he said."Often, viral infections give you a lot of snot and it's often clear."What's coming out of your child's nose isn't the best indicator of how sick they are. (Pexels: Elina Fairytale)It's also possible to have a clear runny nose at the start of an infection, which turns green or yellow, then becomes clear again towards the end.Margie Danchin, a consultant paediatrician at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne, says there are better ways to tell how sick someone's child is."I wouldn't be going so much on the colour of snot as how the person is feeling and whether they're improving," she said.Why does our snot change colour?Snot is a sticky matrix of goo designed to trap anything that gets into the nose, including dust or viruses, explains Kim Murphy, a senior lecturer in immunology at Monash University.When the body becomes unwell with a cold or flu, the immune system sends a type of white blood cell called a neutrophil to the site of the infection."Our body makes lots [of neutrophils] at the start of infection," she said."Once they've done their job they die, then they get trapped in mucous."Neutrophils have a chemical in them which can turn your snot green, she said.However, the depth of colour can change for reasons other than how severe your illness is."The colour of snot is going to change through the day because you produce less mucous overnight so the neutrophils get a bit concentrated," Dr Murphy said.Does a runny nose mean you're contagious?Not necessarily.As Professor Cheng explains, most people are contagious in the day and hours before symptoms appear and for up to five to seven days afterwards."By the time you get to day five or seven you're not that contagious anymore. It varies slightly between viruses," he said.A runny nose can persist even when the infectious period has passed. (Pexels: Andrea Piacquadio)Professor Danchin agrees, saying "you can't put a hard and fast number on it"."You could probably say you're infectious for somewhere between three and five days after the onset of symptoms," she said.Professor Danchin said while viruses are transmitted in respiratory droplets from sneezes and coughs, they can only spread while you're infectious."It's far more accurate to look at obvious new respiratory symptoms: is it a new runny nose, is it a new cough, is it a new fever?" she said."That person is infectious for two, three or four days after that."Ways to avoid spreading illnesses:Wash your hands regularlyStay up to date with vaccinesAvoid touching your faceCover up coughs and sneezesDr Murphy said sometimes children can be contagious a little longer than adults.NSW Health advises children can be contagious seven to 10 days after the onset of flu symptoms, while for adults it's only three to five.All experts agree that what is coming out of your nose is not a good measure of how contagious you are."At the start of an infection and even before you're symptomatic you're going to be contagious, which is one of the reasons it spreads so quickly," Dr Murphy said.If a runny nose or mild cough is your only symptom, should you stay home?It depends, but you may not need to.Professor Cheng says snot and coughing by itself isn't a reason to keep children home from school or childcare, or even miss work."In a lot of viral illnesses coughs and runny noses can last for weeks after the acute phase," he said."Obviously, you can't exclude children for all that time."It can be hard to tell when to stay home with a cold. (Adobe Stock: Jacob Lun)Dr Murphy said the reason the runny nose and cough often continued after a virus had run its course was because the immune response during infection could lead to general inflammation in the respiratory tract."It takes a while for that to calm down so you're going to have neutrophils," she said.So, at this stage, while there may be white blood cells in the nose mucous there was unlikely to be many, or any, remains of the virus in the secretions.How do you know when to return to work, school or childcare?Professor Cheng said rather than inspecting snot, it was better to look at the child's overall health.Do they feel unwell, or have symptoms like fatigue, fever, rash, pain, or a lack of appetite? Then they should probably stay home."If they feel well then generally, they're fine to return," he said.Dr Murphy said it could be hard as a parent to know when to send a child back to school or care."There's no easy way — you really have to go on those other symptoms like fever, lethargy," she said.Posted Wed 14 Jun 2023 at 7:47pmWednesday 14 Jun 2023 at 7:47pmWed 14 Jun 2023 at 7:47pm, updated Thu 15 Jun 2023 at 1:06amThursday 15 Jun 2023 at 1:06amThu 15 Jun 2023 at 1:06amShare optionsCopy linkFacebookX (formerly Twitter)Top StoriesFamily of teacher's aide killed in preschool crash pay tribute to 'cherished mother, wife, daughter'Topic:Road Accidents and IncidentsPhoto shows Eleanor Bryant, who was killed when a truck crashed into a Victorian preschool, pictured smiling at the races.Barron Trump and AOC expose the problems with the Democratic campaignTopic:US ElectionsPhoto shows Barron Trump and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in a split screen image.

Home / Research / Infection Research / What is RSV? What is RSV? Date Published: June 14, 2023 As the temperature drops, cases of sniffles tend to increase. In addition to the common cold, influenza, and COVID-19, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is another respiratory infection that our community should be aware of. As the temperature drops, cases of sniffles tend to increase. In addition to the common cold, influenza, and COVID-19, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is another respiratory infection that our community should be aware of. RSV is a contagious virus that leads to infections of the respiratory tract and lungs. Typically, the infections reach their peak during the colder months of late autumn and winter in Australia, similar to many other viruses. Worldwide, the virus is accountable for over 100,000 deaths and 3.6 million hospitalisations of children annually. What are the symptoms? A runny nose, cough, sore throat, fever, and headache are some of the common symptoms of RSV. Sometimes those with the virus can also experience ear infections. Difficulties with breathing and wheezing can be experienced in severe cases in younger children and older adults. Symptoms usually begin around five days after exposure to the virus. How is it spread? Like many other respiratory viruses, it is spread through the air. This occurs when someone infected coughs or sneezes, releasing droplets containing the virus. Additionally, it can be spread by touching surfaces contaminated by droplets from an infected person. Who is at risk? RSV can affect anyone; however, most cases are mild. Babies and young children are at risk of breathing complications. This is especially true for those with a weakened immune system. RSV can cause bronchiolitis in babies and young children. This chest infection may require hospital treatment with extra oxygen. Older adults are at risk of more severe symptoms of RSV, particularly those with chronic disease or a weakened immune system. RSV can cause complications such as pneumonia. How can we prevent RSV? As with many respiratory viruses, practicing good hygiene is the best way to prevent RSV from spreading. A person is usually infectious for 3-8 days after symptoms begin. Good hygiene can be practiced by: Staying at home while symptomatic Covering nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing It is important to wear a mask in crowded or high-risk places. Avoiding vulnerable populations at risk of more severe symptoms and complications like babies, young children, and older adults. Wash hands with soap and use sanitiser. Clean surfaces and items that may have been contaminated by an infectious person. Is there a vaccine available? No, there are currently no vaccines available for RSV. How is RSV treated? Most people with RSV improve within a few days to a week. Basic symptom management can help with this, such as pain relief and fever management. Rest and keeping hydrated are also important. In severe cases, hospital admission and treatment with oxygen and intravenous fluid may be necessary.

A 65-year-old Kumbalangi native died two days ago of the virus. West Nile fever is a viral disease very similar to dengue fever or yellow fever produced by flavivirus and spread by mosquitoes.Dr Merlin Mony, associate professor, department of general medicine, division of infectious diseases, Amrita Hospital, Kochi said that the disease manifests itself with flu-like symptoms. “Symptoms are similar to those caused by the influenza virus and may last from five to seven days.The health condition can be improved with symptomatic treatment, which requires supportive management. But if the person is aged and has any other disease, it may require hospitalisation,” she said. The disease can also cause encephalitis, meningitis and meningoencephalitis, and the presence of these illnesses can add to the severity of the disease.When asked about prevention, Dr Merlin said that there are no vaccines available and that the only way to prevent the disease is to prevent mosquito bites. “Mosquito breeding should be prevented. Also, using mosquito-repellent creams and clothes can prevent the spread,” she said. Dr Merlin added that the estimated mortality rate of West Nile fever is 10%, which is ten times that of influenza.Follow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp Download the TNIE app to stay with us and follow the latestmosquitoWest Nile feverShow CommentsRelated StoriesNo stories found.
