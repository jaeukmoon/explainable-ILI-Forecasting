Interpretation of forecasts Reported and forecasted new influenza hospitalizations as of March 21, 2023. This week, 19 modeling groups contributed 20 forecasts that were eligible for inclusion in the ensemble forecasts for at least one jurisdiction. Contributing teams are listed below. Ensemble forecasts combine forecasts from diverse models into one forecast. They have been among the most reliable forecasts in performance for previous influenza and COVID-19 forecasting efforts, but even the ensemble forecasts may not reliably predict rapid changes. The figure shows the number of new confirmed influenza hospital admissions reported in the United States each week from September 1 through March 18 and forecasted new influenza hospital admissions per week over the next 4 weeks, through April 15. Hospitals are required to report laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations to HHS Protect daily. COVID-19 Guidance for Hospital Reporting and FAQs has additional details on this guidance.

This could cause a “twindemic”, in which there are additional burdens on health care resources and public safety compared to those occurring in the presence of a single infection. Amidst the raising trend of co-infections of the two diseases, forecasting both Influenza-like Illness (ILI) outbreaks and COVID-19 waves in a reliable and timely manner becomes more urgent than ever. Accurate and real-time joint prediction of the twindemic aids public health organizations and policymakers in adequate preparation and decision making. However, in the current pandemic, existing ILI and COVID-19 forecasting models face shortcomings under complex inter-disease dynamics, particularly due to the similarities in symptoms and healthcare-seeking patterns of the two diseases.MethodsInspired by the interconnection between ILI and COVID-19 activities, we combine related internet search and bi-disease time series information for the U.S. national level and state level forecasts. Our proposed ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble adopts a new ensemble framework that integrates ILI and COVID-19 disease forecasting models to pool the information between the two diseases and provide joint multi-resolution and multi-target predictions. Through a winner-takes-all ensemble fashion, our framework is able to adaptively select the most predictive COVID-19 or ILI signals.ResultsIn the retrospective evaluation, our model steadily outperforms alternative benchmark methods, and remains competitive with other publicly available models in both point estimates and probabilistic predictions (including intervals).ConclusionsThe success of our approach illustrates that pooling information between the ILI and COVID-19 leads to improved forecasting models than individual models for either of the disease.Plain language summary Data from the internet enables the presence of infectious diseases such as influenza (flu) to be tracked and monitored. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic people will also be infected with flu, impacting health care providers. Predicting both COVID-19 and flu outbreaks in a timely manner enables health care providers and policymakers to prepare for the outbreaks. In this work, we develop a model to jointly predict cases of both COVID-19 and influenza-like illness that can be used at national and state levels in the USA. Our approach is more accurate than alternative similar approaches that predict cases of a single disease, showing the value of predicting the incidence of multiple diseases at the same time.

This is also evident in the remarkable similarity between epidemic trends of flu and COVID-19 (Fig. 1). The fast-developing COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with a severe flu season, would overwhelm the already heavily-burdened health care systems, causing further inconceivable losses4. This calls for an urgent need to establish an accurate and robust bi-disease tracking/forecasting system to provide public health officials with reliable, timely information to make informed decisions to control and prevent the onset of a “twindemic”. To this end, we propose ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble, a principled framework that utilizes the connectivity between flu and COVID-19 to integrate previously proposed forecasting models and adapt to a new era where flu and COVID-19 co-evolve.Fig. 1: Illustration of Georgia (GA)’s real-time COVID-19 cases/deaths (black) growth in comparision with its own lagged %ILI (yellow) and the lagged %ILI of the neighboring states, from 2020-07-04 to 2022-08-13.a COVID-19 real-time cases in GA (thick black curve) vs. lagged 1 week %ILI in GA (yellow curve) and the neighboring states; (b) COVID-19 real-time deaths in GA (thick black curve) and lagged 3 weeks %ILI in GA (yellow curve) and the neighboring states. The underlying data is found in Supplementary Data 1.Full size imageAccurate tracking of flu outbreaks and trends is important but non-trivial. In fact, flu affects 9-41 million people annually between 2010-2020 seasons in the United States, resulting in between 12 and 52 thousands of deaths5. For decades, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) monitors flu activities through Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet), which collects the number of outpatients with Influenza-like Illness (ILI) from thousands of healthcare providers and publishes the weekly ILI percentages (%ILI, i.e., the percentages of outpatients with ILI) at the national, regional levels (10 Health and Human Services (HHS) regions in the US), and state levels. However, due to the time required for data collection and administrative processing, the ILI reports from CDC lag behind real time by 1–2 weeks, and thus unable to provide most accurate and timely information on the disease development. Numerous ILI tracking approaches have therefore been proposed, utilizing statistical models6,7, mechanistic models such as compartmental models8,9,10,11, ensemble approaches12, and deep learning models13,14. Several approaches rely on external signals such as environmental conditions and weather reports15,16; social media, such as Twitter posts17,18 and Wikipedia article views19,20; search engine data, such as: Google21,22,23,24,25, Yahoo26, and Baidu internet searches27.Similarly, many ILI forecasting approaches are adapted and modified to predict the newly emerged COVID-19 pandemic8,28. In particular, machine learning (data-driven) methods28,29,30 and compartmental models31,32,33 are the most popular and prevailing approaches for the publicly-available COVID-19 spread forecasts, according to the weekly forecast reports compiled by CDC34. Yet, they also do not capture the inter-correlation between the two diseases, which could be a crucial factor as both infectious diseases co-evolve.Evidently, COVID-19 is very likely to circulate for a long period of time and co-evolve with ILI, especially when COVID-19 variants continue to evolve1. Hence, a unified robust forecasting framework for both diseases is eminently indispensable.Despite the development in the methodology tracking individual diseases, joint tracking of flu and COVID-19 remains challenging. In the midst of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, %ILI collected by CDC may get “contaminated” in the current season, due to symptomatic similarities with COVID-19 as well as various biological and demographic factors. On the other hand, ILI outbreaks can potentially assist COVID-19 cases and deaths predictions, due to the proximity between the two diseases. However, the inter-correlation between COVID-19 and ILI is latent and varies across geographical areas, which can be challenging to capture and utilize for forecasts.Few attempts have been made to study the connection between COVID-19 and ILI trends, or to incorporate their simultaneous growths for forecasting, while considering the geographical dependence structure (at the state-level). Most of the existing works adapted ILI forecasting model framework and applied towards COVID-19 predictions, or vise-versa. For example, ref. 35 studies the ILI vaccination rates’ correlation with COVID-19 deaths, and states its potential prediction power of deaths’ trends. ref. 36 extends this study to identify association between vaccination rates and COVID-19 infection, deaths and hospitalization, as well as arguing for their forecasting potentials. ref. 37 uses incidence patterns from past flu seasons, COVID-19 time series information, and demographic covariates in a Generalized Linear Model to forecast next week’s county-level case counts, under mild assumptions on the similarity of the transmission mechanisms between COVID-19 and flu. ref. 38, on the other hand, explores seasonal similarities between historical flu seasons and current COVID-19 related signals using a deep clustering module (learn lower-dimensional representation of the signals and reconstruct for forecasting using attention), and produces 1 week ahead independent state-level ILI forecasts.Inspired by the affinity between ILI and COVID-19’s growth trends (Fig. 1), we propose to leverage external COVID-related signals (confirmed cases), along with relevant public search information, for Influenza-like Illness (%ILI) forecasts, and vise-versa for COVID-19 cases and deaths predictions. Yet, to build a COVID-ILI joint prediction model with online search data, many challenges remain to be addressed. For example, the COVID-ILI co-evolution is a new phenomenon, with limited external signals, while relevant internet search information can be noisy and unstable; hence, it would be a great challenge to efficiently learn the model under data paucity and data instability.Here we propose ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble, a principled way to integrate and adapt previously proposed flu and COVID-19 forecasting models to “unseen” scenarios where flu and COVID co-exist. In particular, we modified previously proposed forecasting models by incorporating COVID-19 signals for flu predictions and vise-versa for COVID-19 forecasts. We consolidated the models for two diseases through a spatial-temporal fashion to efficiently capture and incorporate COVID-ILI signals for state-level forecasts, while maintaining model features for national-level forecasts. Finally, we employ an ensemble approach to efficiently combine COVID and flu forecasting methods into one joint framework, which is able to effectively shift focuses between COVID and ILI signals for both diseases’ forecasts, and produce robust forecasts despite unstable search information signals as inputs. The ensemble framework is systematic and comprehensive. Each data-driven sub-model within the framework is intentionally straightforward and unified to prevent over-fitting. Numerical comparisons show that our method performs competitively with other publicly available single-disease forecasting methods. This study further emphasizes the general applicability and the predictive power of online search data for various tasks in disease surveillance.MethodsData acquisition and pre-processingThis paper focuses on the 50 states of the United States, plus Washington D.C for COVID-19 cases and deaths forecasting, while excluding Florida (whose ILI data is not available from CDC) and including New York City and Washington D.C. for %ILI forecasting. For COVID-19 cases and deaths forecasting, we use confirmed cases, confirmed deaths, confirmed new hospital admissions (hospitalization), ILI and Google search query frequencies as inputs. For %ILI forecasting, we use lagged %ILI, COVID-19 cases, and Google search query frequencies as inputs.COVID-19 reporting dataWe use reported COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths of United States from New York Times (NYT)39 as features in our model. We also use COVID-19 confirmed new hospital admissions (hospitalization) released by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)40 as features for our COVID-19 death forecasts. When comparing against other benchmark methods published in CDC COVID-19 Forecast Hub34, we use COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths from JHU CSSE COVID-19 dataset41, a curated dataset used by the CDC at their official website, as the groundtruth. We do not use JHU COVID-19 dataset as input features in our model because JHU COVID-19 dataset retrospectively corrects past confirmed cases and deaths due to reporting error or changes in federal and state policies. NYT dataset, on the other hand, does not revise past data, which gives more realistic forecasts based on the real-time. All data sources are collected from January 21, 2020 to August 13, 2022.CDC’s ILINet dataCDC releases a report of %ILI for the previous week every Friday, which contains the percent of outpatient visits with influenza-like illness for the whole nation, 10 HHS regions, 50 states (except Florida), Washington DC, and New York City (separated from New York State)42. CDC’s %ILI data for this study are collected from January 21, 2020 to August 13, 2022.Google search dataThe online search data used in this paper is obtained from Google Trends43, where one can obtain the search frequencies of a term of interest in a specific region, time frame, and time frequency by typing in the search query on the website. With Google Trends API, we are able to obtain a daily time series of the search frequencies for the term of interest, including all searches that contain all of its words (un-normalized)43.We use 23 highly correlated COVID-19 related Google search queries discovered in prior study44 (in daily frequency) for COVID-19 cases and deaths forecasts, while using ILI related queries (weekly frequency) from previous study22,24 for %ILI forecasts. We obtain the search queries for national, regional (summation from states) and state level. For COVID-19 forecasts, we follow the prior work’s data cleaning procedures44, and find the optimal lag of each Google search query from COVID-19 cases/deaths44 (shown in Table S3 in Supplementary Tables) as inputs to the forecasting models. Figure S1a and S2b (Supplementary Figures) show that the peak of COVID-19 search volume for query “loss of taste” ahead of the peak in reported cases and deaths, confirming strong connections between people’s search behaviors and COVID-19 trends.%ILI data imputation%ILI is weekly indexed while COVID-19 cases and deaths are daily indexed. As we propose a joint forecast framework for both COVID-19 cases/deaths and %ILI in this study, the discrepancy in time stamps between the two needs to be resolved. For this study, we impute daily %ILI as the same number as weekly %ILI, assuming the daily proportion of patients with ILI symptoms is consistent with the weekly number. Imputing daily data also enables larger training sets. We also included a sensitivity analysis in Table S10 (Supplementary Tables).Forecasting methodsNational levelWe propose a joint framework for national level COVID-19 cases and deaths prediction, by additionally incorporating flu information in the previously proposed national COVID-19 forecast model44. Similarly, we also include COVID-19 cases information for %ILI predictions in the Influenza-like Illness forecast model22. Both of the COVID-19 and ILI models are based on the ARGO (AutoRegressive with exogenous GOogle search) method.Specifically, motivated by the robust performance of ARGO method44 and the connection between COVID-19 cases/deaths and lagged %ILI (Fig. 1), we add lagged daily imputed %ILI information in the L1 penalized LASSO regression as extra exogenous variables to produce future 28 days’ COVID-19 cases and death predictions. That is, we use lagged cases, Google search and ILI information as exogenous variables for COVID-19 cases forecasts, and use lagged hospitalization, deaths, Google search and ILI information for COVID-19 death forecasts. Then, we aggregate the daily predictions into future 4 weeks ahead forecasts for reporting and evaluation, consistent with other publicly available benchmark methods. Meanwhile for ILI, we obtain accurate estimates of 1–2 weeks ahead national %ILI using the ARGO method22, by additionally incorporating national COVID-19 cases (weekly aggregated) as exogenous variables. Detailed regression formulations are included in the Supplementary Methods section “ARGO-Nat Prediction”. We denote this method as bi-disease “ARGO-Nat” method, where “Nat” means national-level.State levelTo handle the complicated disease dynamic when COVID-ILI co-evolves, we propose a new ensemble framework, “ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble”, which uses joint COVID-ILI information to guide previously proposed disease forecasting methods for unified COVID-19 and %ILI state-level forecasting.A high-level illustration of our propose method is shown in Fig. 2, where ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble operates in 3 steps.Fig. 2: Flow Chart of the proposed ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble.The top-to-bottom procedure of ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble is presented, starting with raw data input and ending with state-level forecasting outputs. The procedures to forecast COVID-19 cases/deaths are in color blue (left), and the procedures to forecast %ILI is in color red (right). Google: Google search data; NYT: New York Times published COVID-19 data.Full size imageIn the first step, we gather the raw estimates of COVID-19 cases/deaths (left of Fig. 2) and raw estimates of %ILI (right of Fig. 2) in different geographical resolution. For COVID-19, our raw estimates for state m week τ cases/deaths yτ,m are \({\hat{y}}_{\tau ,m}^{GT}\), \({\hat{y}}_{\tau ,{r}_{m}}^{reg}\), \({\hat{y}}_{\tau }^{nat}\), and yτ−1,m, where rm is the region number for state m. Here, we denote GT and reg to be stateegional estimates with internet search information only, and nat to be national estimates (same as prior study44). Similarly, we obtain the raw estimates for state m weekly %ILI pτ,m: \({\hat{p}}_{\tau ,m}^{GT}\)24, \({\hat{p}}_{\tau ,{r}_{m}}^{reg}\)23, \({\hat{p}}_{\tau }^{nat}\)22, pτ−1,m.In the second step, we fit two models separately using the raw estimates from step 1 as inputs. Motivated by the connection between lagged neighboring states’ %ILI and real-time COVID-19 trends (Fig. 1), we first propose the bi-disease “ARGOX-Local” method. For COVID-19 cases/deaths predictions, bi-disease ARGOX-Local incorporates neighboring state’s %ILI information; similarly for %ILI predictions, bi-disease ARGOX-Local includes neighboring state’s COVID-19 cases. Besides bi-disease ARGOX-Local, we also directly employ the previously proposed single-disease forecasting models for COVID-1944 and %ILI24 in the second step, since they have already demonstrated robust results prior to the newly emerged bi-disease dynamics.In the third (last) step, we gather the two methods in step 2, to produce the final winner-takes-all ensemble predictions for future 4 weeks COVID-19 cases/deaths and future 2 weeks %ILI. Particularly, for a training period of (overlapping) 15 weeks, we evaluate both predictors (from two models in the second step) with mean squared error (MSE) and select the one with lowest MSE as the ensemble predictor for future weeks.Implementation details about bi-disease ARGOX-Local, and the final ensemble step ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble, as well as the modifications on previously proposed single-disease forecasting models for COVID-1944 and %ILI24, are presented in the Supplementary Methods section “Newly Proposed Bi-disease ARGOX-Local”. Detailed ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble’s prediction interval calculation is also included in the Supplementary Methods section “ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble”.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.ResultsIn this section, we conduct retrospective estimation of the 1–4 weeks ahead COVID-19 cases and deaths, and 1-2 weeks ahead %ILI, at the US national and state level for the period of July 4, 2020 to August 13, 2022. We analyze our joint framework’s performances by conducting comparison analysis with our own methods, as well as with other publicly available methods from CDC Forecast Hub34,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54 for COVID-19 forecasts. CDC official predictions are a compilation of predictions from all teams that submit their weekly predictions every Monday since January 15th 2020, contributed by different research groups or individuals. Among over 100 teams submitted to CDC, we consider top 6 CDC-published teams for our COVID-19 cases and deaths prediction comparisons. The teams considered in the COVID-19 cases’ and deaths’ retrospective comparisons are slightly different, due to the difference in teams on the forecasting targets, predictions availability, and studied states/periods. We set the COVID-19 cases and deaths forecasting horizon to be 4 weeks, following CDC Forecast Hub’s guidelines34 and the ease of conducting retrospective comparison. On the other hand, we set %ILI forecasting horizon to be 2 weeks, following previously proposed methods22,23,24 and other data-driven %ILI forecasting studies12,25,28,38.For COVID-19 cases and deaths forecast, we focus on United State’s 51 states/districts (including Washington DC). For %ILI forecast, we focus on United State’s 51 states/districts/cities (including Washing DC and New York City, and excluding Florida).We use three metrics to evaluate the accuracy of a point estimate of COVID-19 cases/deaths or %ILI against the actual COVID-19 cases/death (published by JHU) or %ILI (published by CDC) respectively: the root mean squared error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the Pearson correlation (Correlation). RMSE between an estimate \({\hat{y}}_{t}\) and the true value yt over period t = 1, …, T is \(\sqrt{\frac{1}{T}\mathop{\sum }\nolimits_{t = 1}^{T}{\left({\hat{y}}_{t}-{y}_{t}\right)}^{2}}\). MAE between an estimate \({\hat{y}}_{t}\) and the true value yt over period t = 1, …, T is \(\frac{1}{T}\mathop{\sum }\nolimits_{t = 1}^{T}\left\vert {\hat{y}}_{t}-{y}_{t}\right\vert\). Correlation is the Pearson correlation coefficient between \(\hat{{{{{{{{\boldsymbol{y}}}}}}}}}=({\hat{y}}_{1},\ldots ,{\hat{y}}_{T})\) and y = (y1, …, yT).We use two metrics to evaluate the accuracy of probabilistic predictions and prediction intervals of COVID-19 cases/deaths or %ILI against the actual number published by JHU (for COVID-19) or CDC(for %ILI): the weighted interval score (WIS) and the empirical coverage. The weighted interval score (WIS)55 is a proper scoring rule (smaller is better), that takes an entire predictive distribution into account and penalises over- and under-confidence. Following CDC Forecast Hub’s submission guideline34, in this study, the WIS between the true value yt and a predictive distribution at time t is evaluated across 11 prediction intervals with α1 = 0.02, α2 = 0.05, α3 = 0.1, …, α11 = 0.9 (implying nominal coverages of 98%, 95%, 90%, …, 10%). The WIS between the true value y = (y1, …, yT) and predictive distributions over period t = 1, …, T is computed by averaging the WIS across the period t = 1, …, T. The empirical coverage between the true value y = (y1, …, yT) and the prediction intervals over period t = 1, …, T is the proportion of true values falling inside a given central prediction interval with 95% nominal coverage.COVID-19 deathsFor national level analysis, we compare ARGO-Nat with two other baseline models (i) persistence (Naive) and (ii) vanilla ARGO prediction44, where the ground truth is the actual COVID-19 weekly deaths released by JHU dataset41. Vanilla ARGO predictions at the national level are obtained from a L1-penalized regression, utilizing the lagged COVID-19 hospitalization, deaths and optimal lagged Google search terms, while the ARGO-Nat prediction further added lagged national (imputed) ILI as exogenous variables. The Naive (persistence) predictions use current week’s deaths’ counts from New York Times (NYT) as next 1 to 4 weeks’ estimation.Figure S4 and Table S11 (Supplementary Figures and Supplementary Tables) compare the national level estimates against the true COVID-19 weekly deaths. ARGO-Nat estimations improve upon the previous-proposed ARGO method (ref. 44) in almost all prediction horizons with the help of lagged %ILI information serving as extra exogenous features (see Fig. S2 in Supplementary Figures for the coefficient heatmap). Lagged flu information prevents the previous ARGO framework from overshooting, and helps with the speedy recovery from estimation spikes, shown in Fig. S4, especially over the three rapid changing and increasing periods (December 2020 to March 2021, July 2021 to November 2021, and December 2021 to March 2022). However, the connection between %ILI information and COVID-19 deaths (target) deteriorates as prediction horizon extends to 3 and 4 weeks ahead (see Table S5). Also, the improvement is limited from ref. 44, as the search terms and time series’ signals are saturated and the previous ARGO method is already doing a good job on national level (see Fig. S4). This is also shown in Table S12 (Supplementary Tables), when comparing ARGO-Nat estimations with other publicly available methods released by CDC. Overall, ARGO-Nat estimations is able to achieve competitive performance on national level with subtle improvement over ARGO-Inspired (ref. 44).For state-level sensitivity analysis, we compare ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble with three other methods: (i) persistence (Naive) predictions, (ii) single-disease ARGOX method (ref. 44 state-level predictions), (iii) bi-disease ARGOX-Local method (Methods section). Specifically, ref. 44 predictions for each state are obtained from a ARGOX-based ensemble without ILI information, whereas ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble adds the additional bi-disease ARGOX-Local method (Methods section) to produce an ensemble that incorporates ILI information.Table 1 summarizes the overall results of the comparing methods, averaging over the 51 states for the whole period of July 4, 2020 to August 13, 2022. Our ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble method improves upon ref. 44 thanks to bi-disease ARGOX-Local, which is a strong predictor by gathering neighboring states’ deaths and %ILI information as additional feature in the spatial-temporal structure similar to the vector auto-regressive model with exogenous variable (VAR-X). Unlike the other predictors in the ensemble framework, bi-disease ARGOX-Local focuses on each individual state locally while utilizing its neighboring states’ information, which shows its power in the ensemble framework as the pandemic progresses. This is also shown in the detailed break-down of methods contributing to ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble in Table S4 (Supplementary Tables). ARGOX-Local is being selected the most on average (around 35%) in the winner-takes-all ensemble. Other predictors also contribute heavily to the ensemble approach and together they provide us a unified COVID-ILI tracking framework with improved robustness and accuracy. Table 2 further compares against other CDC published teams, and the ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble is among the top three models, throughout the evaluation period. We also examine the model performance during different periods with rapidly changing dynamics when forecasts are most challenging. Table S5 (Supplementary Tables) shows the forecasting performances for three specific periods: COVID-19 second wave (November 2020 to March 2021), COVID-19 Delta variant (July 2021 to November 2021), and COVID-19 Omicron variant (January 2022 to March 2022). ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble is still able to produce accurate short-term forecasts, and reasonable 3–4 weeks forecasts.Table 1 Comparison of different methods for state-level COVID-19 1–4 weeks ahead deaths predictions in 51 U.S. states.Full size tableTable 2 Comparison among different models’ 1 to 4 weeks ahead U.S. states level weekly deaths predictions (from 2020-07-04 to 2022-08-13).Full size tableTo further examine the ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble’s performance gain, we zoom in on the forecasting performances of the two U.S. states, Georgia (GA) and North Carolina (NC) (Table S16 and S18 in Supplementary Tables, and Figs.

Notably, the bi-disease ARGOX-Local model for COVID-19 is more accurate during the increasing periods (e.g. COVID-19 death from Jul 2021 to Oct 2021) and peaking periods (e.g. COVID-19 death in early Oct 2021 and early Feb 2022) than the single disease model. On the other hand, the bi-disease ARGOX-Local model could overshoot and have delayed recovery after peaking periods (e.g. late Feb 2022 post Omicron peak), possibly due to the misleading %ILI signal. Luckily, the ensemble framework is able to select the more robust one between the single-disease and the bi-disease sub-models. Specifically in GA, the ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble selects the bi-disease ARGOX-Local during the increasing periods (Jul 2021 to Oct 2021, and Jan 2022 to Mar 2022), while “falling back” to single disease sub-model post-peak periods (Oct 2021 to Dec 2021, and Mar 2022 to May 2022). We observe similar patterns in bi-disease model performances and ensemble selection behaviors in NC (Table S18 and Fig. S14 in Supplementary Tables and Supplementary Figures) as well as other states.In addition to the point estimates, ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble also gives prediction intervals, as recommended by56. ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble’s prediction interval (PI) is constructed based on the selected method from the ensemble (see Supplementary Methods section “ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble”). Table S7 (Supplementary Tables) shows the prediction intervals’ empirical coverage and weighted interval score (WIS)55, as well as comparisons to other CDC published teams. Table S17 and S19 (Supplementary Tables) further show the prediction intervals’ empirical coverage and WIS comparisons to COVIDhub-ensemble34, zooming into Georgia and North Carolina. Figures S13 and S15 (Supplementary Figures) visualize ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble’s death prediction intervals in the two states, respectively. In summary, our nominal 95% prediction interval has an actual 91% coverage and 89% coverage for 1 and 2 weeks ahead predictions (across all states in Table S7 in Supplementary Tables), suggesting reasonable uncertainty quantification albeit slight overconfidence. Our Gaussian-approximated probabilistic forecast is also competitive for 1–2 weeks ahead predictions in WIS compared to other publicly available methods. Zooming into Georgia and North Carolina, we demonstrate the robustness of ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble’s interval predictions in face of rapidly changing disease dynamics. However, the performance deteriorates as the prediction horizon extends to 3-4 weeks, as we have noted earlier.COVID-19 casesFor COVID-19 cases analysis, we compare with the same baseline models as those in the COVID-19 deaths analysis above. Figure S7 and Table S13 (Supplementary Tables and Supplementary Figures) compare the national level estimates against the true COVID-19 weekly cases. Ref. 44 and ARGO-Nat both steadily outperform the naive method for 1 and 2 weeks ahead. This demonstrates that, similar to deaths forecasting, optimally lagged Google search information and epidemic time series information have strong predictive power on cases trends as well. However, different from COVID deaths, the optimal lags in Google search queries are much shorter from COVID-19 cases (Table S3 in Supplementary Tables). When the forecast horizon extends beyond 2 weeks ahead, the majority of the optimal lags from cases are smaller than the forecast horizon, resulting in Google search terms’ signal deterioration, which in turn gives worse prediction performances than 1 and 2 weeks’. Yet, by incorporating %ILI information as additional features, ARGO-Nat is able to rely more on the time series information and lagged %ILI when Google search queries’ signals deteriorates (see Fig. S7 in Supplementary Figures). Indeed, ref. 44 fall short against the naive estimation in 3 weeks ahead predictions, while ARGO-Nat is still able to produce steady estimations and to quickly recover from overshooting, especially during the Omicron surges from December 2021 to March 2022 and the possible subsequent surges (from July 2022 to September 2022). This is also shown in Table S14 (Supplementary Tables), when comparing ARGO-Nat estimations with other publicly available methods released by CDC. However, ARGO-Nat barely outperforms the naive method for 3 weeks ahead predictions, and falls short for 4 weeks ahead predictions. The short-term signal of search information is an inherent limitation for any long-term predictions (more details in Discussion).For state-level prediction, Table 3 summarizes the overall results of the baseline methods averaging over the 51 states, while Table 4 summarizes the overall results when comparing with top CDC published teams. By incorporating neighboring states’ flu and cases information, our ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble method improves upon ref. 44 and remains competitive among the top performers released by CDC, demonstrating the robustness of COVID-ILI joint framework on cases prediction. This is further illustrated in Table S6 (Supplementary Tables), which shows the state-level forecasting performance in three selected periods with rapidly changing dynamics: COVID-19 second wave (Oct 2020 to Feb 2021), Delta variant (Jul 2021 to Oct 2021), and Omicron variant (Dec 2021 to Mar 2022). ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble maintains its accuracy and robustness throughout the three rapid increasing and decreasing periods, demonstrating its early-warning detection ability, especially for 1–2 weeks ahead forecasts. By taking a closer look at Georgia (GA) and North Carolina (NC), we can see that bi-disease ARGOX-Local model produces robust early-warning estimates before the increasing and peaking periods around Sep 2021 and Jan 2022, and is less prone to overestimation during the Omicron variant surge, especially for 1 and 2 weeks ahead forecasts (Fig. S16, S17 in Supplementary Figures). Single-disease model (ref. 44), on the other hand, performs better around the decreasing period in Nov 2021 and Mar 2022 when the ILI signal is noisy and deteriorating. This qualitative result is similar to the COVID-19 death prediction, and ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble is able to combine the best from the two. Moreover, our prediction intervals for 1 and 2 weeks ahead COVID-19 cases achieve reasonable coverage with WIS comparable to other publicly available methods (Table S8 in Supplementary Tables), demonstrating reliability throughout rapid changing dynamics led by different COVID-19 variants. However, signal deterioration from Internet search information still affects the state-level long-term forecast accuracy and prediction interval coverage (see Tables 3 and 4, and S8 in Supplementary Tables). Overall, our joint COVID-ILI framework is competitive with the top CDC released teams in all error metrics, exhibiting strong short-term state-level cases forecasting while maintains its accuracy compared to the naive method in 3 to 4 weeks forecasting.Table 3 Comparison of different methods for state-level COVID-19 1–4 weeks ahead cases predictions in 51 U.S. states.Full size tableTable 4 Comparison among different models’ 1 to 4 weeks ahead U.S. states level weekly cases predictions (from 2020-07-04 to 2022-08-13).Full size table%ILITo evaluate the accuracy of our %ILI estimations, we compared the estimates with the actual %ILI released by CDC weeks later, and different benchmark methods for national and state level forecasts.At the national level, we compare ARGO-Nat (Methods section) with three baseline methods: (i) the persistence (Naive) estimates, which simply uses CDC’s reported %ILI of the previous week as the estimate for the current week, (ii) estimates by the lag-3 autoregressive model (AR-3 model), (iii) the previously developed ARGO (ref. 22) without COVID-19 information, which is a L1-penalized regression on past %ILI and flu-related Google search queries. Figure S10 (Supplementary Figures) displays the estimates against actual CDC-reported %ILI, whereas Table S15 (Supplementary Tables) further summarizes all estimations’ performances in three error metrics. Ref. 22 outperforms the naive and AR-3 time series estimates in all error metrics for both 1 and 2 weeks ahead forecasts. ARGO-Nat further improves from the single-disease model (ref. 22) by capturing the COVID-19 cases trends during the same period, with 9% RMSE, 6.2% MAE and 0.7% Pearson Correlation improvements on average across 1 and 2 weeks ahead estimates. Both ref. 22 and ARGO-Nat are able to overcome delaying effect in the %ILI time series predictions by utilizing the responsive search behavior data, and predict almost perfectly from January 2021 to July 2021. The bi-disease ARGO-Nat is able to further prevent undesired over-predictions comparing to the single disease model (ref. 22), and “foresees” upcoming increasing trends. For instance, ARGO-Nat is more robust towards detecting the upcoming increasing trends around Aug 2020, Jul 2021, and Jan 2022 (Fig. S10 in Supplementary Figures). In particular, when all the comparing methods exhibit delaying behavior in 2 weeks ahead estimates, the bi-disease ARGO-Nat is able to harness both Google search and COVID-19 cases information to overcome such delay, especially from Jul 2020 to Jan 2021, and from Feb 2022 to Jul 2022.At the state level, we compare ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble (Methods section) with four baseline models: (i) the persistence (Naive) estimates, (ii) estimates by the lag-1 vector autoregressive model (VAR model), (iii) a previously developed single-disease ARGOX model (ref. 24) without COVID-19 information, (iv) bi-disease ARGOX-Local (Methods section), which is a sub-component of ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble. Table 5 shows the comparing methods’ performance averaging across the 50 states and NYC, where ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble gives the leading performance uniformly in all metrics. While ref. 24, ARGO-Local, and ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble all uniformly outperform the naive and VAR1 predictions on average, ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble is the only method consistently outperforms the naive estimates in all the states in all error metric. For Georgia, ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble uniformly selects bi-disease ARGOX-Local during the rapid changing dynamics period (with sudden increases and decreases) from Nov 2020 to Jul 2021, as ARGOX-Local captures the affinity between COVID-19 growth and ILI development (Fig. S18 in Supplementary Figures). On the other hand, when bi-disease ARGOX-Local is less accurate for %ILI during the initial Omicron outbreak (around Dec 2021), ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble is able to quickly recover and fall back to single-disease model ref. 24. Figure S11 (Supplementary Figures) further shows all states’ RMSE, MAE and Pearson Correlation in the violin charts, with mean and standard deviations, where the joint COVID-ILI ensemble framework reveals its robustness over geographical variability and extracts a strong combination from the other two ARGOX alternatives. Lastly, Table S9 (Supplementary Figures) shows the coverage and WIS of the ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble’s prediction intervals across all 50 states and NYC for 1–2 weeks ahead predictions. Our nominal 95% prediction interval has an actual 93% coverage and 89% coverage on average, for 1 and 2 weeks ahead predictions. Meanwhile, ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble can consistently outperform the baseline time series model in WIS, for both 1 and 2 weeks ahead predictions, further demonstrating its robustness and efficient data-driven signal utilization.Table 5 Comparison of different methods for state-level %ILI 1 and 2 weeks ahead forecasts in 51 U.S. states.Full size tableDiscussionIn this paper we propose to jointly forecast COVID-19 and Influenza-like Illness in the United States. At the national level, our ARGO-Nat is built upon previously proposed ARGO44 method and incorporates COVID-19 cases and %ILI as additional exogenous variables for national level %ILI and COVID-19 cases/deaths predictions. At the state level, ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble is a unified COVID-ILI forecasting framework that efficiently combines multi-source, multi-resolution, bi-disease information, and provides accurate, reliable, real-time COVID-19 cases, deaths and %ILI forecasts, while most previously proposed methods that utilize internet search information22,24,44 only focus on single disease forecasting. Motivated by the interconnection between %ILI and COVID-19 cases/deaths trends (Fig. 1) within the state and across neighboring states, this study further proposes bi-disease ARGOX-Local which additionally gathers neighboring states’ %ILI information for COVID-19 cases/deaths forecast, and utilizes COVID-19 cases for %ILI forecast. Lastly, by aggregating bi-disease ARGOX-Local and the previously proposed single-disease COVID-19 or %ILI forecasting methods in a winner-takes-all ensemble fashion, ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble provides accurate, reliable real-time COVID-ILI joint prediction at the state level. By incorporating cross-regional and temporal correlation of both COVID-19 and Influenza-like Illness activities, ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble outperforms most benchmark methods and achieves reasonable performance against other publicly available models.At the national level, the strong performance of ARGO-Nat can be attributed to two factors. First, ARGO-Nat is built upon the established COVID-1944 and Influenza-like Illness tracking22 frameworks, both of which have already shown their strength by utilizing temporal auto-correlation and dependence between people search behaviors and the target time series information. Second, ARGO-Nat takes a step further by complementing the established single-disease COVID-19 and Influenza-like Illness forecasting frameworks with the pooled information from both diseases. Specifically, by incorporating lagged Influenza-like Illness and COVID-19 information, ARGO-Nat shows performances improvements for COVID-19 cases/deaths and %ILI future predictions, with fast recovery from over-estimations, and smoother forecasts (especially when forecasting 3-4 weeks ahead for COVID-19 cases and deaths).At the state level, similar two key factors contribute to our ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble model. First, the introduction of the bi-disease constituent model, ARGOX-Local, effectively combines Google search data, Influenza-like Illness activity data, and COVID-19 cases/deaths to produce state-level COVID-19 cases/deaths estimates or %ILI estimates. This bi-disease ARGOX-Local is an intermediate method that connects Influenza-like Illness and COVID-19 information in geographical proximity, and is a joint COVID-ILI method that uses each other’s growth trend to help the other, which can efficiently detect upcoming surges and peaking periods. Second, to further improve accuracy and robustness, we efficiently combine bi-disease ARGOX-Local with the previously proposed single-disease COVID-19 and %ILI single-disease forecasting methods24,44 to produce winner-takes-all ensemble (ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble) forecast. These methods are adapted directly from the established Influenza-like Illness and COVID-19 predictions with minimal changes, which reduces the chance of over-fitting. The previously proposed winner-takes-all ensemble framework44 also naturally incorporates bi-disease ARGOX-Local as one additional constituent model, and is able to robustly select the “best” estimate among the sub-models during rapid changing dynamics. Furthermore, the ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble is able to outperform the constituent models for all states in all 1 to 4 weeks ahead COVID-19 cases/deaths predictions, and 1–2 weeks ahead %ILI predictions, while remaining its accuracy during the Omicron COVID-19 variant in early 2022. When comparing with other state-of-arts models from CDC for COVID-19 forecasts, our national and state-level models are also able to perform reasonably well, further demonstrating the strength of the joint-disease prediction framework.Like all big-data-based models, our model has its limitations. ARGO-Nat and ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble’s accuracy depends on the reliability and stability of its inputs—Google Trends data, historical %ILI data from CDC, and COVID-19 cases/deaths data from NYT. Since the optimal lags between COVID-19 cases/deaths and Google search queries have short time-span (Table S3 in Supplementary Tables), information in Google search data deteriorates as forecast horizons expand, which could potentially impact the robustness and accuracy of our 3 and 4 weeks ahead COVID-19 predictions. Similarly, the proposed ARGO-Nat (national-level) and ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble (state-level) gradually lose their predictive power towards %ILI, when the forecasting horizon extends to 3 and 4 weeks and thus we focus on 1–2 weeks ahead %ILI predictions in this study. One hypothesis is that the COVID-19 symptomatic and contagious periods last longer than Influenza-like Illness57, and thus the COVID-19 time series and related Google search information are more predictable for COVID-19 than those for %ILI for longer forecasting horizons. The long-term forecasts’ deterioration is indeed a limitation, due to the data-driven nature of our proposed models, impacting the predictions for the onset and the finish of the disease season. Fortunately, by recognizing the correlation between Influenza-like Illness activities and COVID-19 growth trend at both national and state levels, %ILI and COVID-19 cases/deaths are able to rely more on each other when Google search queries’ signal degenerates, which enable robust estimations and fast recoveries from overshooting. Although our current model can steadily outperform benchmark methods, models to further capture long-term COVID-19 trends, and boost long-term forecasting performances could be an interesting future direction.Another limitation is the retrospective nature of this study. Although we are not using any “forward looking” information that wouldn’t be available at the time of prediction to reflect “real-time” performances, the input data sources could still be subject to backfill and revisions. This issue is circumvented for COVID-19 as we use the New York Times (NYT) github COVID-19 dataset39 as the input to our models, which does not revise past data. Yet, CDC reported %ILI5, could be subject to revisions, due to reporting delays from health-care providers. However, prior Influenza-like Illness forecasting studies have shown that %ILI back-fill and modifications typically would not impact forecasting performances too much58,59.In addition, it should be noted that our estimation targets (treated as the groundtruth), JHU COVID-19 dataset (cases, deaths) and CDC’s %ILI, can be unreliable. JHU COVID-19 dataset41 retrospectively corrects past confirmed cases and deaths due to reporting error, especially during the early stage of COVID-19. Furthermore, due to wide availability of rapid antigen tests, the COVID-19 confirmed case count might be an underestimation of the true volume of infections60. On the other hand, %ILI is only a proxy for the actual flu incidence in the population. First of all, %ILI could exhibit high noise at the state-level, as it is calculated from a sample of outpatient visits with influenza-like symptoms and subjects to retrospective revisions24. Moreover, the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent changes in public’s health care-seeking behaviors further impact %ILI’s representation power of laboratory confirmed influenza, as it will capture visits due to any respiratory pathogen that presents with the symptoms of fever plus cough or sore throat, including influenza, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)42. Nevertheless, under the current pandemic situation, accurate predictions of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and%ILI at both national and state levels are still valuable for optimizing resource allocations, and healthcare interventions. For example, the %ILI surveillance data can still reveal the general trend of influenza activity in a particular region and provide invaluable information for optimizing where, when and what influenza viruses are circulating42. Studies investigating alternative indicators for COVID-19 and flu incidence in the population can be found in61,62. In addition, CDC FluSight is also investigating additional surveillance components to track seasonal influenza activities, including laboratory-confirmed influenza hospital admissions63. Therefore, considering alternative influenza activities’ indicators as forecasting targets and/or exogenous information in the model could be an important future direction.In light of recurrent Influenza-like Illness waves and the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, accurate joint-disease tracking of epidemic activity at different geographical levels has become more important than ever. Our ARGO-Nat and ARGOX-Joint-Ensemble provide high-precision national and state-level surveillance information, which would enable timely decision making and optimal resource reallocation in the face of a potential twindemic. The reliable estimations by our joint COVID-ILI framework give public more insights into both diseases and can serve as valuable resources for public health officials.

Influenza Type B may be the culprit. ’The annual flu season often arrives in winter and rises to a peak, before declining until the following winter. Last year, it came late. This year, it was early.However, while the 2022/2023 flu wave appeared to have hit its peak around Christmas time, that was not the end of the story. The number of flu cases plateaued in late January before ticking upwards again.Europe’s 2022-2023 flu season peaked early, but has bounced back. Source: European Centre for Disease Prevention & Control (ECDC)It appears this flu season in Europe will have twin peaks. That’s not unheard of, but it’s worth noting that last year’s Australian flu season came early but had one big peak. Europe often looks to the southern hemisphere for clues as to how influenza epidemics might play out.Australia’s 2022 flu season: early arrival of a single, large wave. Source: Australian Government, Department of Health & Aged CareThe question is: what is driving the recent increase in cases across Europe?Data from the ECDC suggest the second wave is largely due to increased circulation of type B influenza virus. Overall, influenza A(H3N2) viruses have dominated the season, but there has been a late surge in influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza type B viruses.Let’s back up a little to look at the names of flu viruses. The H and N parts of the virus are commonly used to name influenza A viruses. The H in the names of these viruses stands for Haemagglutinin, a protein found on the outside of flu viruses that attaches it to the cells in our body. The N in the name of flu viruses means Neuraminidase, a family of enzymes. Both (particularly Haemagglutinin) are targets for flu vaccines.Once attached, the virus can open the door to the cell, take over its internal machinery, and turn it into a virus factory. Your cells begin to produce lots of copies of the virus which spread through your body.When cells copy viruses’ genes, they sometimes make mistakes. Errors in the H and N proteins are common and give rise to new viruses. In fact, when an animal or person is infected with more than one virus at once, they can produce a new virus that combines parts of both.‘Because of this high error rate, we see constant change in viruses which necessitates frequent updates to the vaccine,’ Dr David Wentworth, Chief of virology surveillance at the Influenza Division of the US CDC told a WHO webinar earlier this month. ‘Some of these changes are a disadvantage to the virus; other times it benefits the virus in evading the host.’The A viruses commonly found around the world include A/H3N2 which caused the 1968 flu pandemic, and A/H1N1pdm09 which caused the 2009/2010 pandemic. The influenza B viruses follow a different naming system. The most common B viruses are B/Victoria and B/Yamagata. However, detection of these B viruses has been much lower in recent years. Some were even beginning to wonder if they might be on the verge of extinction. But their contribution to the European double-barrelled flu season suggests rumours of their death may have been exaggerated.New flu viruses are a pandemic riskThe tendency for flu viruses to change pose a risk of pandemics. Flu viruses that can infect birds (notably A(H5)) are a particular concern. These animal viruses usually do not infect humans. In most cases where an avian virus infects a human, there is no further human-to-human transmission.This was the case in the recent avian flu cluster in Cambodia, for example, in which an 11-year-old girl died.‘The majority of zoonotic infections from animal to human are self-limiting, with just one or two cases. Those viruses don’t take off,’ says Dr Richard Webby, Director, WHO Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds. ‘But when they do, we have a pandemic.’He said the overall threat from zoonotic influenza is ‘not subsiding’ and scientists must stay on top of which viruses are circulating and be prepared to develop vaccines if required.Dr Sylvie Briand, Director of Epidemic & Pandemic Prevention and Preparedness at WHO, said the most likely origin of the next pandemic is a virus that jumps from animals to humans.‘In the event that it’s an avian flu virus, we need to be ready to protect people around the world through vaccination,’ she said. ‘The goal is not only about protecting against seasonal influenza, but anticipating potential new pandemic flu viruses to make the world a safer place.’ RELATED STORIESTime to expand the EU flu vaccination target?October 22, 2024Portugal in focus: public trust drives vaccine uptake at all agesSeptember 23, 2024 Cancel replyName Email Website Comment Δ NextShareShare storyPrevious © Copyright 2022, All Rights Reserved.Guiding principlesPrivacy policy© Copyright 2022, All Rights Reserved.

The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) is calling for measures to be enacted that control the spread of infection in preparation for a simultaneous outbreak with the presumption of a total of 750,000 people (450,000 infected with COVID-19 and 300,000 with influenza) as the maximum number of people infected per day. Against this backdrop, Hitachi initiated a proof-of-concept test on November 28, 2022 at MUJI Grand Front Osaka by installing monitor that display information on the predicted spread of influenza with the aim of raising influenza prevention awareness among customers, while at the same time placing Muji hot water bottles, soups and other products, next to the monitor. Monitor displaying forecasts on outbreaks Image: An influenza forecast displayed on a monitor MUJI Grand Front Osaka is patronized by more than 600,000 people a year who buy groceries and other daily necessities. Inside the store, a monitor displaying information forecasting influenza outbreaks has been installed, enabling customers to check the expected influenza outbreak status in Osaka on a four-level basis up to two weeks in advance. The outbreak forecast information is provided by Hitachi's Infectious Disease Forecasting Service, which uses AI to make predictions. Mr. Hisashi Takeyama of Ryohin Keikaku, block manager of seven stores in Osaka. Mr. Hisashi Takeyama of Ryohin Keikaku, which operates Muji stores, said, "People worldwide are preparing for influenza outbreaks in addition to COVID-19 outbreaks. By providing outbreak forecast information to customers who come to our store, we hope to contribute to the comfortable lives of our customers by encouraging them to take precautions to avoid contracting influenza." Next to the monitor is a display of products that change weekly based on the themes of "Eat," "Sleep," "Walk," "Clean," and "Warm." Products displayed next to the monitor "Muji will be placing products, such as masks and hot water bottles, next to the monitor to offer suggestions for products that Muji believes will be useful during that season. This week's theme is "Eat," and we have prepared minestrone soup and other products. Our suggestion is to drink soup to warm your body and mind, and lead a regular life. We believe that this will lead to a healthy lifestyle," says Mr. Takeyama. Achieving a "truthful and sustainable life for all" Mr. Takeyama during the interview Mr. Takeyama says the impetus for the proof-of-concept testing is related to Ryohin Keikaku's core value: "To contribute to society and people." The new medium-term business plan formulated in 2021 indicates, among other things, that Muji stores will tackle problems in local communities. Mr. Takeyama continues: "Providing customers with influenza outbreak forecast information in the store to help prevent infection is part of this plan. We also believe that this is important in accomplishing our company's goal of a 'truthful and sustainable life for all.'" Although the proof-of-concept test began in this way, there were some initial concerns from within the company about providing information in the store, such as the possibility that customers who saw the outbreak forecast information might feel uneasy. Mr. Takeyama stated, "We tried to persuade these people to understand that this is an initiative that will benefit the community." Disseminating information in the same way as weather forecasts “This sort of initiative gives me peace of mind,” said a woman in her 30s living in Osaka (on the left in the photo). A woman in her 30s living in Osaka who came shopping that day with her baby said, "I think it will be useful for infection control," and then went on to say: "This kind of information makes people think for a second that 'the flu is going around,' so it makes a lot of people pay attention to the flu. I will buy soup to keep warm from the inside out." A woman in her 30s living in Nishinomiya city also said, "I had never seen outbreak forecast information before, so I hope that more and more information will be disseminated just like weather forecasts. I think it would be great to have this kind of information in the store to prevent infection from viruses when coming to shop on a whim." Mr. Takeyama noted: "We thought that, by providing this kind of information in MUJI Grand Front Osaka, which is in the center of Osaka, we could be of service to more customers. We have only just begun, but we will continue to monitor customer trends through trial and error." Contributing to reducing the risk of catching influenza Shintaro Nakagawa of Hitachi Social Information Services during the interview The Infectious Disease Forecasting Service provides information on future influenza outbreaks and helps reduce the risk of contracting the virus. Shintaro Nakagawa, who is in charge of the service's business development at Hitachi, had the following to say about his aspirations for the future: "We will digitally analyze various things, including product sales and customer feedback, and reflect the results in service upgrades to make the service even-more valuable to users by improving convenience. We at the Hitachi Group will continue to help people through 'social innovation businesses' such as this service."

Read Today's Paper H3N2 influenza virus symptoms include fever & cough; doctors prescribe best time to take annual flu vaccineSECTIONSH3N2 influenza virus symptoms include fever & cough; doctors prescribe best time to take annual flu vaccineBy Tanushree Banerjee, ET OnlineLast Updated: Mar 20, 2023, 10:10:00 AM ISTRate StoryFollow usShareFont SizeAbcSmallAbcMediumAbcLargeSavePrintCommentSynopsisMaharashtra, Haryana & Karnataka have reported one death each so far.iStockThe outbreak of the H3N2 influenza virus is reaching alarming levels in India.States and Union territories like Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Odisha, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Goa, Bihar, Maharashtra and Puducherry have witnessed a spike in cases, with one death each reported in Haryana and Karnataka.ET Panache Digital reached out to doctors dealing with influenza to help you understand the H3N2 virus.What's This New Virus?H3N2, a type of flu, is a dominant subtype of influenza A virus after the H1N1. The strains of H1N1 were found in humans during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic and the 2009 swine flu phase.H3N2 was discovered in 1968 during the global outbreak of the Hong Kong flu pandemic — known as the third influenza pandemic of the 20th century. It is believed that a 1957 pandemic flu virus, caused by the influenza A subtype H2N2, gave birth to H3N2 after an antigenic shift — when a virus goes through genetic mutation and evolves.Whom Does It Affect?H3N2 affects all age groups. Dr Harish KV, Consultant-Internal Medicine, Fortis Hospital, Richmond Road, Bengaluru, has a warning for elderly patients with comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension, asthma, obesity, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, among other things. "It's not dangerous, but elderly patients and smokers must be careful," he said. iStockExperts reiterated that people should consult a doctor before getting their vaccination.Talking about people with high blood sugar levels, Dr Subrata Das, Senior Consultant-Internal Medicine and Diabetology at Sakra World Hospital, Bengaluru, said that people with uncontrolled diabetes were more prone to any infections, including H3N2 influenza. "People with diabetes should keep their blood glucose levels under control," he said.People with diabetes also have to maintain good hygiene practices, wear masks in crowded places and take annual influenza vaccination after consulting their endocrinologist.What's Causing The Spike In Cases?Dr Vasunethra Kasargod, Consultant-Pulmonology at Manipal Hospital, Millers Road, said that he witnessed one-two cases per day in December, which has now jumped to 30-40 patients per day.Weather changes are causing the rapid spread of these viruses. "Current weather is conducive for the virus to multiply and also transmit rapidly among people. Hence, there is a big spike in cases. Also, hospitalisation rates have increased due to this surge," Dr Kasargod said.However, experts said the virus was not dangerous under normal circumstances, and hospitalisation was uncommon. The Union Ministry of Health, last week, said the cases rising from seasonal influenza, including H3N2, were expected to see a decline from the end of March. iStockH3N2 affects all age groups.Symptoms To Watch Out For The virus, which belongs to the flu family, affects patients like a coronavirus does — damaging or affecting the lungs followed by a fever. The symptoms of influenza are very much the same as the common flu. Common symptoms include fever, headache, runny nose, sore throat, fatigue, stuffy nose, cold and cough with white-coloured phlegm. The infection starts with a high fever for nearly four-eight days, and cold and cough can linger for two to three weeks. Some mild signs of the infection are body pain, headache, nausea, malaise and diarrhoea. Dr Das said that fatigue can last for a week, and sometimes patients can also experience severe muscle pain.Most patients are showing mild symptoms in this round of infection, says Dr Kasargod. “It can turn severe for one per cent of the patients. Those suffering from severe illness can experience pneumonia, a drop in their oxygen saturation causing breathlessness and wheezing. Patients with such symptoms have to be hospitalised immediately," Dr Kasargod said.The Road To RecoveryThe infection from the H3N2 influenza virus usually lasts between five and seven days. While six-eight days are the usual recovery period, some people even take 10-12 days to recover completely. Earlier, the fever usually lasted for three-four days. But this time, the fever subsides only after 6-7 days. Explaining the progression, Dr Das said, "After three days, the fever might decrease. Even if there is a minor infection, the cough may last longer. It is recommended that you see your doctor again if the cough becomes worse and the fever doesn't go down after three days. Antivirals are usually not required in these influenza cases, except in some."A majority of the cases are not severe, doctors reiterated. AgenciesHealthy habits to followStaying SafeSome experts have said it was time to bring back the Covid pandemic protocols.Wearing masks, following social distancing and maintaining basic hygiene are key to keeping the flu at bay. Focus on eating healthy, staying hydrated, working out regularly and getting good sleep.The rising cases of H3N2 influenza were not a cause of concern yet, but diabetic patients must take the annual flu vaccine on doctor’s advice, said Dr Das. "People with diabetes should also avoid crowded places and wear masks. If they contract the infection, they are likely to develop complications like pneumonia, viral meningitis and infections of the lungs, brain and other organs," he added. H3N2 virus outbreak raises concerns across India; 'wear mask in crowded places,' Health Ministry advisesAnother suspected outbreak of Covid-19 like influenza is raising concerns across India. ICU admissions have risen because of the influenza infection. The health minister of the state is saying that H3N2 is not fatal and can be cured with medical treatment. He also said that the diseased patients had other medical conditions. Many states have released advisories to stay ahead of the curve. People have become more cautious about viruses after Covid-19.Another Dose Of Vaccination? Doctors recommend getting the influenza vaccine, after doctor's advice, for better protection.Dr Das of Sakra World said that the influenza vaccine would protect healthy adults even when the circulating viruses do not exactly match the vaccine viruses. However, influenza vaccination might be less effective in prevention for the elderly, he said. But it would reduce the intensity of the infection.One can get the flu even after the vaccine, but it is essential to take the shot as it will reduce the complications and severity of the infection.Dr Harish, too, suggested that everyone take the flu shot during an outbreak, especially children and elderly people with comorbidities. The vaccine should be taken when the patients do not show any symptoms. It is a must for women at any stage of pregnancy, children between six months and five years, elderly individuals (aged more than 65 years), and individuals with chronic medical conditions. Agencies(L-R) Dr Harish KV of Fortis Hospital, Dr Vasunethra Kasargod of Manipal Hospital and Dr Subrata Das of Sakra World HospitalDr Kasargod of Manipal Hospital said the vaccine was mandatory for high-risk patients who have asthma, chronic diseases of the lung, kidney and heart, immuno-compromised and geriatric patients. Usually, the vaccine would have no side-effects, said Dr Das. However, some might experience symptoms like body aches and fever for one to two days after the vaccination, which can be treated with paracetamol. Experts reiterated that people consult a doctor before vaccination.Watch out for mild fever that is self-limiting. The most important thing to remember is to take the vaccine every year. "Every year, around September or April is the best time to take the vaccine," the Manipal Hospital pulmonologist added.

These effector memory B cells appear poised for a rapid serum antibody response upon secondary challenge one year later, and evidence shows that the cells in this subset differ from all previously described memory B cell subsets.Memory B cells play a critical role to provide long-term immunity after a vaccination or infection. In a study published in the journal Immunity, researchers describe a distinct and novel subset of memory B cells that predict long-lived antibody responses to influenza vaccination in humans. These effector memory B cells appear to be poised for a rapid serum antibody response upon secondary challenge one year later, Anoma Nellore, M.D., Fran Lund, Ph.D., and colleagues at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and Emory University report. Evidence from transcriptional and epigenetic profiling shows that the cells in this subset differ from all previously described memory B cell subsets. The UAB researchers identified the novel subset by the presence of FcRL5 receptor protein on the cell surface. In immunology, a profusion of different cell-surface markers is used to identify and separate immune-cell types. In the novel memory B cell subset, FcRL5 acts as a surrogate marker for positive expression of the T-bet transcription factor inside the cells. Various transcription factors act as master regulators to orchestrate the expression of many different gene sets as various cell types grow and differentiate. Nellore, Lund and colleagues found that the FcRL5+ T-bet+ memory B cells can be detected seven days after immunization, and the presence of these cells correlates with vaccine antibody responses months later. Thus, these cells may represent an early, easily monitored cellular compartment that can predict the development of a long-lived antibody response to vaccines. This could be a boon to the development of a more effective yearly influenza vaccine. “New annual influenza vaccines must be tested, and then manufactured, months in advance of the winter flu season,” Lund said. “This means we must make an educated guess as to which flu strain will be circulating the next winter.” Why are vaccine candidates made so far in advance? Pharmaceutical companies, Lund says, need to wait many weeks after vaccinating volunteers to learn whether the new vaccine elicits a durable immune response that will last for months. “One potential outcome of the current study is we may have identified a new way to predict influenza vaccine durability that would give us an answer in days, rather than weeks or months,” Lund said. “If so, this type of early ‘biomarker’ could be used to test flu vaccines closer to flu season — and moving that timeline might give us a better shot at predicting the right flu strain for the new annual vaccine.” Seasonal flu kills 290,000 to 650,000 people each year, according to World Health Organization estimates. The global flu vaccine market was more than $5 billion in 2020. Anoma Nellore, M.D.Photography: Steve WoodTo understand the Immunity study, it is useful to remember what happens when a vaccinated person subsequently encounters a flu virus. Following exposure to previously encountered antigens, such as the hemagglutinin on inactivated influenza in flu vaccines, the immune system launches a recall response dominated by pre-existing memory B cells that can either produce new daughter cells or cells that can rapidly proliferate and differentiate into short-lived plasmablasts that produce antibodies to decrease morbidity and mortality. These latter B cells are called “effector” memory B cells. “The best vaccines induce the formation of long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells,” said Lund, the Charles H. McCauley Professor in the UAB Department of Microbiology and director of the Immunology Institute. “Plasma cells live in your bone marrow and make protective antibodies that can be found in your blood, while memory B cells live for many years in your lymph nodes and in tissues like your lungs. “Although plasma cells can survive for decades after vaccines like the measles vaccine, other plasma cells wane much more quickly after vaccination, as is seen with COVID-19,” Lund said. “If that happens, memory B cells become very important because these long-lived cells can rapidly respond to infection and can quickly begin making antibody.” In the study, the UAB researchers looked at B cells isolated from blood of human volunteers who received flu vaccines over a span of three years, as well as B cells from tonsil tissue obtained after tonsillectomies. They compared naïve B cells, FcRL5+ T-bet+ hemagglutinin-specific memory B cells, FcRL5neg T-betneg hemagglutinin-specific memory B cells and antibody secreting B cells, using standard phenotype profiling and single-cell RNA sequencing. They found that the FcRL5+ T-bet+ hemagglutinin-specific memory B cells were transcriptionally similar to effector-like memory cells, while the FcRL5neg T-betneg hemagglutinin-specific memory B cells exhibited stem-like central memory properties. Antibody-secreting B cells need to produce a lot of energy to churn out antibody production, and they also must turn on processes that protect the cells from some of the detrimental side effects of that intense metabolism, including controlling the dangerous reactive oxygen species and boosting the unfolded protein response. Fran Lund, Ph.D.,Photography: Steve WoodThe FcRL5+ T-bet+ hemagglutinin-specific memory B cells did not express the plasma cell commitment factor, but did express transcriptional, epigenetic and metabolic functional programs that poised these cells for antibody production. These included upregulated genes for energy-intensive metabolic processes and cellular stress responses. Accordingly, FcRL5+ T-bet+ hemagglutinin-specific memory B cells at Day 7 post-vaccination expressed intracellular immunoglobulin, a sign of early transition to antibody-secreting cells. Furthermore, human tonsil-derived FcRL5+ T-bet+ memory B differentiated more rapidly into antibody-secreting cells in vitro than did FcRL5neg T-betneg hemagglutinin-specific memory B cells.

Texas 1st Texas case of avian influenza in mammal confirmed in skunk by: Abigail Jones Posted: Mar 21, 2023 / 10:50 AM CDT Updated: Mar 21, 2023 / 05:32 PM CDT by: Abigail Jones Posted: Mar 21, 2023 / 10:50 AM CDT Updated: Mar 21, 2023 / 05:32 PM CDT SHARE CARSON COUNTY, Texas (KXAN) — A skunk recovered from Carson County is Texas’ first confirmed case of avian influenza in a mammal. The National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) confirmed this week the presence of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in a striped skunk recovered from the north Texas county. According to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, HPAI is a highly contagious virus that transmits easily among wild and domestic birds and is detected in all U.S. states except Hawaii. The virus can spread directly between animals and indirectly through environmental contamination. For mammals, current data shows transmission occurs primarily through the consumption of infected animal carcasses, though mammal-to-mammal transmission does not appear sustainable, TPWD said in a news release. TPWD said other mammal species susceptible to HPAI include foxes, raccoons, bobcats, opossums, mountain lions and black bears. Symptoms can include incoordination and stumbling, tremors, seizures, lack of fear of people, lethargy, coughing and sneezing, or sudden death. Because of the ease of transmission, TPWD recommends that wildlife rehabilitators also remain cautious when intaking wild animals with clinical signs consistent with HPAI and consider quarantining animals to limit the potential for HPAI exposures to other animals within the facility. The transmission risk of avian influenza from infected birds to people is low, but TPWD said the public should take basic protective measures, like wearing gloves, face masks, and handwashing, if contact with wild animals can’t be avoided. Those who locate wild animals with signs consistent with HPAI should immediately contact their local TPWD wildlife biologist. Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

Joseph Payne | 03/20/2023 | 8 min read Credit: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIHIn 2013, Joseph Payne and Pad Chivukula were feeling entrepreneurial and decided to start a new company with just $15,000. Arcturus Therapeutics was born. Since then, they have raised over $500 million from investment capital and grown the company to around 175 employees. The company’s focus has always been on the safe and effective delivery of high-efficacy, therapeutic mRNA – which meant the company was well placed when all eyes turned to mRNA during the COVID-19 pandemic. When the SARS-CoV-2 virus first started as an epidemic in the southeast Pacific, the Singapore government reached out to Arcturus to learn more about the company’s self-amplifying mRNA (samRNA) technology. At the time, Payne says no one had any idea how much COVID-19 would transform the world, and how vital mRNA technology would be in saving it…What happened next? Find out in our interview with Payne. Tell us more about Arcturus’ collaborations… We received funding from Singapore’s Economic Development Board for our early research efforts to identify and evaluate samRNA vaccine candidates. Vietnam then stepped forward and we received funding from the Vingroup – the number one corporation in the country – for a large-stage clinical trial. Our technology was proven safe and effective – and we saw 95 percent efficacy in protecting people from hospitalization and death due to the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant. We now believe that we have a comprehensive data set that showcases how samRNA vaccine technology could be a next-generation platform for boosters against COVID-19, and how the same samRNA technology may be employed in the fight against other epidemics, including influenza. In 2022, we announced a partnership with CSL – one of the top flu vaccine companies in the world – to develop and commercialize next generation mRNA vaccines using our STARR and LUNARtechnologies for SARS-CoV-2, influenza, pandemic preparedness, and other respiratory infections. Arcturus received an up-front payment of $200 million from CSL with additional development and commercial milestone payments, and 40 percent profit sharing for the COVID vaccine franchise. CSL Seqirus, a division of CSL, has built an extraordinarily successful flu vaccine enterprise. We look forward to helping CSL Seqirus advance the next generation mRNA (sa-mRNA) technology through their flu vaccine pipeline.And there’s still more! We are also collaborating with a Japanese company called Meiji, with whom we are running the first phase III trial ever to directly compare samRNA technology to conventional mRNA technology in a non-inferiority comparison trial involving 780 participants. This potentially approvable trial could allow us to file for registration and commercialization in Japan. Why are you so excited about the potential of samRNA? samRNA vaccines are a much lower dose technology; you are infecting less mRNA, using less excipients, and so on. We have been evaluating a dose level of 5 µg – in contrast to the 30, 50, or even 100 µg doses seen in conventional mRNA vaccines. samRNA vaccines could also be more effective. Conventional mRNA vaccines make the antigen for 1 to 2 days, giving the body a limited window in which to “see” the antigen and initiate an immune response. With samRNA, vaccines express antigen for one to two weeks, allowing for a much stronger and longer-lasting immune response. We have also found in our early phase II trials that antibodies generated from our vaccine are protective against alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2. Finally – and crucially – our platform produces a lyophilized vaccine, which eliminates the supply challenges of dealing with cold chain, a significant headache for existing vaccines which must be transported and stored in controlled refrigerated or frozen conditions. This is hard enough for vaccines being moved across the country, but a nightmare for international shipments. Lyophilized vaccines, by contrast, can be shipped and stored at ambient temperature, making stockpiling and distribution a far simpler and less error-prone process.Will vaccines made using samRNA still need regular updates? So far, it seems as if the samRNA vaccine platform may generate antigens that provide a broader immune response, which may mean that the vaccines do not need to be updated as frequently as with conventional mRNA – but we still need to collect more data. That said, I think it is inevitable, no matter the technology, that vaccines will need to be updated on a periodic basis because viruses like influenza and SARS-CoV-2 can rapidly mutate. It’s only a matter of time before the mutation is substantial enough that you need to update the technology to capture and protect against the new variant. Is pandemic flu still a concern? The WHO warns all governments globally about what could be the next outbreak or pandemic – and number one on that list is pandemic flu. If avian flu or swine flu mutate to spread to humans then it could be very, very serious – far worse than what we have seen with COVID-19. Consequently. there is now renewed emphasis in preparing and stockpiling for another pandemic. Arcturus has also been active in the area of pandemic preparedness, working with BARDA (Biomedical ​Advanced Research and Development Authority), the US government agency charged with the development of advanced medical countermeasures to respond to 21st century health security risks. We have funding to develop and clinically evaluate a pandemic flu vaccine with the potential to be stockpiled, using our samRNA technology. Doses should be small, which means you can stockpile a large amount of doses in a small footprint that can be deployed quickly if there is an outbreak. COVID-19 has taught us that pandemics are real and that we need to be prepared – unless we want another multi-trillion dollar mistake and global disaster on our hands. What other lessons must we take away from the COVID-19 pandemic? Scientists warned of a SARS-CoV pandemic back in 2015 – and at that time, a SARS-based vaccine was not developed. This was a lesson for us all and we must take warnings from virus surveillance committees more seriously and be more prepared in the future. If we have stockpiles and plans in place, we can squash these outbreaks in their infancy, before they get out of control and become a global pandemic, with all the associated loss of life and disruption to global infrastructure we saw in 2020. If the COVID-19 pandemic taught us anything, there is a high price to pay for lack of preparation.What is the future potential of mRNA? Vaccines are only scratching the surface of how disruptive this technology can be in the pharmaceutical industry. It has the potential for use in cancer vaccines and other therapeutics. The lion’s share of currently approved drugs deal with the downstream symptoms of the disease. Whether it is pain or inflammation, swelling, hardening of arteries, or cancers – all of these stem from a genetic precursor. DNA is rarely perfect – and dysfunctional or missing elements can lead to disease. The existing therapies work to suppress symptoms, mRNA can go right to the source. If we can go into the body and replace what’s missing or broken in a targeted fashion at the cellular level, then we can potentially normalize the life of a person living with a debilitating disease. Aside from our work on COVID-19 and influenza, we have a lot of exciting mRNA therapeutics in our pipeline. For example, we are working on a liver disease called ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD), where patients have a missing or altered protein function that disrupts the urea cycle. The disease causes ammonia levels to rise in the blood, which can cross the blood-brain barrier and damage neurological tissue. OTCD can cause seizures, coma, and death in untreated patients, there is currently no cure for OTCD. mRNA encased in lipid nanoparticles, injected intravenously, could help restore normal urea function. Our candidate treatment for OTCD is LUNAR-OTC and it is currently in phase II trials. If successful, it would use Arcturus’ mRNA technology to replace the missing liver enzyme inside the patient’s own liver cells, restoring liver function and allowing patients to live a normal life. We expect more data later in 2023.We are also exploring the potential of inhaled therapeutics for the lungs. There are many lung diseases caused by missing proteins, such as cystic fibrosis, which is one area we think mRNA could help. Our candidate here, ARCT-032, received approval at the end of January 2023 to proceed into a first-in-human study in New Zealand. Our preclinical data have shown robust expression and functional restoration of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane gene in human bronchial epithelial cells from donors with cystic fibrosis, and we are very excited to see the first results from trials in human patients. If successful, this therapy could revolutionize the treatment of cystic fibrosis, allowing patients, most of whom are children, to lead a normal life instead of living with a daily routine of physiotherapy and medications simply to manage their symptoms.The scope and breadth of human disease that is addressable with therapeutic mRNA is vast – and with everything Arcturus has in development, 2023 is going to be a very exciting year.

(Ben Nelms/CBC, Heiko Kiera/Shutterstock)Social SharingExperts are advising British Columbians, and pet owners in particular, to take precautions after a recent case where several skunks died of avian flu in Metro Vancouver.On Monday, the province said eight skunks in Vancouver and nearby Richmond had died, likely after scavenging dead wild birds, and they all tested positive for the H5N1 avian influenza virus. They later confirmed the virus was the cause of the animals' deaths.The deaths of the skunks are part of an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian flu (HPAI) that has been affecting North America since last year, with thousands of birds culled in B.C. and significant impacts to the poultry industry.As wild birds arrive in B.C. by the thousands for the annual spring migration, it's leading to experts advising the public to be aware of the threat avian flu presents, and to calls for more robust surveillance of HPAI across the province.8 dead skunks found in Vancouver and Richmond test positive for avian fluBird baths, feeders should be removed to stop spread of avian flu: B.C. SPCA"The good news is that, actually, for cats and dogs, the risk of highly pathogenic avian influenza is actually quite low," said Hannah Weitzenfeld, the senior manager of animal health at the B.C. SPCA."We do want you to keep exercising your dogs and going out."Weitzenfeld added, however, that pets should be kept away from water sources where birds have congregated, as well as bird seed on the ground."The avian influenza virus, it can persist in the environment for a number of days — we don't know exactly how many days," she said. "If we are seeing bird droppings, then stay away from those." While Weitzenfeld says she isn't aware of many cases of avian flu spreading from mammal to mammal, researchers looking into an outbreak at a European mink farm said the virus could have spread through the thousands of the animals there.However, officials have said the risk to humans is very low at this time. Weitzenfeld says the case of skunks dying of avian flu underscores general advice for pet owners — limit all interactions with wildlife."We definitely want to keep our pets away, both for the sake of our pets and also for the sake of the wildlife, from a safety and a health perspective," she said.A sign near Brockton Oval in Vancouver's Stanley Park advising people not to feed wild animals in the area.

(Chad Pawson/CBC)Weitzenfeld also says British Columbians should consider taking down their bird feeders, because they provide an opportunity for wild birds to congregate and spread the virus.The B.C.

Now avian flu is threatening almost an entire industrySecond OpinionHow deadly bird flu sparked explosive outbreaks in 2022 — and why it matters for global healthProfessor asks for more surveillancePeter Arcese, who teaches at the University of B.C.'s forestry department, said COVID-19 has taught us that viruses can linger for a long time, and that proper hygiene is important when dealing with potentially infected materials.Arcese, who has previously worked with wild bird populations, says the current avian flu outbreak is hard to get under control, given it is largely spread by wild birds and not domesticated poultry.Snow Geese are pictured at Garry Point Park in Richmond last year. They are an example of birds that migrate to the province every year. (Ben Nelms/CBC)He says that means a simple cull is unlikely, given the thousands of wild birds that visit B.C. every spring. The province is at the heart of the Western flyway — one of the major migratory paths for birds across the globe."I think that's why surveillance programs and monitoring — to just try and understand the prevalence and number of varieties or strains out there — is probably an initial first step that would be prudent to take," he told CBC News."These [novel pathogen outbreaks] are likely to become more common."Theresa Burns, B.C.'s chief veterinarian, speaks at a news conference on Thursday. Agriculture Minister Pam Alexis is behind her, wearing blue. (Justine Boulin/CBC)Theresa Burns, the province's chief veterinarian, said it's likely avian flu will remain with B.C. residents into the fall this year. There are still restrictions in place across the province on events like bird auctions and poultry swaps.The province recently committed $5 million to help farmers with animal diseases, which it says will help develop new disease control plans and research biosecurity measures.Agriculture Minister Pam Alexis told a news conference that funding will start rolling out to farmers by the end of March.ABOUT THE AUTHORAkshay KulkarniJournalistAkshay Kulkarni is a journalist who has worked at CBC British Columbia since 2021.

This was particularly the case for residents aged less than 12 years and those aged 50 years or above, it added.Children are now able to attend school mask-free.

Strict personal, hand and environmental hygiene should also be observed at all times.”Health authorities explained that immunity against influenza in the city might be “relatively weaker” compared with previous years, as the infections had been at low levels over the past three years.The CHP said it had been closely monitoring the local flu situation. Its laboratory, and those of the Hospital Authority, recorded a slight increase in the weekly percentage of seasonal influenza virus detection.AdvertisementAdvertisementMom shares warning after son's legs amputated following strep, influenza A infections - Good Morning America Open menuVideoShopCultureFamilyWellnessFoodLivingStyleTravelNewsBook ClubGMA3: WYNTKNewsletterPrivacy PolicyYour US State Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsTerms of UseDo Not Sell My InfoContact Us© 2024 ABC NewsSearchWellnessMom shares warning after son's legs amputated following strep, influenza A infections1:25CDC warns invasive Strep A is on the rise in USCourtesy of Michele StevensonByYi-Jin YuMarch 23, 2023, 9:05 PMA Michigan mom is warning other parents to pay attention to their kids and take action if they seem unwell after her son developed strep A and influenza A infections in late December and had to get a double amputation earlier this month.Michele Stevenson of Grand Blanc, Michigan, told "Good Morning America" her son Kaden, 7, started to get sick right before Christmas but she didn't think it was anything serious. She said he told her he felt tired and she thought he possibly had a stomach bug or a cold and let him rest. But after about four days, Kaden didn't seem to be getting any better -- instead, he seemed to be getting progressively worse."I'm thinking maybe he might have the flu just because of the pain he kept talking about. So I'm thinking it might be just body aches or something like that. But by the time I got to him, I couldn't put his shoes on, I couldn't put his coat on, he was in that much pain," Stevenson recalled.Editor’s PicksFamily speaks out after boy dies after injuring his ankle on a treadmillFeb 20, 2023US children's hospitals are tracking increases in severe strep infectionsDec 16, 2022Boy born with rare condition takes 1st steps with prosthetic legAug 15, 2022Michele Stevenson said her son Kaden is usually "extremely active."

His right leg was swollen. He had a rash all over his body. His eyes look puffy to me and it seemed like that all happened within a short period of time."Stevenson said she took Kaden to Hurley Children's Hospital in Flint, but shortly thereafter, doctors told her they needed to transfer Kaden for higher-level care."The ER doctor sat down in front of me and gave me the most serious look I've ever seen a doctor give me and said, 'Your son is really sick,'" Stevenson recounted. "By the next day, they were telling us that they were about to transfer us to another hospital that Kaden needed a pediatric orthopedic surgeon … but I knew it was really serious the moment they said, 'It's going to be in a matter of minutes.' They were just waiting on the helicopter to arrive."After Kaden developed both influenza A and strep infections, he was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit for treatment. Kaden was treated at both Hurley Children's Hospital in Flint, Michigan and then at Helen DeVos Children's Hospital in Grand Rapids, Michigan.Courtesy of Michele StevensonOfficials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention renewed their December warning about invasive strep A Wednesday, noting that at least five children in Illinois have reportedly died following infections this year. The season for invasive strep A tends to run between December through April and this type of bacterial infection can be more dangerous because it can impact multiple parts of the body, such as a person's blood, bones or lungs.Related ArticlesMORE: Invasive group A strep on the rise in parts of the US: What to knowIn addition, although the number of influenza cases have been relatively low across the U.S., multiple strains of the influenza A virus have been in circulation, according to data from the CDC.Michele Stevenson and her son Kaden.

"One little boy didn't make it. I'm hearing this family sad and crying and saying goodbye to their son, and my son's here still fighting for his life.

Anderson The Mask of Ignorance Recent responses to the Cochrane review suggest that there may be no cure for maskaholics. / Health Care March 21, 2023 / Share / Eye on the News / Health Care Mar 21 2023 / Share “Wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference.” Such was the verdict of a recent Cochrane review, a systematic assessment of all medical research on masks. How much should one trust this overarching study? Medical journals say that Cochrane reviews are “recognized worldwide as the highest standard in evidence-based healthcare,” are the “best single source of highest-quality systematic reviews,” and are “regarded as the final word in the medical debate on a topic.” One adds, “The main reason is that Cochrane reviews follow a common and specific methodology to limit bias.” If only the same could be said about the public-health officials at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Specifically, Cochrane found, “Wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference to the outcome of influenza-like illness (ILI)/COVID-19 like illness”—or “to the outcome of laboratory-confirmed influenza/SARS-CoV-2”—“compared to not wearing masks.” Moreover, “The use of a N95/P2 respirators compared to medical/surgical masks probably makes little or no difference for the outcome . . . of laboratory-confirmed influenza infection.” Each of these claims was made with “moderate certainty,” the second highest of four certainty classifications. (“Moderate certainty” means that “the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect.”) The mask advocates’ grasping-at-straws response to this review has been that Cochrane doesn’t know what it’s doing (despite its “worldwide” reputation for providing “the highest standard” of medical research). Or they say that Cochrane produced a fine study, but people didn’t read it correctly. Or randomized controlled trials aren’t to be trusted when it comes to masks (RCTs are universally considered the gold standard in medical research). Or we need more and better RCTs on masks, though 16 have already been conducted on surgical or cloth masks, none of which has provided compelling evidence that they work. The mask advocates’ refusal to recognize that medical science does not support their steadfast belief is truly remarkable. Clearly, something more is going on here than a genuine debate about which health-care measures work. Part of it, perhaps, is that progressives don’t like it when they can’t control something. Masks let them feel as if they can control the virus—and other people, to boot, the next best thing to controlling the virus. There’s also the matter of identity. For some, a mask conveys quasi-religious symbolism—we believe in Health—and serves as a sort of spiritual symbol, a totem. No one wants to be told that their totem is powerless. Evidence suggesting masks’ ineffectiveness has remained relatively constant over time. In addition to the individual RCTs conducted across the years, which I discussed in detail in a 2021 City Journal essay reviewing the evidence, Cochrane published a review on November 20, 2020, that closely resembles its January 2023 review. Cochrane’s earlier review found that wearing a mask “probably makes little or no difference to the outcome of laboratory-confirmed influenza . . . compared to not wearing” a mask, and that using an N95 “compared to” a surgical mask “probably makes little or no difference for the . . . outcome of laboratory-confirmed influenza infection.” In fact, the 2023 review repeats all of this language verbatim. Unlike the 2023 Cochrane review, however, the 2020 review didn’t make much of a splash. This may have been by design. Tom Jefferson, the lead author of both studies, says that Cochrane delayed the release of the 2020 study; it “held it up for 7 months.” If not for that delay, the review would have appeared just a few weeks after the CDC profoundly reversed its masking guidance—from don’t wear masks to do wear masks—on April 3, 2020, citing no meaningful new evidence on which to base that change. It’s certainly believable that Cochrane didn’t want to look like it was contradicting the CDC at that pivotal time. The Australian investigative journalist Maryanne Demasi, who interviewed Jefferson, asked, “Are you suggesting that Cochrane was pro-mask, and that your review contradicted the narrative . . . ?” Jefferson replied, “Yes, I think that is what was going on.” He noted that Cochrane wrote a pro-mask editorial to accompany the study’s eventual 2020 release. “Waiting for strong evidence is a recipe for paralysis,” the editorial stated. Such a message, Jefferson observes, is “a complete subversion of the ‘precautionary principle’ which states that you should do nothing unless you have reasonable evidence that benefits outweigh the harms.” Now the Cochrane executives are at it again. Facing criticism from influential mask advocates, Karla Soares-Weiser, editor-in-chief of the Cochrane Library, issued a statement on March 10—about a month and a half after the 2023 review’s release—saying that “the review is not able to address the question of whether mask-wearing itself reduces people’s risk of contracting or spreading respiratory viruses.” This, of course, is exactly what the review addressed, and it concluded, with “moderate certainty,” that mask-wearing “probably makes little or no difference” in preventing the spread of viruses. The most noteworthy thing about the 2023 Cochrane review is that it provides further confirmation that the two RCTs that took place after the release of the 2020 Cochrane study—one in Denmark and the other in Bangladesh—didn’t move the needle in favor of masks. In fact, the needle moved in the opposite direction: Cochrane now says that masks “probably” (2023), as opposed to “may” (2020), make “little or no difference to the outcome of influenza-like illness.” (This is in addition to Cochrane’s having previously reported that masks “probably” make “little or no difference to the outcome of laboratory-confirmed influenza.”) And in 2023, Cochrane explicitly added “COVID-19” and “SARS-CoV-2” to the list of things that masks apparently don’t prevent—and could even increase—the spread of. How could masks increase the spread of viruses? Cochrane suggests the possibilities of “self-contamination of the mask by hands” and “saturation of masks with saliva from extended use (promoting virus survival in proteinaceous material).” In March 2020, then-surgeon general Jerome Adams said, “Folks who don’t know how to wear [masks] properly tend to touch their faces a lot and actually can increase the spread of coronavirus.” The authors of one RCT write, “The virus may survive on the surface of the facemasks” and “transfer pathogen from the mask to the bare hands of the wearer.” As for double-masking, the same authors write, “Observations during SARS suggested double-masking . . . increased the risk of infection because of moisture, liquid diffusion and pathogen retention.” In other words, masks are often moist, frequently dirty, and sometimes virus ridden. Having one stuck to your face could increase the spread of viruses—especially if you touch your mask, or if your young children touch theirs. The mask zealots, however, remain unmoved. In an article at Health.com responding to the Cochrane review, Sarah Sloat essentially quotes three evidence-denying doctors and rests her case. One declares that masks “are an additional layer of protection” (RCTs be damned). Another asserts, “If you are putting on a mask, you are doing a great job of protecting yourself.” A third opines (with a striking lack of self-awareness), “At the end of the day, people will do what they want, and science is not going to move some people one way or the other.” He then proclaims, “But a mask does give you a big bang for the buck, and not just for COVID-19.” In Vox, Kelsey Piper complains that the Cochrane review includes studies involving other viruses at other times, rather than just studies focused on Covid during the pandemic. She ignores how the inclusion of the two Covid RCTs resulted in Cochrane’s weighing in more strongly against masks’ effectiveness, as one of those RCTs (the one from Denmark) found no statistically significant difference between infection rates in its mask and non-mask groups, and the other (from Bangladesh) found very little difference and claimed that it was significant only because of myriad methodological flaws, which I detailed in a City Journal essay last summer. Piper, however, praises the highly problematic Bangladesh study as “finding very solid evidence,” while the Cochrane review is somewhat “scientifically irresponsible” and really “quite bad meta-analysis.” Likewise, Lucky Tran, writing for the Guardian, criticizes the Cochrane review because it includes other viruses in addition to Covid and because it evaluates masks’ effectiveness as they are actually worn, rather than trying to guess how effective masks might be if people wore them as diligently as public-health officials would like. Tran calls the Cochrane review part of “the avalanche of misinformation” and proclaims, “Masks are magnificent.” He adds that masks “are a visible symbol that the pandemic is ongoing”—another apparent virtue. Finally, New York Times columnist Zeynep Tufekci writes, without substantiation: “So the evidence is relatively straightforward: Consistently wearing a mask, preferably a high-quality, well-fitting one, provides protection against the coronavirus.” She dismisses the Cochrane review and asserts that the Danish study during Covid “found that masks helped.” This is false. The authors of that study plainly stated that “no statistically significant difference in SARS-CoV-2 incidence was observed” between the study’s mask group and its non-mask control group. Other mask advocates claim that the problem isn’t with the Cochrane study at all. Instead, they suggest a deeper, esoteric meaning behind what it plainly says: “Wearing masks in the community probably makes little or no difference.” The Los Angeles Times published a column entitled, “COVID deniers claim a new study says mask mandates don’t work. They should try reading it.” A nurse wrote a letter in response asserting, “I have seen with my own eyes how masks protect people from acquisition and transmission of COVID-19.” People generally can’t see viruses with the naked eye, so this is an impressive claim. Bret Stephens wrote a column in the New York Times entitled, “The Mask Mandates Did Nothing. Will Any Lessons Be Learned?” Times readers’ favorite of the 3,773 comments responding to the article claims that Stephens misrepresents the study, which the reader suggests yielded essentially no information. Their second-favorite comment blames people for not being diligent enough in their mask-wearing and then asks, “Notice how surgeries are still masked environments?” Surgical masks were designed to keep medical personnel from inadvertently infecting patients’ open wounds. Such masks were not designed to reduce the spread of viruses. As for N95s, they were designed to protect workers from breathing in dust, fumes, or smoke. To the extent that they were worn in hospitals pre-Covid, it was primarily to help prevent the spread of tuberculosis bacteria, not to protect against viruses. According to an article on the NIH website, published in the less-politicized, pre-Covid days, “Viruses are tiny, ranging in size from about 20 to 400 nanometers in diameter. . . . Billions can fit on the head of a pin.” More than 1,000 can generally fit on the period at the end of a sentence, which is roughly “350,000 nanometers, in diameter.” In comparison, “Bacteria are 10 to 100 times larger than viruses” and “are usually measured in microns” (with one micron equaling 1,000 nanometers, the usual measure for viruses). It should be greatly disturbing, in light of the evidence, that so many hospitals and doctor’s offices continue to force patients to wear masks. It should make one wonder how many other times medical personnel don’t follow the medical studies on which they supposedly rely. Yet, New York Times readers aren’t disturbed at all but take comfort in mask mandates. Among the readers’ ten favorite comments was one that says, “The [Cochrane] findings are basically nonsense. Common sense prevails here. . . . I was in a hospital today. Everyone has to wear a mask.” In his recent City Journal piece on the 2023 Cochrane review, John Tierney asks, “Can anything persuade the maskaholics in the public-health establishment and the public to give up their obsession?” The answer, plainly, is no. Their faith transcends reason. Jeffrey H. Anderson is president of the American Main Street Initiative, a think tank for everyday Americans.

Its head lies in the sand, and a small tide pool has formed around it. Its shoulder blades jut out and its coffee and beige pelt hangs loosely on protruding vertebrae that taper down to its long tail flippers.But the young male sea lion is still alive. Its round wet eyes blink and occasionally it tries to move, rolling over or lifting its head, as the flooding tide inches it up the beach in Chepeconde, about 75 miles south of Peru’s coastal capital, Lima.“Looking at the state he’s in, you can see that his ribs are showing, this sea lion may have been like this for 10 days, perhaps up to half a month,” says Pilar Ayala, a biologist with Peru’s wildlife service Serfor, dressed in face mask and white hazmat suit.View image in fullscreenThe dying South American sea lion on the beach at Chepeconde, Peru. The young male was showing symptoms of avian influenza. Photograph: Dan Collyns“He has not been able to get food. This, added to the weakness from the disease, has caused his condition to worsen and he can no longer even move around. He’s stranded on this beach,” says Ayala, part of a team of wildlife specialists who have been spending their days registering and taking samples from dead and dying animals along Peru’s 1,850-mile Pacific coastline.The young male has all the symptoms of the H5N1 variant of avian influenza which is ravaging the country’s population of about 105,000 South American sea lions (Otaria flavescens). This month, Peru’s national parks service, Sernanp, recorded the deaths of 3,487 sea lions, 3.29% of the total number, as well as five far less common fur seals ( Arctocephalus australis), in seven protected areas along the coast. But scientists estimate the true number of bird flu deaths is probably much higher.Approaching the Isla San Gallán by boat – a two-hour trip from the Paracas national reserve – you can hear the colony of sea lions before it is possible to make out the individuals in the dark brown mass lining the strand. A cacophony of roaring and bleating; from the huge maned bulls, each guarding a harem of females, to the pups calling out for their mothers among the fiercely territorial family groups.Curious juveniles swim out in groups to investigate our boat, raising their long necks out of the water before disappearing in a splash. On closer inspection, there are several corpses being fed on by turkey vultures and gulls. While deaths are normal in large colonies and not necessarily a sign of disease, a drone flight confirmed the presence of dozens more corpses littering the beach. In the overcrowded colony, mixed with seabirds, it is easy to see the potential for infectious disease to spread.View image in fullscreenThe South America sea lion colony on the Isla San Gallán in the Paracas national reserve in Peru. It is one of the largest sea lion colonies on the continent. Photograph: Dan CollynsThe outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza subtype A, the (HPAI) H5N1 variant, was first detected in Peruvian pelicans on the northern coast in November but soon spread south, killing Peruvian boobies, sanderlings and Guanay cormorants. Sernanp has counted at least 63,000 dead sea birds in national parks and protected guano islands, many more can be seen strewn along the country’s coastline, home to one of the world’s richest fisheries. Infected birds wobble along public beaches unafraid of the crowds of beachgoers enjoying the summer sunshine.“The fact that the virus is not only in birds but also in mammals means it is potentially risky for the public,” says Ayala. “It is currently being seen in different species of mammals, so we must take precautions in order to avoid another pandemic for humans.”About 100 metres from the dying sea lion, Ayala finds the corpse of an endangered marine otter (lontra felina). Cases of avian flu in otters, foxes and seals have been recorded in other countries, including the UK.“If the sample from this otter is positive, it would be the first case of influenza in this species [in Peru],” she says. Later, test results prove inconclusive because the animal has been dead for too long.The mass die-off of sea lions suggests that there might be mammal-to-mammal transmission, though we cannot confirm thatMariana LeguiaWhile the virus has mainly infected sea lions, a dead dolphin has also tested positive, and, in February, a lion died from the virus in a zoo in Huancayo, a city in the Andes. Just weeks later, Peru’s agricultural health service, Senasa, announced a health emergency until the end of the year; prohibiting the unauthorised movement of live poultry, and banning cockfights.Scientists are worried not just that the virus has jumped from birds to mammals but that mammal-to-mammal transmission might be a possibility.“The mass die-off of sea lions suggests that there might be mammal-to-mammal transmission, though we cannot confirm that,” says Mariana Leguia, who runs the Genomics Laboratory at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru in Lima, which has been analysing samples gathered along the country’s coast since November. “Obviously, that is concerning because this is a virus with pathogenic potential for humans.”View image in fullscreenTesting samples in the lab for avian influenza. Photograph: Dan CollynsIn February, the World Health Organization warned of a possible bird flu pandemic after the past year and a half constituted the world’s deadliest outbreak of the disease in domestic and wild birds.Leguia and her team raced to publish a scientific paper listing the genome sequences of tested bird flu samples. The virus has spread to 15 countries in the Americas but Peru has seen the biggest mortality in mammals.Death of thousands of wild birds from avian flu is ‘new Silent Spring’Read moreAs the virus tears through Peru’s coastal species, conservationists worry about the impact on endangered marine otters and threatened Humboldt penguins and Andean condors, the last of which scavenge dead sea lions.Peru’s biodiversity as well as its geography – sitting squarely in the middle of South America – make it vulnerable and also a potential threat as migratory birds that bring the virus from the north fly back northward again, possibly carrying a mutated variant.“There is the possibility of a massive number of different species acquiring the virus and it mutating in the process,” warns Leguia.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and featuresExplore more on these topicsBirdsThe age of extinctionBird fluHealthPeruWorld Health OrganizationfeaturesShareReuse this contentMost viewedMost viewedEnvironmentClimate crisisWildlifeEnergyPollutionNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInXNewslettersAdvertise with usSearch UK jobsBack to top© 2024 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

To be prepared for potential pandemics, broadly effective and safe vaccines are crucial. Recombinant measles virus (MeV) encoding antigens of foreign pathogens constitutes a promising vector platform to generate novel vaccines. To characterize the efficacy of H7N9 antigens in a prototypic vaccine platform technology, we generated MeVs encoding either neuraminidase (N9) or hemagglutinin (H7). Moraten vaccine strain-derived vaccine candidates were rescued; they replicated with efficiency comparable to that of the measles vaccine, robustly expressed H7 and N9, and were genetically stable over 10 passages. Immunization of MeV-susceptible mice triggered the production of antibodies against H7 and N9, including hemagglutination-inhibiting and neutralizing antibodies induced by MVvac2-H7(P) and neuraminidase-inhibiting antibodies by MVvac2-N9(P). Vaccinated mice also developed long-lasting H7- and N9-specific T cells. Both MVvac2-H7(P) and MVvac2-N9(P)-vaccinated mice were protected from lethal H7N9 challenge.

Different approaches using inactivated trivalent vaccines (TIV), including inactivated whole virus, split and subunit vaccines, or live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) have already been developed and authorized2. Due to the high mutation rate of influenza viruses and reassortment of genomic segments yielding new, altered seasonal or even novel pandemic influenza strains, new vaccines have to be produced annually3. The production of these vaccines typically rely on the amplification of live influenza virus in embryonated chicken eggs3,4, which have limited production capacity4. These limits have been responsible for vaccine shortages under special circumstances, such as the pandemics declared in June 2009 for H1N15, when the delayed availability of vaccines highlighted that classical influenza vaccine production strategies may not be fast enough to prevent the pandemic spread of a novel influenza virus3. A solution for this issue may be found in efficient and fast vaccine platform technologies with the opportunity to easily exchange the critical antigens of newly emerged or genetically drifted influenza strains3,4.A novel H7N9 avian influenza A virus (IAV) lineage may be a challenge of this kind. Since its emergence in 20136, 39% of more than 1500 H7N9-infected patients have succumbed to zoonotic infection with a few human-to-human transmissions7. Although the infectivity of this virus for humans is still quite low, genetic changes facilitating an adaption to mammalian receptors8 and an efficient spread between ferrets by contact9,10 reveal an adaption to mammalian hosts11,12 and indicate that an enhanced human-to-human transmission is possible by genetic drift of the virus. This potential for pandemic mandates the development of viable alternative technologies in case of rapid, world-wide spread as observed during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. First and still most authorized COVID-19 vaccines of the Western World rely on vaccine platform technologies (i.e. mRNA vaccines Comirnaty and Spikevax, AdV-derived vaccines Vaxzevria and Jcovden vs. protein vaccines Nuvaxovid and VidPrevtyn Beta, inactivated virus COVID19 vaccine Valneva13,14) that allow rapid adaption to new challenges. However, to generate a successful vaccine on the basis of a platform technology, understanding of the protective efficacy of selected antigens against variants of pathogen subtypes is crucial.Among promising vaccine platform candidates are vaccine strain-derived, replicating recombinant measles virus (MeV) vaccines. MeV vaccine strains are strongly immunogenic and reveal an excellent safety record evidenced with billions of doses being used for measles immunization since 196315,16. A single immunization results in strong humoral as well as cellular immune responses in 85% of vaccinees, which probably provides life-long protection15,17. To reach the high level of coverage for protective herd-immunity, a two-dose immunization schedule is recommended, nevertheless18. Moreover, the manufacturing of measles vaccines is well established19 on industrial scale. Reverse genetics systems for recombinant MeV have been generated, which allow the insertion of extra gene segments of up to 6 kb into recombinant MeV19,20. Thereby, a wide range of MeV-derived vaccines targeting e.g. HBV21, HIV22, Chikungunya virus (CHIKV)23, Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV)24, Zika virus (ZIKV)25 or lately SARS-CoV-226,27 have been generated by expressing respective antigens mediating protection. Immunization of MeV-susceptible receptor-transgenic, type I interferon receptor-deficient IFNAR−/−-CD46Ge mice28 or non-human primates22 induced significant immune responses against the inserted antigens21,22,23,24 even in animals with pre-formed anti-measles immunity22,23. These immune responses were shown to be protective against e.g. CHIKV23, MERS-CoV24 and ZIKV25. Furthermore, MV-CHIKV has successfully completed phase I and phase II clinical trials, where it efficiently induced immune responses against CHIKV irrespective of pre-existing α-MeV antibodies29,30. Therefore, recombinant MeV can be regarded as one of the promising vector platform technologies besides e.g. mRNA or adenoviral vector-derived systems to generate pandemic vaccines against emerging infections. Therefore, MeV-derived vaccine candidates can inherently be utilized to qualify critical parameters of respective vaccine vectors such as choice and format of foreign antigens to become expressed in the pre-pandemic setting.This study aimed to characterize pre-pandemic MeV-derived model vaccines against H7N9 and to compare the protective efficacy of immune responses against hemagglutinin (H7) and neuraminidase (N9) induced by these vaccines. To analyze the MeV-derived vaccines for protection against influenza infections, we generated MeVs expressing the full-length H7 or N9 of IAV subtype H7N9. These antigens are the main components of traditional split vaccines. Antibodies directed against these glycoproteins can inhibit their critical biological functions, i.e. receptor-binding and membrane fusion or enzymatic cleavage of sialic acids, and thus prevent viral replication31,32 and protect from viral pathology8,33,34,35,36. For this purpose, we cloned H7- or N9-encoding ORFs of A/Shanghai/2/2013 (H7N9) virus into the respective additional transcription units (ATU) following the P (post P) or the H gene cassette (post H) of the MeV Moraten vaccine strain genome (MVvac2). Both post P (MVvac2-H7(P); MVvac2-N9(P)) or post H (MVvac2-H7(H); MVvac2-N9(H)) positions were tested to take advantage of the transcriptional gradient in MeV genomes. The vaccine candidates were rescued and expressed the inserted antigens without impact on the recombinant virus replication. Immunization of IFNAR−/−-CD46Ge mice induced high titers of antibodies and antigen-specific T cells. Antibodies induced by immunization with MV-H7(P) had hemagglutination-inhibiting as well as virus-neutralizing capacity, whereas antibodies induced by both H7- and N9-encoding vaccines inhibited neuraminidase activity when using H7N9-presenting virus particles as substrates. Moreover, cellular immune responses were still detectable more than two years after vaccination of juvenile mice at the end of their natural life-span. Finally, immunization with either H7 or N9 encoding candidate vaccines protected IFNAR−/−-CD46Ge mice from lethal H7N9 challenge. Our data thereby demonstrate on the basis of MeV as an efficient vaccine platform that both H7 and N9 are valuable antigen structures also in this technology to target potentially pandemic, highly pathogenic influenza virus subtypes.ResultsGeneration of recombinant vaccine-strain MeV expressing H7 or N9 of IAV H7N9Since the envelope glycoproteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase are major protective antigens of IAV34,36, both antigens were chosen to be expressed by recombinant MVvac2 to analyze measles virus platform-based vaccine candidates against IAV H7N9. For this purpose, full-length ORFs encoding hemagglutinin subtype H7 and neuraminidase subtype N9 were each cloned into two different additional transcription units (ATUs) either after the P (post P) or after the H (post H) gene cassettes of MVvac2 (Fig. 1a). This strategy takes advantage of the MeV transcription gradient37 to generate recombinant MeV which are high or dampened in the transcription of foreign antigens´ mRNA. Clones of all recombinant viruses, i.e. MVvac2-H7(P), MVvac2-H7(H), MVvac2-N9(P), and MVvac2-N9(H), were rescued and passaged until passage 10 (P10) with titers up to 1.2 × 108 TCID50/ml for MVvac2-H7(P), 1.9 × 108 TCID50/ml for MVvac2-H7(H), 6.9 × 107 TCID50/ml for MVvac2-N9(P) and 5.9 × 107 TCID50/ml for MVvac2-N9(H). The genomic integrity of the additional transgene expression cassettes was demonstrated after short- (P3) (Supplementary Fig. 1) or long-term passage (P10) by sequencing of respective regions in the vaccine genomes. The insertion of the extra genetic elements did not significantly affect viral growth in Vero cells compared to control viruses expressing GFP in the respective ATUs (Fig. 1b). The expression of H7 (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 2) was demonstrated by Western Blot analysis, while the enzymatic activity of the expressed N9 (Fig. 1d) was demonstrated in vaccine virus-infected cells using the neuraminidase substrate MUNANA. As expected, both antigens were expressed about two-fold more efficiently after insertion into the post P than into the post H ATU. Thus, the generation of MVvac2-derived vaccines expressing the hemagglutinin or neuraminidase of IAV H7N9 was achieved yielding genetically stable, high-titer vaccines without replication deficiencies and with significant expression of the additional antigens. This indicates a good compatibility of the chosen antigens with vaccine technologies derived from viral vector platforms.Fig. 1: Generation and characterization of MVvac2-H7 and MVvac2-N9.a Schematic depiction of full-length hemagglutinin H7 and neuraminidase N9 antigens (left scheme) expressed by recombinant MVvac2 genomes (right scheme).

Blots were probed using rabbit serum reactive against H7N1 (upper blot) or, after stripping of the membrane, mAb reactive against MV-N (lower blot) and thus were derived from the same experiment.

Error bars indicate SEM.Full size imageMVvac2-H7(P) and MVvac2-N9(P) induce significant humoral immunity in immunized MeV-susceptible miceMVvac2-H7(P) and MVvac2-N9(P) were chosen for immunization experiments due to the stronger expression of the inserted antigens (Fig. 1c, d). For vaccination, MeV-susceptible transgenic IFNAR−/−-CD46GE mice were vaccinated with MVvac2-H7(P), MVvac2-N9(P), medium (OptiMEM) or measles control vaccine (MVvac2-ATU(P)) in a prime-boost set-up using a dose of 1×105 TCID50 of recombinant vaccine virus for each vaccination (Fig. 2a). First, sera collected before (d 0) as well as after the first (d 28) and second immunization (d 49) were analyzed for total H7- or N9-binding antibodies (bAbs) via immune peroxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) (Fig. 2b). For this purpose, MDCK cells infected with recombinant H7N9 A/Shanghai/2/2013-A/PR/8/34, thereby expressing all influenza virus antigens including H7 and N9, were used as targets. While vaccination with MVvac2-H7(P) or MVvac2-N9(P) induced bAbs with mean titers of 4667 ± 1633 or 2535 ± 1631 after prime immunization, respectively, sera of medium or vector control mice did not include antibodies above IPMA detection level. A single mouse vaccinated with MVvac2-N9(P) did not react with any antibodies targeting IVA or MeV, most likely reflecting a general failure of vaccination of this individual animal. Thus, MVvac2-H7(P) induced 1.8-fold higher bAb titers than MVvac2-N9(P) after the prime immunization, but a homologous booster increased bAbs in both cohorts to a comparable titer around 8000.Fig. 2: Induction of H7N9-specific binding and neutralizing antibodies.a Blood of mice vaccinated on days 0 and 28 with indicated viruses was sampled on day 0, 21 and 49. Sera were analyzed for (b) α-H7N9 binding antibodies (bAbs) and (c) H7N9 neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) as well as (d) MeV nAbs. Medium (OptiMEM) or empty measles vaccine (ATU(P)) inoculated mice served as controls. b Total α-H7N9 bAbs were determined as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution staining H7N9-A/PR/8/34 infected cells in IPMA. c, d Virus neutralizing titers (VNT) were calculated as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution completely neutralizing virus infectivity. Dots represent single animals (n = 6); horizontal line represents mean per group. Y-axis starts at detection limit; all mice at detection limit had no detectable VNT. ns, not significant; **, p < 0.01; ****, p < 0.0001 (non-parametric One-way ANOVA).Full size imageNext, we analyzed the virus-neutralizing titers (VNTs) of these antibodies against the recombinant H7N9 A/Shanghai/2/2013-A/PR/8/34, which expresses the H7 and N9 in the backbone of PR8 IAV strain (Fig. 2c). Only the antibodies induced by MVvac2-H7(P), but not those by MVvac2-N9(P) revealed neutralizing capacity. The neutralizing capacity of these Abs were boosted 1.6-fold by the second immunization (from 573 ± 270 to 933 ± 311 VNT). As expected, no nAbs neutralizing recombinant H7N9-PR8 virus were detectable in sera of mock or vector control mice. To control effective immunization, neutralization of MeV by the sera of the immunized mice was quantified, as well (Fig. 2d). As expected, antibodies neutralizing MeV were detectable in all immunized but not in mock control mice or in mice before immunization. High anti-MeV VNTs of 1,867 ± 513 (MVvac2-ATU(P)), 1,067 ± 482 (MVvac2-H7(P)), and 1,281 ± 902 (MVvac2-N9(P)) after the first and 3,307 ± 1640 (MVvac2-ATU(P)), 2,267 ± 1014 (MVvac2-H7(P)), and 1,601 ± 879 (MVvac2-N9(P)) after the second immunization were found, revealing robust induction and boosting of measles immunity in all vaccine groups without significant differences. Interestingly, the single mouse immunized with MVvac2-N9(P) that had no detectable α-influenza nAbs did also not produce any α-MeV nAbs indicating a general failure of vaccination in this animal.The results demonstrate that both MVvac2-H7(P) and MVvac2-N9(P) are potent inducers of humoral immune responses directed against H7 and N9, respectively. However, only MVvac2-H7(P), but not MVvac2-N9(P) induces virus-neutralizing Abs.Antibodies induced by MVvac2-based H7N9 vaccines inhibit biological activities of influenza H7N9 glycoproteinsTo assess the other modes of action besides neutralization of the antibodies which are induced by MVvac2-H7(P) or MVvac2-N9(P) on influenza H7N9 infectivity and spread, we determined hemagglutination as well as neuraminidase inhibition titers (Fig. 3). As expected, sera of mice immunized with MVvac2-H7(P), but not of mock-treated animals or those vaccinated using MVvac2-ATU(P) or MVvac2-N9(P) inhibited hemagglutination of chicken erythrocytes (hemagglutination inhibition, HAI) by H7 incorporated in the envelope of H7N9-PR8 virus particles (Fig. 3a). The HAI titer of 167 ± 82 after the first immunization was 1.4-fold boosted to 240 ± 88 after the second immunization. To analyze whether neuraminidase-activity is inhibited by the humoral immune response, we performed an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA)38. Here, NA-inhibition titers in 5 out of 6 mice vaccinated with MVvac2-N9(P), and rather unexpectedly in 3 out of 5 mice vaccinated with MVvac2-H7(P) were above 640 (50% endpoint titer) when testing N9 incorporated into H7N9-PR8 particles (Fig. 3b).Fig. 3: Inhibition of hemagglutination and neuraminidase activity by sera of vaccinated mice. Hemagglutination and neuraminidase inhibition activity of serum antibodies were assayed on days 0, 28, and 49 after immunization as indicated in Fig. 2a. a Hemagglutination inhibiting titers (HAI titers) were calculated as the highest serum dilution abolishing the hemagglutination activity of H7N9-A/PR/8/34. b Neuraminidase inhibition was calculated as the 50% NA inhibitory concentration (IC50) after incubation of H7N9-A/PR/8/34 with mice sera in enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). Dots represent single animals (n = 6); horizontal line represents mean per group. Y-axis starts at detection limit; all mice at detection limit had no detectable titers. ****, p < 0.0001 (non-parametric One-way ANOVA).Full size imageThese data indicate that MVvac2-H7(P)- or MVvac2-N9(P)-induced antibodies are not only able to bind to H7N9 glycoproteins, but are also able to inhibit their receptor-binding and enzymatic activities and thus influenza virus pathogenicity.Antigen-specific cellular anti-influenza immune responses in animals vaccinated with MeV-derived vaccinesSince a strong correlation between T cell responses and influenza clearance has been observed in various human trials39,40,41 and in a mouse model42, we analyzed the ability of MVvac2-H7(P) or MVvac2-N9(P) to induce cellular immunity against H7N9. The reactivity of splenocytes of the vaccinated mice was determined by IFN-γ ELISpot after re-stimulation with H7- or N9-presenting syngenic dendritic cell (DC) clones four days after the booster immunization. For this purpose, transgenic DC clones based on the syngenic cell lines JAWSII and DC2.4 were generated by lentiviral transduction with H7- or N9-encoding gene transfer vectors. The activation of splenocytes was measured by IFN-γ ELIspot assay after co-culture of splenocytes with these DC clones or a clone stably expressing MeV-N24 (Fig. 4a, b, Supplementary Fig 3). In addition, splenocytes of all groups were stimulated with the antigen-independent polyclonal stimulator Concanavalin A (ConA) to test the general reactivity of the samples and with MeV-bulk antigens to control anti-MeV reactivity (in addition to the MeV N-expressing DC clone). All mice showed similar numbers of IFN-γ secreting cells upon ConA treatment indicating that splenocytes of all animals were reactive (Fig. 4c). Additionally, no significant difference in IFN-γ secreting cells could be observed after re-stimulation with JAWSII-MV-N (Fig. 4a, b) or MeV bulk antigen (Fig. 4c) between splenocytes of mice vaccinated with MVvac2-ATU(P), MVvac2-H7(P), or MVvac2-N9(P). Thus, all mice were similarly susceptible to MeV vaccination. However, a significant 5.7-fold increase (179 ± 70 vs. 32 ± 22) in the number of IFN-γ secreting splenocytes from MVvac2-H7(P)-immunized mice compared to those vaccinated by the vector control MVvac2-ATU(P) was observed upon H7-specific re-stimulation (Fig. 4a). This observation indicates that only MVvac2-H7(P) induced influenza-specific T cells while both vaccine and vector control triggered similarly α-MeV T cells. The latter holds also true for the MVvac2-N9(P) vaccine. However, although the number of IFN-γ secreting cells among splenocytes of MVvac2-N9(P)-vaccinated mice was 1.9-fold higher in comparison to those of MVvac2-ATU(P) vaccinated mice after re-stimulation with N9, this difference was not statistically significant due to large variation within both groups (Fig. 4b). Interestingly, splenocytes of MVvac2-N9(P) vaccinated mice revealed high background activation upon contact with JAWSII cells irrespective of the presented antigen. Replication of these experiments using transgenic DC2.4 cell clones for antigen presentation gave similar results (Supplementary Fig. 3) thus excluding JAWSII-specific experimental artifacts.Fig. 4: Secretion of IFN-γ after antigen-specific re-stimulation of splenocytes.IFN-γ ELISpot analysis of murine splenocytes isolated 4 d after boost immunization. a H7- or (b) N9-specific T cells were detected after co-culture of splenocytes with JAWSII dendritic cell lines transgenic for MeV-N (black columns), H7, or N9 (grey columns). a, b Untransduced cells (NC) or (c) medium (unst.) served as negative controls (white columns). c Splenocytes were stimulated with 10 μg/ml MeV bulk antigens (black columns) or ConA (striped columns) as positive controls.

While our data also indicate cellular immune responses against N9 in respective vaccinated mice, these results lack statistical significance due to comparatively high background reactivity or background stimulation and heterogeneity of the observed reactivity. Thus, both arms of the adaptive immune system are induced by H7- or N9-expressing measles vaccine vectors.Long-term cellular immunity in individual mice after vaccination with MVvac2-H7(P)For one cohort of mice, analysis followed the prime-boost vaccination after over two years of interim time. Three mice vaccinated with MVvac2-H7(P) and two mice vaccinated with MVvac2-N9(P) remained available for the analysis, which were used to determine the longevity of cellular responses by performing IFN-γ ELISpot with their splenocytes as described above. Interestingly, we could detect clear H7-specific responses in two of three analyzed animals (#590, #587) and enhanced reactivity also in the third mouse #592 (Fig. 5a, c). For animals #590 and #587, the number of reactive T cells was even in a similar range compared to the experiments determining cellular responses 4 days post boost vaccination. A single mock control animal from the same experiment did neither show H7- (Fig. 5a) nor MeV-specific responses (Fig. 5a, b), but was still responsive to ConA treatment (Fig. 5b) the latter indicating the preserved reactivity of the splenocytes, in principle. However, the two N9-vaccinated mice did not show N9-specific re-stimulation over the background level (Fig. 5d–f).Fig. 5: Long-term H7N9-specific cellular immunity of aged mice.a–c IFN-γ ELISpot assay after antigen-specific re-stimulation of murine splenocytes isolated 2 years after boost immunization with MVvac2-H7(P) (a–c) or with MVvac2-N9(P) (d–f). Untransduced cells (a, d) or medium (b, e) served as negative controls (white columns). H7- or N9-specific T cells were detected after co-culture of splenocytes with JAWSII dendritic cell lines transgenic for MeV-N (black columns), H7, or N9 (grey colums). Untransduced cells (NC) (a, d) or medium (unst.) (b, e) served as negative controls (white columns) while stimulation with 10 μg/ml MV bulk antigens (black columns) or ConA (striped columns) (b, e) served as positive controls. Results of individual mice are shown.Full size imageAlbeit quite limited in numbers of tested individual animals (due to considerable loss of animals over the long time course of the experiment), these data indicate that in principle geriatric mice may still profit from immunity when vaccinated with MeV-platform-derived vaccines in their youth.Protection of H7 and N9-vaccinated mice against lethal influenza virus challengeIn a final set of experiments, we wanted to test, if and which of the immune responses detected in previous analyses are protective in a challenge experiment of respectively vaccinated animals. The challenge was performed using the available wild-type isolate A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) with H7 and N9 antigenically identical to those of A/Shanghai/2/2013 (H7N9) employed for the generation of the MeV-derived vaccine. To establish an appropriate challenge dose in vivo, the LD50 dose was first determined in the IFNAR−/−-CD46Ge mouse strain susceptible for vaccination with MeV-derived vaccines. For this purpose, naïve mice of this strain were infected intranasally with 10-fold ascending doses of the virus ranging between 102 and 105 pfu (Fig. 6b, c). All mice in the groups infected with the highest infectious doses of 105 and 104 pfu (Fig. 6b) had to be sacrificed 4 to 7 days postinfection due to reaching the 80% weight limit, revealing a dose-dependent effect of weight loss and killing. Both lower infection doses (103 and 102 pfu/animal) resulted in partial survival by 33% (for 103 pfu) and 86% (for 102 pfu). Weight curves (Fig. 6b) correlated well with the used infection dose and survival rates (Fig. 6c). Using a sigmoidal non-linear standard curve model for interpolation of log10 (dose) and death rates resulted in a calculated LD50 value of 2.98 log10 pfu for the used IFNAR−/−-CD46Ge strain. For the following challenge experiments of vaccinated mice, infection doses of 10x LD50, i.e. 104 pfu/mouse, were used.Fig. 6: H7N9 challenge experiments.a Vaccination and challenge scheme used in challenge experiments shown in (d, e). b, c In vivo titration of the 50% lethal dose (LD50) of intranasal H7N9 challenge virus used in IFNAR−/−-CD46Ge mice ranging between 102-105 pfu/mouse. For survival, the weight cutoff of ≥80% of initial body weight was used. d, e H7N9 challenge of vaccinated mice with a determined dose of 10× LD50 (1 × 104 pfu). Error bars indicate SD of means.Full size imageTo analyze the protective capacity of the immune responses which are induced by MVvac2-H7(P) or MVvac2-N9(P), mice were immunized with either vaccine, the control vector MVvac2-ATU(P), or placebo (OptiMEM) as described above. Three weeks after the second immunization, vaccinated mice were challenged. While naïve control animals and the MVvac2-ATU(P) vector control mice had to be sacrificed due to the pathogenesis of H7N9 infection, 100% (6/6) of mice received the H7 vaccine and 83% of mice (5/6) vaccinated with the N9 vaccine were protected. H7-vaccinated mice did not experience any weight drop after challenge, while N9-vaccinated mice fully recovered after 4 days p.i. after an initial slight drop in body weight. One mouse in the N9-vaccine group developed progressive weight loss and therefore had to be sacrificed on day 4 p.i. (Fig. 6d, e). Therefore, vaccines inducing responses against either of the chosen antigens revealed remarkable protection in this uniformly lethal setting.DiscussionIn this study, we aimed at evaluating the performance of two major influenza surface antigens, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, to qualify their usefulness to generate vaccine platform-based vaccine candidates targeting IAV subtype H7N9 in the pre-pandemic setting. For this purpose, we took advantage of recombinant, vaccine strain-derived MeV and successfully generated two genetically stable vaccine prototypes that expressed either H7 or N9 in high amounts without losing characteristic vaccine properties. Both vaccine candidates induced functional antibody responses targeting the characteristic activities of either target protein. Also, considerable antigen-specific cellular immune responses were induced against H7 or N9. The respective immune responses resulted in complete protection of H7-vaccinated animals and protection of 90% of N9-vaccinated animals against lethal influenza infection challenge. Most remarkable was the longevity of H7-specific T cells that were still detected in mice approaching the end of their natural life-span, although they had been vaccinated as juveniles.Such distinct longevity of immunity is well-described for MeV after natural infection that results in life-long protection43. A comparable trend is assumed for the measles vaccine, which is a life-attenuated version of MeV, still closely resembling the high and early immune cell tropism of the parental virus44,45,46,47,48. Parallel to the drastic reduction of circulating MeV in the population due to the WHO measles eradication campaign49, some progressive decrease of protection afforded by the MeV vaccine has been observed over the last two decades50. Although this correlation has put a slight question mark about comparability of measles immunity after infection or vaccination, the stability of measles immunity is anyway extraordinary. Therefore, our data confirm at least for the H7 antigen that also the encoded foreign antigens can profit from these vaccine platform properties of recombinant MeV. Moreover, the activation of both arms of the adaptive immune system is triggered by our live-attenuated vaccine candidates and results in the induction of both functional antibody responses and considerable antigen-specific T cells targeting H7 or N9. These results demonstrate the advantages of this technology. In contrast, adjuvanted proteins as used in the classical split vaccine or inactivated virus approaches are mainly inducing antibody, but are doing less well in boosting of T cell responses51.Such classical approaches to generate influenza vaccines suffer from the high antigenic variability of influenza viruses especially of the hemagglutinin, which requires annual adaptation to forecasted subtypes and serotypes of circulating strains that can be expected to dominate the up-coming influenza season52. While this process is routinely established for the usual fluctuation of antigenic profiles of circulating strains, a potentially up-coming influenza pandemic will force tough decisions on the allocation of limited production resources (usually in embryonated SPF chicken eggs), as has become evident for the H1N1/2009 influenza pandemic53. Until truly broadly protective vaccines covering at least the antigenic profiles of specific subtypes are established, applications of vaccine platform-based technologies such as viral vectors or mRNA vaccines can be helpful to fill the gap, a principle that has been impressively demonstrated by the mRNA and AdV-vector derived COVID-19 vaccines during the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Therefore, the validation of both H7 and N9 as designated cargo antigens of platform-based vaccines will help to design such future vaccines. For neuraminidase-directed responses, even a broader reactivity can be expected given the induction of antibodies against conserved epitopes of this protein54. For neuraminidase-targeted antibodies triggered during infection it has been anecdotally shown for N9, that monoclonal antibodies derived from such patients may be even cross-reactive across subtypes55 and animal models have indeed shown protection against the heterologous challenge from the same NA subtype56.Nevertheless, the immunological properties of the chosen antigens seem also to influence the immune responses, at least with respect to longevity of the latter. In contrast to the H7-vaccine, no N9-directed T-cell responses could be identified in the geriatric mouse cohort. This finding could be due to the anecdotal character of this report comprising just two animals in the latter cohort due to most animals had reached their maximal lifespan and had to be sacrificed before T-cell responses could be measured. However, sustainability of antibody responses after vaccination with adjuvanted protein has already been described for H7 in human vaccine trials57 and our data are thus consistent with these observations. Moreover, the activity of H7-directed antibodies has been mapped58 and validated57,59 for H7N9-specific vaccines. On the other hand, it has become well established that also anti-neuraminidase responses can play a decisive role also in the framework of seasonal vaccines60. Accordingly, the protective capacity and the mechanism of N9-directed antibodies has already been described61. Therefore, the protection demonstrated by our N9-encoding platform-based vaccine that induces high neuraminidase-inhibiting antibody titers is well in accordance with such mechanisms. Surprisingly, we found also neuraminidase inhibiting activity in sera of mice vaccinated with MVvac2-H7(P) when tested via ELLA. This unexpected finding can be potentially explained by steric hindrance of antibodies binding the H7 at the apical receptor-binding domain or at the conserved stalk region, thus either cross-shielding the closely associated N9 tetramer from interaction with its substrate or pushing the neuraminidase tetramer away from the hemagglutinin trimer and the thereof bound sialic acids as demonstrated for monoclonal hemagglutinin-directed antibodies62.One potential limitation of our study is the animal model used for the vaccine study. We have been using mice deficient in the type-I interferon receptor and transgenic for huCD46, IFNAR−/−-CD46Ge mice. Although these mice are defective for some aspects of innate immunity, they have been used as gold-standard small animal model for the analysis of MeV-derived recombinant vaccines due to lack of permissiveness of other fully immune competent animals for MeV replication besides non-human primates (NHPs). Nevertheless, a considerable number of studies have demonstrated transferability of immunogenicity and efficacy data from the IFNAR−/−-CD46Ge mice into NHPs or human patients, reviewed in63. Moreover, we have demonstrated for a MeV-derived MERS vaccine candidate that replication of the applied recombinant vaccine virus is required for the induction of immune responses in these animals, since UV-inactivated inoculum did not cause any immune reactions64. Few years ago after the start of this project it was demonstrated that the decisive factor for susceptibility of mice for in vivo replication of MeV is the IFNAR−/− defect, while the CD46 transgene is having no obvious impact65. Therefore, this transgene may be abandoned in future in vivo studies.In any case, our study provides proof-of-concept for analyzing the antigen format of highly pathogenic AIV hemagglutinin and neuraminidase in the backbone of a recombinant MeV in an otherwise naïve animal. Thus, we cannot predict on the basis of these data the impact of preformed measles immunity on the performance of our vectors. Interestingly, this impact seems to differ depending on the respective vaccine candidate. While MeV-derived vectors encoding antigens of HIV-122 or CHIKV23 have been showing comparable induction of at least humoral responses in pre-immune and naïve mice, NHPs, or for MV-CHIKV even human patients29,30, the further development of a MeV-derived COVID-19 vaccine was stopped after early clinical trials revealed noncompetitive immunogenicity, which correlated negatively with the degree of pre-immunity66. Thus, parameters determining the impact of pre-immunity and the causes for the initially rather surprising perseverance of at least some MeV-derived vectors in the face of measles immunity remain to be understood. Nevertheless, MeV was chosen as the platform technology for providing proof of concept, here, also since recombinant MeV can be generated within less than a month. This is depicted by our studies concerning the MeV-derived COVID-19 vaccine, where complete immunogenicity data were available within 6 months after the SARS-CoV-2 sequence became available67 and animal experiments revealed to be the rate limiting step to prove efficacy26.In summary, we were able to demonstrate with the recombinant measles vaccine technology, that both hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of the highly pathogenic IAV subtype H7N9 can be effective antigen targets for platform-based approaches. This adds another subtype to the list to preclinical studies proofing efficacy for MeV-derived vaccine candidates when encoding the hemagglutinin of seasonal influenza68, the 2009 pandemic H1N1 subtype61,69 or pre-pandemic highly pathogenic avian subtype H5N170. Here, powerful cellular and humoral immune responses were induced against both H7 and N9 that were extremely long-lived in the case of H7-directed responses. Thereby vaccinated mice were completely (H7) or mostly (N9) protected against lethal challenge, validating side-by-side the efficacy of both antigens for the future design of platform-based pandemic influenza vaccines.MethodsCellsMDCK (Canis familiaris kidney) (ATCC CCL-34), Vero (African green monkey kidney) (ATCC CCL-81) and 293 T (ATCC CRL-3216) cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured in DMEM (Cat.No. BE12-741F, Lonza, Cologne, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) and 2 mM L-Gln (Biochrom). JAWSII dendritic cells (ATCC CRL-11904) were purchased from ATCC and cultured in MEM-α with ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides (Cat.No. 22571020, GIBCO BRL, Eggenstein, Germany) supplemented with 20% FBS, 2 mM L-Gln, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Biochrom), and 5 ng/ml murine GM-CSF (Peprotech, Hamburg, Germany). DC2.4 murine dendritic cells71 were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Cat.No. L0500-500, Biowest, Nuaillé, France) containing 10% FBS, 2 mM L-Gln, 1% non-essential aminoacids (Biochrom), 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), and 50 µM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany). All cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 6% CO2 for a maximum of 6 months of culture after thawing of the original stock.PlasmidsThe HA and NA genes of A/Shanghai/2/2013 (H7N9) influenza virus were amplified by PCR flanked with AatII/MluI binding sites using pCAGGS-H7 and pCAGGS-N972,73 as templates and primer pairs H7 fwd / H7 rev and N9 fwd / N9 rev (Supplementary Tab. 1), respectively. Amplicons were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen Life technologies) according to manufacturer´s instructions, and fully sequenced. Both antigens, as well as the CMV promotor74, were inserted into p(+)BR-MVvac2-GFP(H) or p(+)MVvac2-ATU(P)75 via AatII/MluI or SfiI/SacII, respectively, to generate p(+)PolII-MVvac2-H7(H), p(+)PolII-MVvac2-H7(P), p(+)PolII-MVvac2-N9(H), or p(+)PolII-MVvac2-N9(P). Thereby, the influenza virus antigens are encoded by measles genomes possessing otherwise Moraten and Schwarz vaccine strain-identical coding capacity. For construction of lentiviral transfervectors encoding H7, N9, or MeV nucleocapsid protein N, the respective ORFs were amplified by PCR with primers H7fwdNheI/H7revXhoI or N9fwdNheI/N9revXhoI (Supplementary Table 1), respectively, encompassing flanking NheI/XhoI restriction sites. PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen Life technologies) and fully sequenced. Intact antigen ORFs were cloned into pCSCW2gluc-IRES-GFP76 using NheI/XhoI restriction sites to yield pCSCW2-H7-IRES-GFP, pCSCW2-N9-IRES-GFP, or pCSCW2-MV-N-IRES-GFP, respectively.Production of lentiviral gene-transfer vectorsLentiviral gene-transfer vectors were produced using 293 T cells and polyethylenimine (PEI) (Sigma-Aldrich) transfection77. In detail, 1×107 293 T cells were seeded per 175 cm2 cell culture flasks and cultured overnight. To produce VSV-G pseudotyped lentiviral vectors, these cells were transfected using a standard three-plasmid lentiviral vector system78. For transfection 17.5 μg pCSCW2-H7-IRES-GFP, pCSCW2-N9-IRES-GFP, or pCSCW2-MV-N-IRES-GFP transfer vector, 6.23 μg pMD2.G, and 11.27 μg pCMVΔR8.979 in 1.5 ml DMEM w/o additives were mixed with 1.5 ml DMEM containing 18 mM polyethyleneimine by vortexing for 1 min. After 10 min incubation at RT, the transfection mixture was added dropwise into the T175 cell culture. The medium was exchanged the day after and [HIVH7-IRES-GFP(VSV-G)], [HIVN9-IRES-GFP(VSV-G)], or [HIVMV-N-IRES-GFP(VSV-G)] vector particles were harvested two and three days after transfection. For the harvest of vector particles, the supernatant of transfected culture flasks was filtered (0.45 μm), pooled, if applicable, and concentrated by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 3 h, 4 °C). Supernatants were discarded, vector-containing pellets suspended in DMEM, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C.Generation of antigen-expressing cell linesSyngeneic antigen-presenting cells, i.e. the C57BL/6-derived DC lines JAWSII or DC2.4, were transduced with [HIVH7-IRES-GFP(VSV-G)] or [HIVN9-IRES-GFP(VSV-G)] vector-containing supernatant in dilution series to select singly transduced cell clones, which co-express H7 or N9 and GFP (JAWSIIgreen-H7, JAWSIIgreen-N9, DC2.4green-H7, and DC2.4green-N9, respectively). Syngeneic DC line JAWSII was transduced with [HIVMV-N-IRES-GFP(VSV-G)] to co-express MeV-N and GFP (JAWSIIgreen-MV-N). For analysis of transduction efficiencies, cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), and the percentage of GFP-positive cells was quantified by flow cytometry using an LSRII flow cytometer (BD, Heidelberg, Germany). Cell populations revealing a 1% to 10% fraction of GFP-positive cells were used for single-cell cloning by limiting dilution. For that purpose, dilutions of cell suspensions with 50 μl conditioned medium statistically containing 0.3 cells were seeded per well in 96-well plates. Single cells clones were cultured and analyzed by flow cytometry. GFP-positive clones were selected for further analysis. These transduced cell clones express present the respective processed antigen-epitopes of H7 or N9, or for control purpose MeV-N via MHC-I24.VirusesRecombinant MeV were rescued according to the method of Martin et al. 74. In brief, 5 μg of MeV genome plasmids with H7- or N9-expression cassettes were co-transfected with pCA-MV-N (0.4 μg), pCA-MV-P (0.1 μg), and pCA-MV-L (0.4 μg) encoding MeV RNP proteins into 293 T cells cultured in 6-well plates using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Life Technology) according to the manufacturer´s instructions. The transfected 293 T cells were overlaid two days after transfection onto 50% confluent Vero cells seeded in 10 cm-dishes the day before. Overlay cultures were closely monitored for isolated syncytia indicating monoclonal replicative centers. Single syncytia were picked and incubated with 50% confluent Vero cells cultured in 6-well plates. This “passage 0” (P0) virus clones were harvested by scraping all cells into the culture medium at the time of maximal infection. Cells were broken up by one freeze-thaw cycle, cellular debris removed by centrifugation (3000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), the virus-containing supernatant was aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. Subsequent passages were generated after TCID50 titration of infectious virus by limiting dilution according to the method of Kaerber and Spaerman80 and infection of Vero cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.03. Selected single virus clones were passaged up to P10.Multistep viral growth kinetics of recombinant MeV were analysed by infecting Vero cells at an MOI of 0.03 in 12-well plates and incubating the cultures at 37 °C. At various time points, supernatants were clarified by centrifugation, and cells were scraped into OptiMEM and subjected to freeze-thaw cycles. Released and cell-associated viral titers were determined by TCID50 titration of infectious virus by limiting dilution according to the method of Kaerber and Spaerman80.Generation by reverse genetics of the 2:6 recombinant IAV containing hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of A/Shanghai/2/2013 (H7N9) and the other 6 gene segments of the laboratory strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) (A/Shanghai/2/2013-A/PR/8/34 (H7N9)) was described73. This recombinant virus was used for IPMA, neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI). The wild type zoonotic H7N9 virus isolate used for challenge experiments, A/Anhui/1/2013, was kindly provided by John McCauley, Crick Worldwide Influenza Centre, London, United Kingdom. Influenza viruses were propagated in MDCK cells (cells washed 2x with PBS before) in the presence of 1 µg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma-Adrich) in the cell infection medium (DMEM, 2 mM L-Gln, 0.6% BSA) and were harvested in aliquots after 48 h at appearance of a clear cytophathic effect. The viral stocks were titrated using plaque assay under semi-solid overlay medium81. Briefly, 90% confluent MDCK cells grown in 6-well plates were incubated with 10-fold serial dilutions of the virus stock diluted in virus dilution medium (DMEM, 1 mM L-Gln, 0.1% BSA) for 1 h. Subsequently, overlay medium (1× EMEM (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 1.5% Avicel-RC 591 (FMC BioPolymer), 2 mM L-Gln, 0.1% BSA, 0.75 μg/ml TPCK-trypsin) was added to infected cells after removal of infection medium. Cells were then fixed 2-3 days post infection with 4% formaldehyde solution after removal of overlay medium and plaques were subsequently counter-stained with 0.1% crystal violet solution (20% MeOH). All virus stocks were stored in aliquots at -80 °C.Sequence analysis of MeV genomesThe RNA genomes of recombinant MeV in P3 or P10 were isolated using the QIAamp RNeasy Kit (QIAgen, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturers´ instructions, re-suspended in 50 μl RNase-free water and either directly used or stored at -20 °C. Viral cDNA was reversely transcribed using Superscript II RT kit (Invitrogen) with 2 μl vRNA as template and random hexamer primers, according to manufacturer´s instructions. For specific amplification of the genomic regions of interest, the respective stretches were amplified by PCR using primers binding to flanking sequences and cDNA as template. Detailed description of primers and procedures are available upon request. The gel-purified PCR products were subsequently sequenced (Eurofins Genomics, Ebersberg, Germany).Western Blot analysisFor Western Blot analysis, infected cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0; 62.5 mM EDTA; 1% NP-40; 0.4% deoxycholate; 40 μl/ml protease inhibitor cocktail (25×; Roche, Mannheim, Germany)). Cell lysates were denatured by incubation for 10 min at 95 °C in 2× urea sample buffer (5% SDS, 8 M urea, 200 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.03% bromphenol blue, 2.5% DTT, pH 8.0), separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and electrotansferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany). The membranes were blocked with 1% milk powder in PBS and subsequently incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at RT. A polyclonal rabbit serum raised against influenza virus A/FPV/Rostock/1934 (H7N1) (1:5000) was used as primary antibody to detect H7, and rabbit anti-MeV-N polyclonal antibody (1:25,000) (Cat.No. ab23974; Abcam, Cambridge) for MeV-N detection. Donkey HRP-coupled anti-rabbit IgG (H&L) serum (1:10,000) (Cat.No. 611-7302; Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA) served as secondary antibody in both staining procedures. Peroxidase activity was visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) on Amersham Hyperfilm ECL films (GE Healthcare).Neuraminidase activity assay1 × 104/well Vero cells cultured in 96-well black polystyrene plates with clear bottom (Corning, Wiesbaden, Germany) were infected at an MOI of 0.05 to 5 with MVvac2-N9(H) or MVvac2-N9(P) for 48 hours at 37 °C. Supernatants were removed, and 50 μL of 0.2 mM 2′-(4-Methylumbelliferyl)-α-D-N-acetylneuraminate (MUNANA) (Sigma, stock in N,N-dimethylformamide) diluted in NA-assay buffer (4 mM CaCl2 in TBS, pH 7.0) was added. Plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. 100 μL NA-assay stop buffer (pH 10.7; 25% ethanol; 0.1 M glycine; 0.3% Tween 20; in H2O) was added and plates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Free 4-methylumbelliferone was determined using a spectrofluorometer (excitation at 365 nm, emission at 450 nm). Concentration of 4-methylumbelliferone was calculated according to a 4-methylumbelliferone salt (Sigma) standard curve.Animal experimentsAll animal experiments were carried out in compliance with the regulations of the German animal protection law and have been authorized by the RP Darmstadt. Six- to 12-week-old IFNAR−/−-CD46Ge mice28 were inoculated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 1 × 105 TCID50 of recombinant MeV or 200 μl OptiMEM on days 0 and 28, and bled via the retrobulbar route on days 0, 28, and 32 or 49 p.i. under anesthesia. Mice were euthanized on days 32 or 49 p.i., and spleens were isolated. Serum samples were stored at -20 °C. For challenge experiments, immunized mice were challenged i.n. 21 days post booster immunization with 10-fold LD50 dose (104 pfu) of A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) strain in 30 μl. Survival of infected mice were checked for maximal 21 days (cutoff criteria >20% weight loss) or until weight had normalized to the initial value.For H7N9 neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition assay, sera were heat-inactivated for 30 min at 56 °C and treated with 20% RDE (receptor destroying enzyme) at 37 °C overnight. Treated sera were 1:2 diluted with 1.5% sodium citrate solution, incubated at 56 °C for 30 minutes, and stored at -20 °C.Immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA)1 × 104/well MDCK cells cultured in 96-well plates were infected at an MOI of 0.2 with recombinant influenza virus strain A/Shanghai/2/2013-A/PR/8/34 (H7N9). Two days post infection, infectious supernatants were discarded and the plates were heat-dried at 65 °C for 8 h. 50 μl of serially 2-fold diluted mice sera (starting from 1:8 dilution) were incubated with the dried cells for 2 h at room temperature. After 1x washing with PBS, the plates were incubated with peroxidase-conjungated rabbit-anti-mouse antiserum (1:750 in PBS) (Cat.No. P0260; H&L, Dako) for 1 h at room temperature. 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC) substrate solution was prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions using AEC dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (Merck Millipore) and used for visualization of infected cells. The reaction was stopped by addition of H2O. Antibody titers were calculated as the reverse of the highest sera dilution allowing staining of infected cells.Neutralization assaysFor quantification of virus neutralizing titers (VNT), mouse sera were two-fold serially diluted in DMEM. For testing neutralization of MeV, 50 PFU of MVvac2-GFP(P)64 were mixed with diluted sera, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The serum-treated virus suspensions were added to 1 × 104 Vero cells seeded 4 h prior to assay in 96-well plates and incubated for 4 d at 37 °C. Vero cells were subsequently analyzed for syncytia formation, and VNT was calculated as reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that fully abrogated infectivity. For testing neutralization of H7N9 influenza virus, 200 TCID50 of H7N9 A/Shanghai/2/2013-A/PR/8/34 virus were incubated with two-fold serial sera dilutions for 20 min at room temperature. 2 × 104 MDCK cells were added to the virus suspension in 96-wells and incubated at 37 °C for 2 d. Then, infected cells were immune-stained using a polyclonal ferret anti-PR/8 serum to visualize infection by non-neutralized influenza virus. Virus neutralizing titers (VNT) were calculated as the reciprocal of the highest dilution abolishing infection.Hemagglutination inhibition assay4 hemagglutinating units (HAU) of A/Shanghai/2/2013-A/PR/8/34 (H7N9) in 25 µl PBS were added to 25 μl of 2-fold serially diluted sera in 96-U-well plates (Nunc) starting with an initial dilution of 1:10. Following incubation for 30–45 min at room temperature, 50 µl of a solution of 0.75% chicken red blood cells (RBCs) in Alsever’s solution (2.05% dextrose, 0.8% sodium citrate, 0.055% citric acid, and 0.42% sodium chloride) were added. The plates were incubated at room temperature until hemagglutination was observed. The HAI titer was calculated as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution preventing hemagglutination of RBCs by influenza virions.Enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA)38 Flat 96-well plates with high protein-binding capacity (Nunc MaxiSorp) were coated overnight with 100 µl fetuin (25 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.1 M PBS. To determine concentration of the probe to be used for ELLA, A/Shanghai/2/2013-A/PR/8/34 (H7N9) suspension was serially diluted in Dulbecco’s PBS with supplements (pH 7.4, 0.9 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 1 % BSA, 0.5 % Tween 20). 50 µl of sample diluent was added into the fetuin-coated plates. 50 µl of virus dilutions were afterwards dispensed into fetuin-coated plates. Plates were incubated 16-18 h at 37 °C. After washing 6× with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T), 100 μl peanut agglutininin conjugated to horse-radish peroxidase solution (PNA-HRPO, Sigma) were added per well and incubated for 2 h at RT. After 3× washing with PBS-T, 100 μl o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride substrate (OPD, Sigma) were added per well and incubated for 10 min in the dark, before the reaction was stopped by addition of 100 μl sulfuric acid (1 N) per well. Finally, plates were read at 490 nm. The virus dilution resulting in 90-95 % of maximum signal was chosen as the appropriate concentration for testing the anti-neuraminidase activity of the respective mouse sera. Sera of mice were heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min and 2-fold serially diluted in PBS starting with an initial dilution of 1:5. 50 μl of sera dilutions in duplicates were dispensed into fetuin-coated plates, and 50 μl of the previously determined virion dilution added. ELLA was performed as described above. The mean absorbance of the background (Abkg) was subtracted from the test wells and positive control (Apos) wells. The percent NA activity was calculated by dividing the mean absorbance of duplicate test wells (Atest) by the mean absorbance of virus-only wells and multiplied by 100, i.e. (Atest − Abkg)/(Apos − Abkg) × 100. To determine percent NA inhibition, the percent activity was subtracted from 100. The 50% end-point NAI titer was defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution resulting in at least 50% inhibition of maximum signal in the assay.ELISpot assaysMurine IFN-γ ELISpot assays were purchased (ebioscience, Frankfurt, Germany) and performed according to manufacturer´s instructions using Multiscreen-IP ELISPOT PVDF 96-well plates (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). For this purpose, 5 × 105 splenocytes isolated 4 d after booster immunization were co-cultured with 5 × 104 JAWSIIgreen- or DC2.4green-cells transgenic for H7 or N9, or the unmodified DC cell lines in 200 μl RPMI with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-Gln and 1 IU/ml Penicillin/ 100 µg/mL Streptomycin in above mentioned ELISPOT PVDF 96-well plates. Medium alone served as negative control. 10 μg/ml Concanavalin A (ConA, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was used for general stimulation of splenocyte reactivity. 10 μg/ml MeV bulk antigens (Virion Serion, Würzburg, Germany) were used to stimulate MeV-specific T cells. After 36 h of stimulation, the splenocytes were removed from the plates, which were subsequently incubated with biotin-conjugated anti-IFN-γ antibodies and avidin-HRP according to the manufacturer´s instructions. 100 µl of 3-amino-9-ethyl-carbazole (AEC, Sigma-Aldrich) chromogen dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (Merck Millipore) was used for staining of spots. The reaction was stopped by washing with H2O. Spots were counted using an Eli.Scan ELISpot Scanner (A.EL.VIS, Hamburg, Germany) and ELISpot Analysis Software (A.EL.VIS).Statistical analysisTo compare the means of different groups in growth curves, neutralization assay, and ELISpot, non-parametric One-way ANOVA was applied.Material availability statementUnique biological materials used in this study are available via commercial sources were indicated or via the corresponding author of this study upon reasonable request.

C. McGrath ORCID: orcid.org/0000-0002-9267-55011 & Patrick C. Wilson ORCID: orcid.org/0000-0002-3537-12451 Nature Immunology volume 24, pages 570–572 (2023)Cite this article 3974 Accesses 9 Altmetric Metrics details Subjects AntibodiesImmunological memory Antibody dynamics resulting from sequential immunization are complex, limiting the study of concepts such as ‘original antigenic sin’. Here, molecular fate-mapping defines an ‘addiction’ of boosted antibodies to primary clones, and OAS-like suppression of new clones, to a degree inversely related to boosting antigenic distance. Booster immunizations are a hallmark of most vaccination schedules, including against highly mutative viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2. These pathogens evade immunity via rapid antigenic evolution at key protective epitopes; thus, in addition to elevating or ‘refreshing’ levels of pre-existing protective immune mediators (such as specific antibodies and T cells), boosters also aim to ‘update’ or diversify the adaptive immune repertoire against novel strains, to broaden protection. However, despite the established utility of this approach, concerns exist regarding the potential for ‘original antigenic sin’ (OAS)1, a phenomenon wherein primary antibody responses may interfere with the quality and magnitude of secondary responses, reducing the overall efficacy of booster immunizations and/or predisposing to secondary infection. In this issue of Nature, Schiepers et al.2 develop a molecular fate-mapping ‘K-tag’ mouse model to deconvolute this phenomenon, specifically by unravelling serum OAS-like antibody dynamics in mice following sequential exposure to homologous and drifted viral antigens.The concept of OAS was first proposed by Thomas Francis Jr in the mid-1950s to explain particular patterns of influenza-reactive antibody titers among cohorts of different ages1. Specifically, Francis noted that antibodies specific for influenza ‘families’ encountered first during childhood characterize individuals throughout their life, and are successively boosted by subsequent exposure to drifted variants. Today, immunologists consider this to fit within the scope of ‘antigenic imprinting’, a broader term that accounts for childhood-derived memory biases irrespective of implication (such as biases that could either modulate or not modulate future de novo antibody induction, and/or lead to either protection against or susceptibility to future infection)3. To date, there have been several reports describing the beneficial effects of imprinted memory responses to influenza (see, for example, refs. 3,4,5) and, more recently, SARS-CoV-26. However, Francis also posited that this early-life bias could negatively affect novel antibody responses to drifted variants1. Although examples of OAS-like immune bias have been observed7, this ‘sinful’ aspect of imprinting has been difficult to study under experimental conditions. In part, this has been due to technical limitations in discriminating antibodies derived from initial versus subsequent antigen exposures, independent of other attributes such as specificity, isotype or affinity maturation.Recently, advancements in mouse genomics such as the development of inducible Cre-lox systems have helped lift this barrier, allowing researchers to investigate the contribution of primary versus secondary antibody responses following variant viral antigen exposure. In this vein, Schiepers et al.2 modified the mouse kappa antibody light chain gene to encode a Cre-excisable Flag tag, with a Strep tag further downstream. Without intervention, these IgkTag/Tag mice produce Flag-tagged antibodies. However, when they are bred with germinal center (GC) B cell-restricted tamoxifen-inducible Cre mice, immunized or infected, and given tamoxifen over a restricted timeframe (on days 4, 8 and 12), the Flag insert is removed and Strep-tagged antibodies are produced instead (Fig. 1a). In this way, cellular progeny and antibodies derived from the ‘primary cohort’ of GC B cells are identifiable as Strep+. Subsequently, upon cessation of tamoxifen, B cells activated as part of any secondary or tertiary immunization are instead identifiable as Flag+. Using this approach, the authors demonstrate that, in the context of homologous immunizations (that is, repeated immunization with the same antigen), de novo boost-derived serological antibody responses are inhibited, concurrent with an ‘addiction’ to prime-derived clones. This suppression of de novo responses approached a substantial magnitude of 55-fold in the context of homologous wild-type SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination (Fig. 1b). In contrast, boosting with immunogens of sufficient antigenic distance, such as increasingly drifted influenza A hemagglutinins (HAs) or SARS-CoV-2 variant spike mRNAs, allowed more room for both new (boost-derived) and old (prime-derived) antibodies; de novo suppression was mitigated to <4-fold (Fig. 1b,c). Finally, the authors used deep mutational scanning to classify epitopes targeted by primary (Strep+) and secondary (Flag+) antibodies following heterologous prime boost (sequential SARS-CoV-2 spike wild-type and BA.1 mRNA), finding that primary cohort antibodies tended to target conserved regions of the glycoprotein, while de novo secondary Flag+ antibodies targeted BA.1-specific antigenic sites.Fig. 1: Molecular fate-mapping to decipher OAS.a, Schiepers et al.2 designed a mouse model wherein the administration of tamoxifen after primary immunization or infection labels all antibodies derived from the primary germinal center B cells with a Strep tag. Upon cessation of tamoxifen treatment, any antibodies produced by subsequent secondary or tertiary immunization will be tagged with Flag. b,c, Using this model, the authors showed that sequential immunization with SARS-CoV-2 spike mRNA vaccines (b) and influenza hemagglutinins (c) elicits an ‘addiction’ to clones from the primary cohort, and a suppression of de novo secondary clonal activation. Although this effect was strong in the case of homologous antigen exposure (b,c, top row), immunization with drifted variants both updated the antibody repertoire and largely, but not completely, mitigated de novo suppression (b,c, bottom row(s)). These findings suggest that booster vaccines for viral variants serve a crucial function in diversifying the antibody repertoire, but that new secondary antibody clones are in fact inhibited in an OAS-like manner, to a degree dependent on antigenic distance. Figure created using BioRender (biorender.com).Full size imageConcerns about the impact of OAS are founded on the idea that pre-existing immunity elicited by initial exposure to one antigenic variant may suppress de novo responses to new epitopes on drifted variants of the same molecule. With regard to influenza, it is estimated that individuals experience 1–4 immunogenic H3N2 infections per decade, with higher rates in childhood8. Although substantial, this is almost certainly an underestimate of total influenza infections, in that H1N1 and influenza B were not assessed. Furthermore, annual vaccination against circulating strains is recommended for individuals aged six months or older in many countries. In aggregate, human exposure to rapidly evolving influenza antigens such as HA and neuraminidase begins to stimulate the immune system early in life and continues throughout. The consequence of this is evidenced by a recent observation that 95% of pre-existing B cells reactive to an infecting H3N2 influenza strain cross-reacted to past strains, with most binding to non-protective but conserved epitopes7. Thus, if an OAS-like phenomenon can limit de novo responses against drifted antigenic variants, efforts to optimize antibody immunity against relevant circulating influenza strains may be continually hindered by a lifetime of past exposures.In dissecting this phenomenon at the molecular level, the authors2 shed light on the utility of booster vaccines in the context of pre-existing immunity. Initially, the group observed a strong, suppressive OAS-like phenomenon for secondary serum antibodies elicited by homologous prime-boost. These data are in line with previous observations of reduced serum antibody responses in a cohort of people immunized with identical versus variant influenza vaccine strains over multiple years9. However, this is likely of evolutionary advantage, given that for conserved antigens and slowly evolving pathogens, it is logically of greater value to prioritize reactivation of memory B cells (a rapid pre-matured response) rather than re-engagement of naive B cells (a slower immature response) if the latter provides no qualitative benefit to the antibody repertoire. Thus, although this observation fits the bill for OAS, it is of little concern in terms of the efficacy of homologous boosters. In comparison, as boosting antigens became antigenically divergent, the magnitude of this suppression was substantially mitigated. Some suppression of de novo responses did remain (~4-fold for drifted HA (10% amino acid difference) and SARS-CoV-2 spike (2% difference), versus ~55-fold for homologous antigen). Importantly, a large proportion of the Flag+ BA.1-specific titers elicited were not cross-reactive to wild-type spike, and specifically bound drifted BA.1 epitopes. Thus, while confirming that booster immunizations perform their intended function in updating the immune repertoire, these data also show that novel-variant-reactive clonotypes can indeed be suppressed by pre-existing immunity, in line with the classical model of OAS. Although marginal compared to that seen with homologous boosting, the ~4-fold suppression observed for variant boosting (if translatable to humans) may be of concern, specifically in the context of vaccinating individuals with immune deficiencies or comorbidities.Fate-mapping of serum antibodies represents an important technological step forward in our ability to understand serological phenomena such as OAS. Previously, analyses had largely been restricted to the tracking of antigen-specific B cells and antibody clonotypes. In earlier work, naive-derived clones were observed to dominate recall GC responses over memory-derived clones in the context of both homologous and drifted HA boosting10. Extrapolating this to the serum antibody level and interpreting it through the lens of OAS, one might expect the resulting boost-elicited antibodies to derive from this secondary naive B cell cohort (that is, be primarily Flag+ here) and might expect to find negligible ‘primary addiction’ or de novo suppression. However, the predominance of Strep+ antibodies seen here after boosting contradicts this idea. In comparison, these findings are in line with the predisposition of boosted serum influenza-specific antibodies to maintain a high degree of clonotypic stability over time11 and to derive mainly from pre-existing memory B cell clones during variant influenza exposures7. Although this may explain the observation of ‘primary addiction’, additional context is required to understand how this relates to de novo suppression, which is likely to involve phenomena such as epitope masking by recalled antibody clones and/or rapid absorption of re-encountered antigens via immune complex uptake12. Overall, this work2 is the first to extend polyclonal antibody analyses beyond specificity and isotype to origin, and in doing so, provides clear experimental evidence in mice for the existence of a surprisingly potent OAS-like phenomenon at the serological level.Moving forward, antibody fate-mapping and the precise quantification of de novo suppression could assist the development of optimized vaccines against antigenically variable pathogens such as influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and HIV. Although it is clear that variant-specific serum antibodies can be suppressed by pre-existing immunity, it will be of interest to ask whether boost-derived clones targeting individual variant epitopes are suppressed in a uniform or biased manner. If the latter, there may be benefit in formulating preclinical vaccine candidates to shepherd novel antibody responses toward less suppressed sites. In addition, understanding whether different vaccination strategies (mRNA, split, recombinant, diverse adjuvants) can modulate the degree of suppression may guide the future use and evolution of specific vaccine platforms. In answering these and similar questions, antibody fate-mapping represents a useful new tool to help mitigate the pernicious influence of OAS in viral vaccine development. ReferencesFrancis, T. Proc.

(Photo courtesy: Getty Images ) Daphne ClaranceNew Delhi,UPDATED: Mar 20, 2023 19:16 ISTIn ShortThe strain of influenza B seen in India is Victoria, while in influenza A, H3N2 is very prominent.The typical symptom of the current H3N2 virus is fever, ranging between 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit.The treatment for the two viruses also differs in terms of specific symptoms.India is witnessing severe cases of the influenza virus, simultaneously with a spike in the incidence of Covid-19. Although the two respiratory viruses have overlapping symptoms, doctors have shared some differences to recognise signs when a person gets influenza or Covid-19. Influenza occurs in two types A and B. Influenza A, which is currently circulating in the country, is of two different types - H1N1 and H3N2. Influenza B comes in two lineages as well - Victoria and Yamagata. advertisementThe strain of influenza B seen in India is the Victoria lineage, while in influenza A, the H3N2 is very prominent. H1N1 is doing the rounds as well but with fewer cases of incidence, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). According to Dr V Ravi, Virologist and Head of Research and Development, Tata Medical and Diagnostics, New Delhi, the symptoms are more severe in H3N2 than Covid because most people have received two doses of vaccines of the latter, which now has mild ways on influencing. "The typical symptom of the current H3N2 virus is fever, ranging between 101 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit. A very severe cough is seen while many patients are also experiencing a sore throat or change in voice. The most severe symptom is difficulty breathing," said Dr Ravi. He added that the fever usually lasts for 4 to 5 days. However, the cough will persist for another week. "This is because the virus affects the windpipe and bronchioles that produce the cough," he said. The most prominent difference between Covid and H3N2 is that it is more contagious and spreads very fast from human to human because of the nature of the virus, but H3N2, like H1N1, spreads seasonally, usually during the change of season. Covid is more contagious and spreads way faster than H3N2.(Photo courtesy: PTI) "The severity of illnesses, however, is almost equal. H3N2 can also become severe, like pneumonia. In rare cases, a lung transplant might be needed," as per Dr Chinnadurai R, Lead Consultant - Critical Care, Aster RV Hospital, Bangalore. "I think we are going back to the pre-Covid era in which the H3N2 is dominating," he added. Dr Chinnadurai said that if a Covid-infected person speaks to someone, in 10 minutes the virus spreads."But in H3N2, it is not likely to spread very fast if two people are talking. The possibility may be that we could have better immunity to fight H3N2 because pre-Covid this was part of the seasonal flu," he said.Dr Tanu Singhal, Consultant, Paediatrics and Infectious Disease, Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, Mumbai, said that the two viruses are usually transmitted through cough droplets that spread for 1 metre or 3 feet. "That's why the risk of transmission is higher in closed spaces compared to larger spaces," the expert said. The treatment for the two viruses also differs in terms of specific symptoms. While in H3N2, anti-fever medication is prescribed, for Covid, doctors recommend Covid-specific drugs that are newer in the market. To diagnose the two viruses, an advanced PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test can be taken. However, it is expensive. "There is an advanced PCR test that tests for all respiratory viruses. In this time, we're not just seeing a spread of Covid or flu but other viruses like Adenovirus and human metapneumovirus(HPV). This advanced PCR test can see all these kinds of viruses. The only problem is that the tests are very expensive, ranging between Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000," said Dr Singhal.Published By: Daphne ClarancePublished On: Mar 20, 2023--- ENDS ---ALSO READ | India confirms first H3N2 influenza death: All you need to know about the virus Watch Live TV AdvertisementAlso WatchBJP's 'divisive politics' will not work in Maharashtra: Aaditya ThackerayHera Pheri reunion!

India is witnessing a spike in cases of both COVID as well as the flu. People are advised to follow preventive measures of the pandemic to remain risk free. Both the infections have several similar symptoms and according to experts, it is possible for the two viruses to co-exist, leading to co-infection. However, as per experts, the probability of getting COVID-19 and H3N2 flu at the same time is very low.2/6​How co-infection happens?​SARS CoV-2 and H3N2 influenza both are transmitted through droplets and can infect someone else through the inhalation route. A person can get infected from both the illnesses at the same time, either getting both the infections from one patient or from two different patients.3/6​Who is at risk?​Health risk is higher in people who have poor immunity, are on steroids or immunosuppressive drugs, or have comorbidities like liver, kidney, or heart disease. Those who are cancer patients or have received an organ transplant are also at higher risk.4/6​Treatment​People with dual infections are not advised to take antibiotics. You just need to treat your symptoms to manage the viral disease, according to experts. Adequate hydration and proper rest are important for recovery.It is best to consult your doctor if you are not feeling well and suspect you may be infected. People at higher risk as those with conditions mentioned above should not skip consulting their doctor.5/6​Common signs to not ignore​There are several symptoms that could develop from either or both the viral infections. These include fever, cough, body ache, sore throat, loose stools, weakness, stuffiness of nose, sneezing, loss of smell, earache and nausea. It is best to get tested as soon as you get symptoms. H3N2 influenza is known to cause prolonged symptoms that can last for weeks or even months.COVID-19 and H3N2 influenza can be diagnosed with the help of RT-PCR tests (available individually and in combination).Read more: Tobacco consumption is the leading cause of TB in India: Key signs to note6/6​Is co-infection serious?​Having co-infection does not necessarily mean that your illness will be very serious. According to experts, severity of viral infections depends on multiple factors such as the infected person’s immunity, comorbidities, vaccination status etc. If you are vaccinated with both influenza and COVID vaccines, you can still catch the infection but are unlikely to develop severe illness despite co-infection.Read more: New study warns against side effects of taking paracetamol for back painFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories PreviousCountries where employees have the right to disconnect after workindiaHansika Motwani in Her Unmissable Aesthetic, Elegant Eraindia10 most photographed cities across the globetravelHair care: Ultimate tips to get rid of split endsindiaHow to make quick Dahi Bhalla with leftover bread under 25 minutesFoodRashami Desai ultra-glam looksindiaSonam Kapoor stuns in a brown saree paired with a chic crochet blouseindia9 ways to add Anjeer (Fig) to your breakfastFood10 reasons why jaggery is preferred over sugarFood Next123 Photostories 5 everyday morning habits to detox kidney and liverTop 10 countries with the largest gold reservesExclusive - Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah's Sharad Sankla on the popularity of his role Abdul; says 'Ek Hindu, ek Musalman ka role kar raha hai, aur log mujhe itna pyaar dete hain'From Daya falling while breaking dahi handi to Shree Krishna visiting Gokuldham for the festival; Looking back at the iconic Janmashtami moments from Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah10 best places to spot tigers in Indian forestsWorld's 5 best national parks to see endangered animals​Home remedy to reduce gas in the stomach in the morning​Natural phenomena to experience at least once in a lifetimeFrom accepting her vulnerabilities, dealing with loneliness to prioritising her daughters over everything: Debina Bonnerjee reveals how motherhood has changed her as a person123lifestyle videos03:00Karan Johar's Incredible Transformation Stuns Fans03:00Karan Johar's Incredible Transformation Stuns Fans05:35Is COVID Vaccine Causing Heart Attacks In Young Indians?

Photo: Lex SalverdaResearch has shown that new cases of bird flu are frequently down to human activity and not direct infection from wild birds.People carry the virus into premises on contaminated shoes, clothes, machines, animal feed and bedding, according to the results of a 5-year pan-European study.Professor Thomas Mettenleiter, head of the Friedrich Loeffler Institute for Animal Research, Germany, has just completed coordinating the EU-funded DELTA-FLU project, which set out to determine the key viral, host-related and environmental factors that determine the dynamics of avian influenza.ALSO READ: Multi-species study aids understanding of avian influenzaThe initiative, which ended late last year, brought together experts from Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, the UK, the US and Hong Kong.Mettenleiter said: “Highly pathogenic avian influenza has been a major animal disease for quite some time, but this has been particularly true over the past 5 years.”Continuous riskPreviously, migratory birds from Asia spread the virus to domestic birds in a seasonal pattern, with periods of low risk in summer. Infection has now changed from rare, sporadic outbreaks to a situation of continuous risk. Often this leads to domestic poultry being culled. And when bird flu is detected in an area, either in wild birds or on commercial premises, birds that would otherwise roam freely are now routinely ordered to quarantine in barns.“But our study has shown that it is frequently human activity and not direct infection from wild birds that causes new incursions of the virus,” said Mettenleiter.ALSO READ: Viruses cannot be stopped by bordersHigher hygieneMore care must be taken when handling poultry, and biosecurity measures need to be stepped up. As an output of the study, the research team have drafted guidelines for higher hygiene standards for personnel working with flocks in lockdown. The hope is that the guidelines will be adopted across Europe.The DELTA-FLU research project also unpacked the make-up of the prevailing bird flu strains on the continent. Using whole-genome sequencing techniques, the researchers made the surprise discovery that the bird flu in Europe is a “swarm incursion” – in other words, there are many variants circulating (more than 15 in Europe).ALSO READ: Avian influenza: Unspeakable damage and unexplainable consequencesBird flu in other animalsFrom this, the researchers demonstrated that variants are blending their genetic material to create new sub-variants. Worryingly, since 2016, some of these mutated viruses have spilt into other animals, including foxes, minks and seals. Globally, there have now been at least 200 recorded cases in mammals.They say a bird flu pandemic is unlikely unless the virus first becomes established in an intermediary mammal, most likely a pig. Pig cells have qualities that make it possible for viruses from both birds and humans to take hold and replicate.ALSO READ: Two vaccines show promising results against avian influenza“The worry is that a pig will someday act as a mixing vessel, co-hosting flu viruses from both birds and humans. This could result in a novel reassortment – a hybrid virus with genetic material from both viruses,” he added.Scientific work on more bird flu vaccines for poultry is taking place in parallel with persistent talks by governments across Europe about the merits of vaccination to counter the disease. Mettenleiter believes surveillance is extremely important in the context that vaccinated animals can lead to trade barriers in export markets.*Information about the study can be found here.

These foods can help you recover fasterWhen you're down with an influenza fever, focus on building your immunity with antioxidant-rich foods and whole grains.Listen to StoryLive TVShareAdvertisementImproper diet can increase the severity and the duration of the infection, says expert. (Photo courtesy: Getty Images)Daphne ClaranceNew Delhi,UPDATED: Mar 21, 2023 16:23 ISTIn ShortDiet can affect your recovery from influenza fever, said expert.Don't have raw salads, instead lightly cook your vegetables.Ginger and garlic are important components in recovery.There has been an alarming rise in cases of the H3N2 virus in the country. The influenza infection has caused several people to be admitted to ICUs due to breathing issues with a cold, sore throat, cough and runny nose being the common symptoms. If you're down with influenza fever, focus on boosting your immunity with various antioxidants and including foods rich in omega-3s and omega-6s in your diet. advertisement"An improper diet can increase the severity and the duration of the infection. A well-balanced diet helps to strengthen the immune system and also manages the infection complications," Komal Malik, Head Dietitian, Asian Hospital, Faridabad told indiatoday.in. ANTIOXIDANT-RICH FOODSFoods rich in antioxidants such as fresh fruits and vegetables should be included in the diet. Berries, kiwi and citrus fruits that contain vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, vitamin A and selenium can be consumed. Foods rich in antioxidants such as fresh fruits and vegetables should be included in the diet. (Photo courtesy: Pexels) WHOLE GRAINS"Don't forget that you need energy while recovering from the infection. For that, have whole grains to fight against the virus," as per the expert.Whole grains include millet, quinoa, brown rice, red rice, oatmeal and popcorn. Besides this, Komal Malik said to have pulses as well as they help in quick recovery.ANTI-MICROBIAL FOODSAnti-inflammatory or anti-microbial foods like ginger can be added to your foods and tea. Add garlic while cooking vegetables along with several herbs, spices, and condiments. SAY NO TO PROCESSED FOODSProcessed foods should be avoided as they lower the functioning of the immune system. "Freshly cooked meals rather than processed foods should be consumed. Avoid alcohol and smoking. Avoid carbonated and aerated drinks. Foods rich in trans fats, like deep-fried stuff, should also be avoided at all costs," said Komal Malik. Saute your vegetables instead of having raw salad. (Photo courtesy: Getty Images) Have plenty of fluids while recovering from any infection by drinking water, coconut water, lemon water and some herbal teas.YOGHURT AND FRUIT-BASED DRINKS"Make fruit-based drinks and add chia or pumpkin seeds to them. Yoghurt-based smoothies with nuts and seeds should also be consumed as they increase the nutritional value of your diet," said the dietitian. LIGHTLY COOKED SALADSDon't have raw salads. "Saute your vegetables lightly and add some garlic to the mix. Minimum cooking we is required when you have to just prepare a semi-cooked salad," she said.

The third human case tied to a dairy cow outbreak is reported in the U.S. By Rachel Nania, AARP Comments En español Published March 21, 2023 / Updated May 30, 2024 Matthew Hatcher/AFP via Getty Images Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Another person in the U.S. has been diagnosed with avian influenza﻿, also known as bird flu, associated with a multistate outbreak in dairy cows.﻿ The individual, a dairy farm﻿worker in Michigan, is the second person in the state and the third person in the U.S. to test positive for the virus amid the bovine outbreak. ﻿﻿ The first human case was confirmed in April, and the second was reported in mid-May. In both cases, the patients, who had been exposed to dairy cattle, only reported eye symptoms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).﻿ The third and latest individual experienced upper respiratory tract symptoms — including cough with no fever — along with eye irritation. Even with this latest case, the CDC said on May 30 that the risk to the general public remains low, since risk depends on exposure to infected animals. “However, this development underscores the importance of recommended precautions in people with exposure to infected or potentially infected animals. People with close or prolonged, unprotected exposures to infected birds or other animals (including livestock), or to environments contaminated by infected birds or other infected animals, are at greater risk of infection and should take precautions,” the CDC said. Here’s what you need to know about the evolving situation. What is bird flu? Just like humans can get infected with influenza, different versions of the virus can infect animals, including birds. Bird flu is caused by influenza A viruses that spread among wild aquatic birds (ducks, geese, gulls, etc.) and can infect poultry (chickens and turkeys). Bird flu can infect other animals, as is the case with the H5N1 strain, which has been detected in mammals such as foxes, bears, seals, mountain lions and﻿, most recently, cows.﻿ Since March 25, cases in cattle have been confirmed in several states, including Texas, Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico and Michigan. Matthew Binnicker, director of clinical virology at Mayo Clinic, tells AARP that infections in mammals often happen when the animal either eats infected birds or encounters a carcass. Mammals exposed to environments with a high concentration of the virus are also susceptible to infection, Tim Uyeki, M.D., the chief medical officer of the CDC’s Influenza Division, said in an “Ask the Expert” post. AARP NEWSLETTERS %{ newsLetterPromoText }% %{ description }% Subscribe See All Newsletters Privacy Policy ARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER ADVERTISEMENT Are humans at risk from bird flu? Bird flu infections in humans remain rare, health officials say, especially among those who are not in close contact with birds or other infected animals. ﻿ Infections can happen when the virus gets into a person’s eyes, nose or mouth or is inhaled, and symptoms can range from mild to severe. Importantly, we have yet to see sustained human-to-human transmission of bird flu, says Sabrina Assoumou, M.D., an infectious disease physician at Boston Medical Center and a professor of medicine at Boston University’s Chobanian and Avedisian School of Medicine. “However, because of the possibility that bird flu viruses could change and gain the ability to spread easily between people, monitoring for human infection and person-to-person spread is extremely important for public health,” the CDC says. Initial testing among the most recent cases infecting cattle in the U.S. did not detect any changes to the virus that would indicate it’s more transmissible to humans, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced. ﻿ “This virus is being closely monitored, and we have not seen signs of sustained human-to-human transmission at this point,” Natasha Bagdasarian, Michigan’s chief medical executive, said in a May 22 news release from the state’s Department of Health and Human Services. The CDC says more human cases could be identified; however, “sporadic human infections with no ongoing spread will not change the CDC risk assessment for the U.S. general public,” which, again, is low. ARTICLE CONTINUES AFTER ADVERTISEMENT What about bird flu vaccines and treatments? Your seasonal flu shot won’t protect you from a bird flu infection, but the CDC has vaccine formulas ready that target bird flu, and they could be used if the virus spread among people. The antiviral treatments approved for seasonal influenza are recommended for people infected with avian influenza, including H5N1, according to the CDC. Because antiviral treatments work best when started as soon as symptoms begin, contact your state or local health department and a health care provider right away if you get sick after being in close contact with potentially﻿ infected birds. Symptoms of bird flu and seasonal flu are similar. Keep an eye out for: FeverChillsCoughSore throatShortness of breathHeadachesRunny or stuffy noseBody achesDiarrhea What can you do to lower your risk of infection? The advice from health experts is to exercise caution around sick or dead animals. “If you own poultry or have birds on your property and any [of them] come down with an illness or die, do not handle the birds,” Binnicker says. “Contact your local or state public health officials to come and investigate.” (To keep your flocks from getting infected, take steps to prevent their exposure to wild birds, which carry the disease and don’t always appear sick.) The same goes if you’re out hunting and come across dead animals or birds — don’t touch the carcass. “Because, again, the cases that have occurred in humans have been from direct interaction and exposure with an infected or dead animal,” Binnicker says. Be sure to cook your poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165°F to kill bacteria and viruses, including bird flu viruses, the CDC says. Given the latest infections popping up in cows, avoid unpasteurized (raw) milk or products made from raw milk such as cheeses. There are not safety concerns with the commercial milk supply, federal health agencies say, because products are pasteurized ﻿— heated to a certain temperature for a specific period to kill any germs present ﻿— before entering the market. “And then from the human side, just the lessons that we’ve learned through the pandemic: If you have a respiratory illness, stay home. If you have to go out in public, wear a mask and go get tested, because finding out what the cause of the disease is, that is also still very important,” Binnicker says. A health care provider can test you for bird flu with a swab of the nose or throat.

In fact, taking antibiotics to try and treat viral illnesses might make us all sicker in the future.How antibiotics workAntibiotics were discovered by a scientist called Alexander Fleming in 1928, and are widely credited as one of the most important medical discoveries in human history.Antibiotics are used to treat infections caused by bacteria. Bacteria are very small organisms, and billions of them live in and on your body. Most of the time these bacteria are harmless or even helpful for your body, like those that help you to digest food, but some bacteria can cause diseases.There are two types of antibiotics that work to stop bacterial infections. Some slow down the growth of bacteria and damage their ability to reproduce and spread, while others kill the bacteria by destroying the bacteria cell walls. The choice of antibiotic depends on the type of bacteria.Why don’t antibiotics work on viruses?Viruses are different to bacteria; they have a different structure and a different way of surviving. Viruses don’t have cell walls that can be attacked by antibiotics; instead they are surrounded by a protective protein coat.Unlike bacteria, which attack your body’s cells from the outside, viruses actually move into, live in and make copies of themselves in your body’s cells. Viruses can't reproduce on their own, like bacteria do, instead they attach themselves to healthy cells and reprogram those cells to make new viruses. It is because of all of these differences that antibiotics don’t work on viruses.How can we treat a cold or flu virus?You might have heard the phrase that a virus has to ‘run its course’. This means waiting for your body’s immune system to fight off the viral infection by itself by activating an immune response. If you have a cold or the flu, during this time you might experience symptoms like:a runny or blocked nosesore throatheadachefevercoughand muscle aches.Resting in bed, drinking plenty of fluids (particularly water) and taking over-the-counter medication to relieve symptoms will help you recover from a virus. This is generally enough for otherwise healthy people. In some cases, your GP may prescribe antiviral medications to help reduce the severity and length of your illness.Most importantly, you can help protect yourself from catching the flu by getting a flu vaccine. The flu vaccine changes every year, so it is important to get a new one before winter each year.If you have a cold or the flu, you should visit your GP or call 13 HEALTH (13 43 25 84) for further advice if you experience any of the following symptoms:shortness of breath or trouble breathingchest paina really sore throat that hurts to swallowa cough that doesn’t go away after a few weeksa headache or sinus pain that won’t go awaypersistent vomiting which means you can’t keep any fluids downhave a high temperature (38°C or higher)feeling confused or disorientedor coughing up coloured phlegm.What’s wrong with taking antibiotics ‘just in case’?Like any living organism, bacteria can evolve and adapt to changing environments. This means that bacteria can become ‘resistant’ to antibiotics, if exposed to them enough. The video below explains how this can happen.As bacteria become resistant to antibiotics, the risk grows that harmful infections caused by bacteria can no longer be treated because we don’t have any tools left to fight them. Taking antibiotics when they aren’t needed can increase this risk for everyone and make antibiotics less effective overall.Taking antibiotics when you don’t need them is a waste and puts you at risk of side effects, like a rash, upset stomach or diarrhoea. It can also mean that they won’t work when you really need them for a serious infection.More informationQueensland Health | What you need to know about antibiotic resistance This page is tagged in the following topics Flu (Influenza) Antimicrobial resistance Last updated: 22 March 2023 Share Share via Facebook Share via Twitter Share via Linkedin Share via email Related content News Brisbane microbiologists lead the way against tuberculosis burden New tech spares surgery Healthy Ageing in Wide Bay Feature Inside the ICU: a doctor's perspective on treating severe flu cases How to tell the difference between a cold and influenza 6 things to know about immunisation in 2024 Back to top Queensland Health Contact us Get in touch for enquiries, feedback or complaints and compliments.

One flu that has been widely spoken about recently is H3N2. Influenza A H3N2 viruses were first detected in pigs over a decade ago. Multiple sporadic outbreaks have occurred since then, but all were due to a pig-to-human transmission. It is the first time that a broader virus outbreak has been observed in several countries, including India. A few reasons why H3N2 is spreading in India include low vaccination rates (for the flu vaccine) and high pollution. India has two peak seasons for the flu outbreak—between November and February and one during monsoons. Research so far states that H3N2 causes severe infection and illness in people over 65 years of age and children below 5 years. How Can You Catch H3N2 Flu? H3N2 flu is contagious and spreads through droplet infections like COVID-19 and other seasonal flu. You can catch the virus by coming in contact with an infected surface and touching your face, eyes or mouth immediately after. You can also develop the infection when you come in close contact with an infected person. Once your symptoms develop, they may last up to 5 or 7 days. What Are The Symptoms of H3N2 Flu? The symptoms of H3N2 flu are very similar to other seasonal flu and include: Runny or stuffy nose Sore throat with cough Headache Fever Chills Body ache Fatigue Diarrhoea Vomiting How is H3N2 Flu Diagnosed? While most doctors can diagnose the H3N2 flu due to its common symptoms with other flu, they may recommend patients undergo lab tests to rule out any other illnesses common during the season. How is H3N2 Flu Treated? The treatment for H3N2 flu depends upon the individual's symptoms and severity. Uncomplicated cases of H3N2 are treated like any other seasonal flu: Getting plenty of rest Drinking enough fluids (juice, soups, water) to stay hydrated Taking over-the-counter medications to help relieve fever, headache and body pain In some cases of H3N2, antivirals like oseltamivir, baloxavir and peramivir may be given. When antiviral medications are administered within 48 hours of developing flu symptoms, they can shorten the duration of the illness and prevent complications. Seek immediate medical care if you fall under the following high-risk categories: Adults over 65 years of age Children under 5 years of age Pregnant women Individuals with chronic medical conditions like diabetes, pneumonia, asthma, heart disease or weakened immune system Is There A Vaccine For H3N2 Flu? Flu vaccinations prevent severe diseases and symptoms in the general population. Unfortunately, there is no vaccine to prevent one from H3N2 flu specifically. The annual flu vaccine protects from three to four strains of the flu virus (hence they are called trivalent or quadrivalent). However, these flu vaccines protect you more from the H1N1 viruses and influenza B viruses than the H3N2 viruses. This happens because the H3N2 viruses undergo more frequent genetic changes than the others, making the vaccine less effective against them. What Is The Outlook of H3N2 Flu After Treatment? Despite the rising cases of H3N2 flu, most people can recover at home with or without treatment from their physicians. The flu symptoms last for around a week or two but the cough and weakness may linger for a couple of weeks longer. If you belong to a high-risk group, you must visit your doctor as soon as flu symptoms set in. Symptoms that may require you to seek emergency care include: Shortness of breath or difficulty in breathing Pain or pressure in the chest Dizziness or lightheadedness Severe or persistent vomiting Confusion Worsening of existing symptoms Can H3N2 Flu Be Prevented? Though we still don’t have an H3N2-specific vaccine, we can still protect ourselves and our loved ones from this infection using the following steps: Get the yearly flu shot, preferably before winter sets in. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water, especially after using the washroom, before eating and touching your face, mouth and eyes. Wear a mask when going out in a crowded area or a poorly ventilated indoor space. Avoid crowded places during flu season where the infection can spread quickly. Stay away from people who are sick. Avoid taking antibiotics without your doctor’s prescription If you are sick with the H3N2 flu, avoid heading out in public to prevent the spread of the infection. It is recommended to stay home for at least 24 hours after the fever has subsided. Conclusion H3N2 flu is a serious viral infection that can cause significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in vulnerable populations like the elderly and young children. Since there is no vaccination for H3N2, the best way to prevent the flu and its complications is to use preventative measures, like frequent hand washing and avoiding contact with infected individuals. You can test yourself to see if you are infected with the H3N2 virus. Metropolis Lab's Flu-Xpert Viral Panel uses the real-time Multiplex PCR method to detect 5 strains of flu including Influenza A, Influenza B, H1N1, H3N2 and RSV (Respiratory syncytial virus). It requires only a one-time sample collection and results will be made available within 12 hours.

While there is no foolproof method to avoid it, you can lower your risk by taking precautions. Obtaining a Flu-Xpert Viral Panel test is one approach to protecting yourself. This high-tech test is meant to determine which flu virus strains are present, which can tell you much about your health. This article will cover the fundamentals of the Flu-Xpert Viral Panel test including what it is, how it works and how it may help protect you against the flu. In addition, we will provide information on how to get the test done and answer any questions you may have. Purpose of The Flu-Xpert Viral Panel The Flu-Xpert Viral Panel is an advanced diagnostic tool designed to detect the five main flu virus strains: Influenza A, Influenza B, H1N1, H3N2 and RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus). The symptoms of these viral infections overlap and can be difficult to diagnose. Influenza A is the most common strain of the flu. It is highly contagious and can cause fever, chills, cough and body aches. Influenza B is another common virus strain and can cause symptoms similar to influenza A. H1N1 is a subtype of influenza A and is highly contagious. H3N2 is also a subtype of influenza A and is usually less severe than H1N1. Symptoms include fever, runny nose, dry cough and fatigue. RSV or Respiratory Syncytial Virus has symptoms like cough, runny nose and mild fever. It can sometimes be serious, especially in infants and young children. The Flu-Xpert Viral Panel is a comprehensive test that can identify the various flu virus strains in the patient's body. It is highly accurate, with the sensitivity and specificity of the results being greater than 90%. It is a quick, easy and reliable test that can provide results in a short time. Benefits of the Flu-Xpert Viral Panel When it comes to health and well-being, accuracy is paramount. But knowing the best course of action cannot be easy with various illnesses and treatments. This is where the Flu-Xpert Viral Panel can help. Accurate Diagnosis: The Flu-Xpert Viral Panel considers many factors before providing an accurate diagnosis. This includes the individual’s medical history, current symptoms and laboratory results. Considering these variables, the panel can provide an accurate diagnosis on time. Personalised Treatment: Personalised treatment ensures the patient receives the best care possible. The Flu-Xpert Viral Panel allows doctors to consider the individual’s medical history, symptoms and laboratory results to create a personalised treatment plan tailored to their needs. Easy to Follow Protocol: The Flu-Xpert Viral Panel is easy to follow and the results are available within 12 hours. This makes it easy for healthcare professionals to administer the test and receive the results on time. How The Flu-Xpert Viral Panel is Carried Out? The Flu-Xpert Viral Panel is a quick and easy way to get a reliable result when diagnosing the presence of Influenza. It is a simple test that can be completed in the comfort of your home, providing accurate results quickly. With this test, you can be sure you are getting the best possible care and treatment. Preparation for The Test Preparing for the Flu-Xpert Viral Panel Test involves being aware of how the test is conducted. This test can be done through a nasal or oral swab. A nasal or oral swab may cause some discomfort and itching while the sample is being taken. But these effects are temporary. Don’t hesitate to contact your doctor for advice or questions. Procedure and Analysis of The Test By analyzing nasal or oral swabs, the Flu-Xpert Viral Panel Test can identify the presence and severity of the virus in each sample collection. Nasal or oral swab sample collection is a simple and quick procedure. A swab is carefully inserted into the nostrils or mouth and the collection swab is then sent to the laboratory for analysis. The sample is stored in a sterile container and sent to the laboratory for analysis. Interpretation of Results The Flu-Xpert Viral Panel test results are typically interpreted in terms of virus type, level of infection and severity of symptoms. This test is a reliable and accurate way to find out if it is a virus that is causing your symptoms. If it is, then it will help diagnose the particular strain of the virus as well. The test results can help guide the medical team in determining the best course of treatment for you. Conclusion The Flu-Xpert Viral Panel is a dependable and effective method that detects and identifies influenza viruses rapidly and efficiently. Since the cases of viral infections like H3N2 are increasing, you must take all the precautions to protect yourself and your loved ones. The Flu-Xpert Viral Panel is a thorough screening test done at Metropolis Labs to detect and identify seasonal flu viruses using the highly sophisticated real-time Multiplex PCR method.

ExpertBy IANS23 March, 2023TWC IndiaRepresentational Image(Nitin Sharma/BCCL Chandigarh)Human infections from bird flu are typically rare, but when they happen, it comes with a mortality rate of around 50%, said Vinod Scaria, a biologist, on Wednesday.The latest avian influenza A (H5N1) virus outbreak has killed a record number of birds and also spread to otters, sea lions, foxes, dolphins and seals, among others.Speaking to IANS, Scaria said that the present H5N1 outbreak is largely caused by the 2.3.4.4b lineage of the virus and is probably one of the largest in recent history."In short, typically mammalian spillovers of avian Influenza are rare and typically also lethal," said Vinod, a scientist at CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB)."Since the numbers are large, this provides a unique opportunity for the virus to mutate and adapt to the mammalian host. Apart from affecting the poultry industry, the biggest risk is the extinction of possibly several birds which were already at the edge of extinction," he told IANS.While human cases are rare, an 11-year-old girl in Cambodia died after contracting the avian influenza A (H5N1) virus. The World Health Organisation (WHO) also confirmed a human case of bird flu in a Chinese woman.While the risk of "human-to-human spread is low,"... "further human cases can be expected" until avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, the WHO said."Handling infected birds with adequate precautions would go a big way in minimising human infections," Scaria advised.AdvertisementAccording to media reports, several pharma companies, including Moderna, Sanofi and GSK, are preparing to develop a vaccine against bird flu in case it spills over to humans.Moderna announced successful Phase 1 clinical trial results this week for this flu-fighting mRNA-1440. The vaccine is intended to combat the Influenza Virus H10N8, a strain of bird flu which began commonly appearing in 2014.GSK and CSL Seqirus are developing or are about to test sample human shots. Sanofi is also ready to start producing the jabs if needed, with the help of existing H5N1 vaccine strains they have in stock, media reports said.According to the WHO, from 2003 to 2023, 873 human cases of infection with influenza A (H5N1) and 458 deaths have been reported globally from 21 countries.The WHO has said that available epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that current bird flu viruses have not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans.The agency also advised regular hand washing, good food safety, and hygiene practices. It also stressed the importance of global surveillance to detect and monitor virological, epidemiological, and clinical changes associated with emerging or circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health and timely virus sharing for risk assessment.**The above article has been published from a wire source with minimal modifications to the headline and text.

India is currently seeing a surge in influenza viral infections due to H3N2 and H1N1. Dr. Sunita Kapoor,Director and Consultant Pathologist at City X-ray & Scan Clinic says, “In recent years in which H3N2 is the predominant strain, there have been more hospitalizations. Human infections are primarily acquired through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated environments, these viruses have not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans.”2/7​​People at the highest risk of H3N2:​Young children under age 2Adults older than age 65Residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilitiesPeople who are pregnant or plan to be pregnant during flu seasonPeople with weakened immune systemsPeople who have chronic illnesses, such as asthma, heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease and diabetesHealth care workers performing aerosol generating procedures Travelers to countries and people living in countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza.3/7​​Home care guidelines around H3N2​It is a good idea to keep following common sense flu prevention guidelines, like Regular hand washing with proper drying of the handsGood respiratory hygiene – covering mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, using tissues and disposing of them correctlyEarly self-isolation of those feeling unwell, feverish and having other symptoms of influenzaAvoiding close contact with sick people specially those who are coughing and sneezingAvoiding touching one’s eyes, nose or mouthIt’s best to get your flu shot before the peak flu season4/7​​What to eat what to avoid​Dr. Kapoor says, “Body needs good nutrition to recover from the flu. One might not have much of an appetite, but it’s still important to eat regular meals to maintain your strength. Fresh fruits and vegetables provide important vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that strengthen your immune system as it fights off the virus. Also the body needs plenty of fluids to replace lost liquids, and even more to fight off the infection. Water is best, but you can also drink herbal teas or tea with honey. Few foods to be avoided are heavy, greasy foods, such as fried or fast foods.”5/7​​How many days do the symptoms persist?​Symptoms of H3N2 tend to be the same as other forms of the flu. These can include:fever or feeling feverishcoughsore throatrunny or stuffy nosemuscle or body achesheadachesfatigueVomiting and diarrhea (more common in children than adults)Conjunctivitis“In case of flu, a dry cough usually starts after a fever and can last for a long time. The cough is very strong and it is taking 10 to 12 days to get cured. While earlier, fever usually lasted for 3-4 days, but in these cases, the fever is not getting cured even in 6-7 days. In some patients getting infected with H3N2 virus, more infection is spreading in lungs and this can lead to pneumonia, leading to cough, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing.If the condition worsens, hospitalization becomes necessary, often in elderly or young children,” Dr. Kapoor told TOI.Fatigue, lethargy and extreme weakness are frequent H3N2 symptoms. These may persist for several weeks even after the other symptoms have subsided. Patients may also experience severe and long-lasting body pain, particularly in the back, arms, and legs6/7​​How to get better soon​Stay indoorsHydrateSleep as much as possibleEase your breathing using humidifier or vaporizer in the roomEat healthy foodsTake medications as per doctors advicePain relievers Decongestants, Cough suppressants, Expectorants Antihistamines Ask your doctor about antiviral drugsGet a flu shot​Also Read: How to know if it's COVID XBB 1.16 infection or H3N2 infection?​7/7​​How to cure the fatigue that happens after it​Some lifestyle tips may help post-viral fatigue syndrome.

H3N2 infection cases are increasing at a rapid rate in the country. Read on to know how it can impact your kidneys and what you can do to protect yourself. If you often indulge in pee-gasms, your kidneys might be at risk. Image courtesy: Freepik Published by Arushi Bidhuri Published On: 21 Mar 2023, 03:39 pm IST 187 Channel ChannelIndia is witnessing a fresh surge in H3N2 cases, with Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat, and Delhi on high alert. While the majority of cases out of the total cases of H3N2 influenza identified in the country have been mild, the government has issued an advisory to take appropriate measures. As per reports, adults over the age of 65, children, and other immunocompromised people are more vulnerable to the infection. In fact, people with kidney patients are also at a higher risk, says an expert.Healthshots asked Dr Saurabh Joshi, Senior Consultant and Head, Urology, Uro-oncology, and Kidney Transplant, Accord Hospital, Faridabad, Delhi NCR, to understand the link between kidney disease and the H3N2 virus.Does the H3N2 virus affect your kidneys?H3N2 is a type of influenza virus that can cause severe respiratory illness, particularly in people who are immunocompromised or have underlying health conditions. While influenza is not typically known to have direct effects on the kidneys, complications from the virus can lead to acute kidney injury in some cases, says Dr Joshi.Complications of H3N2 virus you should know. Image courtesy: Adobe StockFor dialysis patients, who are already at an increased risk for influenza complications due to their weakened immune system and underlying health conditions, H3N2 infection can be particularly challenging. Dialysis patients require regular treatments to filter waste products from their blood since their kidneys don’t functioning properly. If they contract influenza, their immune systems may not be able to fight off the virus effectively, leading to more severe illness and potentially life-threatening complications.Also Read: Symptoms and precautions of H3N2 virus to knowOne of the potential complications of H3N2 infection in dialysis patients is acute kidney injury or AKI, which is a sudden loss of kidney function. AKI can be caused by a variety of factors, including infections, medications, and other health conditions. In the case of H3N2 infection, the virus can cause inflammation throughout the body, including in the kidneys, which can lead to acute kidney injury, adds the expert.Symptoms of kidney injurySince acute kidney injury is the major complication that could stem from an H3N2 infection, it is best to know the symptoms of the disease to get timely treatment. As per the expert, the symptoms of acute kidney injury can include decreased urine output, fluid retention, and swelling in the legs, ankles, or feet. In severe cases, acute kidney injury can lead to electrolyte imbalances, seizures, or coma. Treatment for acute kidney injury may include medications to manage electrolyte imbalances, as well as dialysis to help remove waste products from the blood and restore kidney function.How can you prevent infection from the H3N2 virus?Your best defence against the H3N2 virus and complications like acute kidney injury is getting vaccinated annually, ideally before the start of the flu season. As for dialysis patients, Dr Joshi advises that they should consult with their healthcare provider to determine the best course of action. Apart from vaccination, kidney patients on dialysis should practice good hygiene, such as washing their hands, avoiding close contact with sick people and wearing a mask in public places.Avoid crowded places to avoid H3N2 infection. Image Courtesy: ShutterstockIn case a dialysis patient contracts H3N2 influenza, they should seek prompt medical attention to prevent complications. Dr Joshi says, “Antiviral medications may be prescribed to reduce the severity and duration of the illness, and close monitoring for signs of acute kidney injury is important. If acute kidney injury does occur, prompt treatment is necessary to prevent further damage to the kidneys and other organs.”TakeawayWhile there are no known side effects of the H3N2 virus on the kidneys, complications like acute kidney injury can happen, especially in patients on dialysis. Vaccination and good hygiene are the best ways to prevent infection. If H3N2 infection does occur in a patient with kidney disease, prompt medical attention is required to avoid further complications that may sabotage your overall health.Get latest updates on health and wellness along with Health News About The Author Arushi Bidhuri Arushi Bidhuri is a journalist with 7 years of experience in writing, editing, and conceptualizing story ideas across different genres, including health and wellness, lifestyle, politics, beauty, fashion, and more.

(Source: Reuters/Marco Bello) Amid a spurt in Covid-19 cases, influenza, and other respiratory infections in the national capital, private hospitals and laboratories are offering comprehensive packages to eliminate the need for repeated testing.Influenza, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus, among others, usually share common symptoms like cough, runny nose and fever, and many times a single test does not diagnose the disease.The Indian Council of Medical Research said the rise in influenza cases is due to the Influenza A subtype H3N2 virus. Hospitals across the country have been reporting a large number of influenza cases over the past few months.India generally sees two peaks of seasonal influenza, from January to March and the post-monsoon season."Taking into account the significant increase in viral infections in the city, we have launched a multiplex PCR-based comprehensive flu panel which comprises 17 pathogens, including all common viruses such as Covid, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, metapneumovirus, adenovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, RSV, and others," said Arjun Dang, CEO and Partner of Dr Dangs Lab. The pathology lab also offers a comprehensive respiratory panel that tests for 22 pathogens, including common bacteria and all the common circulating strains of viruses causing the current outbreak of flu. "The advantage is that these tests give the results in just a few hours, are highly sensitive and are not affected by any antibiotics the patient may have taken prior to the test as they detect the nucleic acid of the pathogen," he said.Based on the results, timely clinical decisions can be made along with a rationalised usage of antibiotics and antivirals."These panels have a significant impact on patients as they provide a diagnosis in most cases, eliminating the need for repeated testing. The sample type required for these tests is a nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab, which is similar to that required for Covid-19 testing," Dang said.Seeds of Innocence IVF Clinics and Genestrings Diagnostic Centre have also been offering an array of diagnostic tests for influenza-like illnesses. Chetan Kohli, COO, Seeds of Innocence IVF Clinics and Genestrings Diagnostic Centre, said, "We are offering an array of tests for the last three to four weeks. These tests are expensive ones, priced at Rs 5,000 per panel, and the requests that we are getting are from hospitals. We are testing 30-odd samples every day."Dr. Nilesh Shah, President and Chief of Science and Innovation at Metropolis Healthcare, said, "Our Covi-Influenza Viral Panel, which covers tests such as Influenza A, Influenza B, H1N1, H3N2, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19), is Rs 5500, and the only flu panel is Rs 4500. The patients opt for the tests through doctor's recommendations."Watch LIVE TV, Get Stock Market Updates, Top Business, IPO and Latest News on NDTV Profit.ADVERTISEMENT EnglishहिंदीEnglish|हिंदीSubscribe at ₹7/dayWatch LIVEGet Unlimited AccessSubscribe at just ₹7/daySubscribeGet in TouchEditorial Feedbackprofiteditor@ndtv.com Salesprofitsales@ndtv.com Subscription Queriesprofitsupport@ndtv.com For any ComplaintsGet In Touch Get In TouchEditorial Feedback profiteditor@ndtv.comSubscription Queries profitsupport@ndtv.comSales profitsales@ndtv.comFor Any Complaints Get In TouchNDTV ProfitTrending NowExclusivesToday's LatestBusinessMarketsNifty FuturesEconomy & FinanceLaw & PolicyVideosPersonal FinanceOpinionPoliticsLearningTechnologyPursuitsBrand StudioCalculatorsWeb StoriesShow All SectionsNDTV ProfitTrending NowExclusivesToday's LatestBusinessMarketsNifty FuturesEconomy & FinanceLaw & PolicyVideosPersonal FinanceOpinionPoliticsLearningTechnologyPursuitsBrand StudioCalculatorsWeb StoriesStay UpdatedNewsletterTelegramPodcastsWhatsappThe Daily NewsletterSIGN UPView All NewslettersFollow UsNote : All Stock Exchange data is delayed upto 3 minsDOWNLOAD THE APPAbout usTerms of UsePrivacy PolicySitemapRSSAbout usTerms of UsePrivacy PolicySitemapRSS2024 © NDTV Profit.

Prime minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday chaired a high-level meeting on Covid-19 and influenza to review the country’s response and preparedness to deal with a rising number of cases of influenza and a slight increase in the number of Covid-19 cases. Prime Minister Narendra Modi chairs a high-level meeting to review the Covid situation, in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI) The Prime Minister directed officials to enhance genome sequencing while also emphasising on the need to ensure people strictly adhere to Covid-appropriate behavior, according to a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). In the week ended March 22, India reported a daily average of 888 cases according to the Union health ministry, with a positivity rate of 0.98%. The numbers are not alarming by themselves and some experts believe that more people are testing themselves because of a flu virus that is going around, and that some of them are testing positive for Covid-19. According to the latest genome sequencing data from INSACOG, the consortium of labs responsible for genome sequencing in India, the dominant strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus doing the rounds now is XBB, which is believed to be highly infectious, but not lethal. “Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi today chaired a high-level meeting to assess the Covid-19 and Influenza situation in the country in terms of preparedness of health infrastructure and logistics, status of the vaccination campaign, emergence of new Covid-19 variants and Influenza types and their public health implications for the country,” read the PMO statement. On Wednesday India recorded 1,134 new coronavirus cases and five deaths. Doctors are more concerned by influenza, which has laid many people low, sometimes for as long as a month, primarily because of their lower immunity following an attack of Covid-19. Flu shots are also not common in India, although doctors have been encouraging people to take an annual one. During the meeting, the health secretary, Rajesh Bhushan, made a comprehensive presentation covering the global Covid situation . The prime minister also reviewed the progress made since the last review meeting on December 22, 2022. He was informed that availability and prices of 20 main Covid drugs, 12 other drugs, eight buffer drugs and one influenza drug were being monitored. The prime minister was apprised on the influenza situation in the country particularly with respect to higher number of cases of H1N1 and H3N2 being noted in last few months. Modi directed officials to enhance whole genome sequencing of positive samples with the designated INSACOG genome sequencing laboratories. The prime minister emphasized the need to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour including wearing of masks in hospital premises by both patients, health professionals, and health workers. He also stressed that wearing of masks is advisable when senior citizens and those with co-morbidities visit crowded areas. “In my clinical practice, almost all my patients acquired infections by going to large gatherings, flights etc. where there is high potential for exposure. The susceptible population, especially elderly and immunocompromised, should avoid crowded places and take flu vaccine in time,” said Dr GC Khilnani, chairman, PSRI Institute of Pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine.

Meanwhile, the Delhi government issued an advisory urging people to take precautionary measures like avoiding crowded places, maintaining arm-distance from infected persons and washing hands. The Health Ministry instructed hospitals, healthcare centers, and surveillance units to monitor cases closely and spread awareness with the help of advertisements through newspapers and FM radio in the national capital. At present, around 20 cases are being seen in Lok Nayak Hospital everyday and 7-8 cases in other hospitals, said the Health Ministry.

Following the instructions of UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, the Directorate of Urban Bodies has issued directions to all stakeholders including officers of all Municipal bodies, Municipal Commissioners and Jalkal department. The awareness drive is slated to kick off from April 1 in order to control communicable diseases.

Also ReadMenace of H3N2 influenza rising in India; Here are the latest updates What is H3N2? H3N2 is an influenza virus which spreads from pigs to humans. H3N2 is a subtype of influenza A virus after H1N1. It is highly contagious that spreads from one person to another. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the virus was first identified in US pigs in 2010. People of all-age groups could be vulnerable to H3N2. Elderly patients with comorbidities need to be more careful. What health experts say According to health experts, these viruses generally spread during weather changes as viruses find conducive time to multiply and transmit among people rapidly. The infection of H3N2 virus may continue for five to seven days. People generally take a week to recover while in some patients, recovery period has been seen 10 to 12 days. Doctors and health specialists are of the view that the rising cases of H3N2 influenza is not a cause of concern, but people are advised to stay safe. People are advised not to panic but they should follow Covid pandemic protocols. Maintaining basic health hygiene, social distancing, avoiding crowded places, wearing masks, getting sound sleep, eating balanced diets, staying hydrated, practicing Yoga and physical work-out will enable a person to keep the flu at bay. Symptomatic treatment Medically, a symptomatic treatment is recommended to ease symptoms like fever, cough and nasal congestion. Adequate rest with home-cooked fresh food and proper hydration is deemed to be the best medicine to get recovery. However, painkillers, paracetamol, cough suppressants and nebulizers are recommended by doctors to give relief to patients. Common symptoms It is quite difficult to differentiate the symptoms between Covid and flu. There are some common symptoms seen in both patients of Covid and flu: sore throat, cough, headache, body ache, weakness, tiredness and fever. As per health experts, H3N2 can cause throat hoarseness, while in the case of Covid 19 a patient could have a fever or stuffy nose. In the flu, a patient could feel intense body ache and dry cough could last for a longer period. In Covid 19 patients, loss of smell and taste could be seen with rashes on the body. Prevention: WHO WHO underlines the famous maxim: “Prevention is better than cure.” According to the World Health Organisation, vaccination is the most effective way to prevent the flu disease. Vaccines are safe and effective, which have been used for more than 60 years. Inoculation is recommended annually to protect against influenza as body immunity gained from vaccination goes down over time. WHO says that vaccination is quite important for people at high risk of influenza complications.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) National Veterinary Services Laboratory has also confirmed the outbreak. DEC initiated an investigation into suspicious deaths at the Game Farm, located near Ithaca in Tompkins County, on March 20. Initial test results indicated a possible outbreak of the H5N1 avian influenza (AI) virus. On March 21, the farm was put under quarantine following positive test results from the Cornell Wildlife Health Lab. This week, at least 500 of DEC’s breeder flock of 6,600 pheasants died from HPAI.As part of standard HPAI response protocols, DEC is working closely with animal health experts at the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets (AGM) and the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratory. The remaining breeder flock of pheasants on the property is being depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from the flocks will not enter the food system. Cooperatively managed by DEC, AGM, and USDA, additional surveillance and testing will be conducted in areas around the affected flock. The USDA response plan can be found at USDA APHIS | Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI).The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that the recent HPAI detections in birds do not present an immediate public health concern. HPAI cases in humans are rare, and symptoms are typically mild. The risk of a person becoming infected is low.DEC will continue to work with partners at AGM and USDA to respond to the outbreak thoroughly and swiftly.Get the latest headlines delivered to your inbox each morning.

They are in home isolation at present, according to the health department. Image used for representative purpose only GURGAON: The city on Monday recorded two cases of type-B influenza virus, a man and a woman, both 32 years old. They are in home isolation at present, according to the health department.Surveillance teams have tested 156 people with flu-like symptoms so far and found three of them positive for influenza, of whom one has H3N2 (a four-year-old boy). There are four types of influenza - A (of which H3N2 is a subtype), B, C and D.Anyone infected must take precautions, especially wearing a mask, health officials said. So far, four type-B influenza cases and one H3N2 infections have been reported in the city. "Two new cases were identified on Monday. At present, a 11-month-old girl is admitted in PGIMS Rohtak. The rest are stable and in home isolation. All contacts of positive cases have tested negative," said Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer, adding that the fifth case - a 56-year-old man - was reported by a private hospital.Covid cases are also witnessing a slight rise, according to doctors, who said people must remain vigilant and try to prevent the spread of the virus by wearing masks, adhering to social distancing norms and practising hand hygiene.Experts are of the opinion that the rise in Covid cases is because of the flu, due to which people are getting tested for the coronavirus as well. The city recorded 13 new Covid cases on Monday. The number of active cases is now 43, while the positivity rate is 0.8%. Four patients recovered from the infection on Monday. The health department collected 1,577 samples for Covid testing on Monday. Meanwhile, 21 patients tested positive in the state on Monday. Haryana now has 67 active patients, while the positivity rate is 1% and the recovery rate is 98.9%. A total of 2,493 samples were collected for antigen and RT-PCR tests. So far, 10,56,868 people have tested positive in Haryana, while 10,714 have died since the pandemic started.How H3N2, Covid and common cold differThe three infections have symptoms that are almost the same, but with varying intensities. According to experts, H3N2 usually starts with a sore throat, while in Covid, the initial symptoms are fever or a stuffy nose. Common cold starts with sneezing and sore throat, but the patient doesn't get fever and the infection starts easing up within three to five days, while H3N2 patients have fever, body ache and dry cough, which lasts for a longer period than usual (up to three weeks). In Covid, apart from fever and cough, patients also suffer from shortness of breath, which may be reported by H3N2 patients, but not common cold. Patients with H3N2 generally report fatigue and headaches, but the patients don't suffer from loss of taste and smell, unlike Covid."We have seen an increase in influenza and Covid cases in recent weeks. Due to changes in weather and failure to adhere to social distancing and wearing of masks, these infections are rising. The infection spreads through respiratory droplets. We have seen an increase in H3N2 infection, which is the most common. In a majority of cases, we are not observing any serious issues, but in senior citizens with asthma, COPD, diabetes and renal failure, we are observing some serious complications like lack of oxygen and pneumonia," said Dr Amitabha Ghosh, consultant (internal medicine), Manipal Hospital.He added that a doctor should be consulted in case fever persists beyond six days and there is wheezing or breathlessness. "Antibiotics are not required in most cases, so use them only as directed by a doctor. We are also advising people to take the flu vaccine," Ghosh added.End of ArticleFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories Previous10 reasons to have 1 pomegranate dailyLifestyleScenic hill station train journeys in North IndiatravelIndiaâs famous tigers and tigresses: The legends of the wildtravelTips for guiding your child to greater happinessLifestyleHow to make South Indian-Style Mysore Masala Dosa at homeFood'Stree 2, 'Aashiqui' and other films of Shraddha Kapoor to watchEntertainmentAI imagines how India's top metros will look like in the next 50 yearsLifestyle15 Indian states and the rice dishes they are famous forFoodHow to extract, store, and apply fresh Aloe Vera to aid hair growthLifestyle8 hybrid animals that were âinventedâ by humansLifestyle Next123Hot PicksArvind Kejriwal Resignation LiveAssassination of Donald Trump LiveHaryana Election 2024 LiveRyan Wesley RouthRenukaswamy Murder CaseHarvest Moon Lunar EclipseUPI Transaction LimitTOP TRENDINGPapua New GuineaMonday Night RawShimla Mosque ProtestsGK for StudentsSuper Bowl HalftimePrincess Diana BrotherKolkata Rape CaseVince McMahonHamster Kombat Daily Cipher CodesElon MuskTrending StoriesIn CityEntire WebsiteMonster vs Monster: WWE announced massive match for this week's Monday Night RawUPI transaction limit to change from September 16!

Getting ready for the flu season: Vaccinate, please! 29 April 2024 Why are you vaccinated with the influenza vaccine? The effectiveness of influenza (flu) vaccines has been found to vary between 40-60%. This means that, on average, a vaccinated person is 40-60% less likely to experience the flu leading to a visit to a general practice (GP) or hospital. These figures come from hospital and health services rather than manufacturers. You may think this figure is lower than desirable; however, if these statistics were about heart conditions, you might happily follow the advice. When vaccinated, you are less likely to become infected and, if you do become infected, you are more likely to only have a mild dose of the flu. ‘Vaccine impact‘ is the reduction of the flu occurring in a population due to the vaccine. Vaccine impact includes indirect protection that you add to others by being vaccinated. As more people are vaccinated, there is less virus circulating in the community and less risk of acquiring infection. ​This is known as ‘herd immunity’. What are the consequences of influenza? The graph below, from a study that analysed Australian hospital records from 2007 to 2015, highlights the severe consequences of flu – respiratory death and distress causing hospitalisation. While these statistics may seem dated the current pattern of hospitalisations and death are the same today. Excess respiratory mortality and hospitalizations associated with influenza in Australia, 2007–2015. International Journal of Epidemiology, Vol. 51 Symptoms Milder symptoms of influenza include: Fever Dry, chesty cough Headache Tiredness Chills Aching muscles Limb or joint pain Diarrhoea or upset stomach Sore throat Runny or blocked nose Sneezing Loss of appetite Fact: Nine out of 10 people hospitalised with influenza have at least one underlying health condition. Diabetes is considered an underlying health condition. Fact: Complicated hospitaliation occurred in 10.6% of influenza-positive patients. Diabetes was second only to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as a condition that negatively influences the length and outcome of influenza. What can you do in addition to vaccination? Keep your glucose levels in the recommended range as much as possible. High glucose levels impair your body’s immune reaction to viruses. They also increase the likelihood of secondary bacterial infections and will delay your recovery. Take precautions such as wearing a mask, hand washing, using hand sanitiser and social distancing during peak influenza season. Who is eligible for a free vaccine this year? Under the National Immunisation Program (NIP), in all states: Pregnant women (at any stage of pregnancy) People aged six months and over with certain medical conditions see below* Children six months to less than five years People aged 65 years and older Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged 6 months and over *People with certain medical conditions are more likely to have complications and being hospitalised from flu. These medical conditions include: Cardiac disease Chronic respiratory conditions (including severe asthma) Chronic neurological conditions that increase the risk of respiratory infection (including hereditary and degenerative central nervous system diseases and seizure disorders) Immunocompromising conditions (including immunocompromised due to disease or treatment) Diabetes and other metabolic disorders Renal disease Haematological disorders (including haemoglobinopathies) Children aged six months to 10 years on long term aspirin therapy who are at increased risk of Reye syndrome following influenza infection. State funded extra eligibility is available in: Queensland and Western Australia for all people over the age of six months In South Australia there is an influenza program for people experiencing homelessness. Which vaccines are funded and recommended for my age? All people > 6 monthsAll people aged ≥5 years onlyAdults ≥60 years only Adults ≥65 years onlyFluarix Tetra Flucelvax Quad FluQuadri Influvac Tetra Vaxigrip TetraAlfuria QuadFluzone High-Dose QuadrivalentFluad Quad (1) What else should I know? Contraindications: The only contraindications to influenza vaccines are: Anaphylaxis following a previous dose of any influenza vaccine Anaphylaxis following any vaccine component (excluding eggs). Egg allergy: This is not a contraindication to influenza vaccines. If there is significant parental or health professional concern, the vaccine may be administered in a primary care setting with a longer waiting period of 30 minutes. Latex allergy: All influenza vaccines available under the NIP in 2024 are latex-free, and people with a latex allergy can safely be vaccinated. What strains are in this year’s vaccine? The egg-based trivalent influenza vaccines contain the following three viral strains: an A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus an A/Thailand/8/2022 (H3N2)-like virus a B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus. Cell-based trivalent influenza vaccines contain the following three viral strains: an A/Wisconsin/67/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus an A/Massachusetts/18/2022 (H3N2)-like virus a B/Austria/1359417/2021 (B/Victoria lineage)-like virus. Quadrivalent egg- or cell culture-based or recombinant vaccines contain the following B/Yamagata lineage component: a B/Phuket/3073/2013 (B/Yamagata lineage)-like virus. (2) When should I get my vaccination? Anyone who is planning international travel should have their vaccination before leaving Australia. While protection is generally expected to last throughout the year, the highest level of protection occurs in the first three to four months after vaccination. The period of peak influenza circulation is typically June to September in most parts of Australia. The warmer the Australian state, the later the peak season. Vaccination from mid-April onwards will likely result in peak immunity during the influenza season. However, it’s never too late to vaccinate, as influenza can spread all year round. Where do you receive free vaccines under the National immunisation program (NIP)? Doctor’s surgeries and hospital and health services Any pharmacy that has registered as a provider of NIP vaccines Please check for any additional costs for this service before you book.

Read on to find out H3N2 Influenza Outbreak in India: Viral infections can cause direct effects on the male reproductive system as well as systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, which can negatively impact sperm quality. Written by Sushmita Panda March 20, 2023 13:45 IST Follow Us H3N2 influenza and other viral infections currently prevalent in India may have similar effects on male fertility and sperm quality. (Image Credit: Pixabay) H3N2 Influenza Outbreak in India: The incidence of infertility is rising across the world. Studies suggest that one of the possible reasons for this rising infertility cases is declining sperm count. According to a study published in the journal Human Reproduction Update last year, the decline in men’s reproductive function could “threaten mankind’s survival.” Last month, a team of scientists led by AIIMS Patna found that COVID-19 infection has a negative impact on semen quality and sperm DNA fragmentation index. According to the researchers, the infection causes a potential sperm damage. The study, published in the Cureus Journal of Medical Science, revealed that in the first sampling, semen volume, vitality, total motility, sperm concentration, and total sperm count were significantly lower.Also Read Do you need an angiogram? Signs and symptoms that lead to this test One-third Indians with obesity fail to recognise their condition, widespread misconception leading to delayed treatment EXPLAINER | Why doctors want changes in the anti-sex detection law How effective are flu shots in protecting you from seasonal coughs and colds? Doctors explain Can H3N2 influenza affect your sperm count? The number of H3N2 cases is rapidly rising in the country. Just like COVID-19 is a viral infection, Influenza A virus subtype H3N2 is a subtype of viruses that causes influenza. “…It is a subtype of Influenza A virus which causes seasonal flu and this is usually prevalent from January to March and post monsoon. As the summer begins, it should probably taper down by March end or early April. That said, it is important to remember that H3N2 is known to produce variants and we will probably have to wait and see how this progresses,” Dr C M A Belliappa, Consultant Medical Director, Practo told Financial Express.com. On Sunday, over 400 cases of the virus have been detected in India so far – with Jharkhand reporting the latest case. Can H3N2 have a similar impact on male fertility like COVID-19? “There is currently limited research available on the specific impact of H3N2 influenza and other viral infections on male fertility and sperm in India. However, some general information can be provided on the effects of viral infections on male fertility. Male fertility and sperm quality can be negatively affected by viral infections. Viruses such as the mumps virus can cause inflammation of the testicles (orchitis) and decrease sperm production. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can also affect sperm quality and fertility by causing immune dysfunction and systemic inflammation,” Dr. Souren Bhattacharjee, Consultant Birla Fertility & IVF told Financial Express.com. Also ReadH3N2 influenza: Around 450 cases reported in India so far, death toll reaches 9 – WHO says what about the flu According to Dr. Bhattacharjee, H3N2 influenza and other viral infections currently prevalent in India may have similar effects on male fertility and sperm quality. Viral infections can cause direct effects on the male reproductive system as well as systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, which can negatively impact sperm quality. “When trying to conceive, men should practice good hygiene and avoid contact with sick people to avoid viral infections. It is important for men who become infected with a viral illness to seek medical treatment and to follow any recommendations made by their IVF specialist for managing the infection and minimizing its effects on fertility,” he added. According to Dr Kshitiz Murdia – CEO & Co-Founder of Indira IVF, Influenza virus and other infection-causing viruses are not able to directly invade the male reproductive system however, through the fevers associated with them, it has been found that such viruses can temporarily lower sperm production. “The human testes are located outside the body in a way that they are 2-3˚C cooler compared to the rest of the human body which is ideal for the production of sperm. With an increase in body temperature due to fever, there is a decrease in sperm count due to unfavourable conditions for their production. Additionally, fever can damage the DNA and proteins constituted in sperms, leading to the production of aberrant sperm and their lower motility. This is true for the common viral infections that are prevalent in India including Influenza A, Influenza B, H1N1, H3N2 as well as different strains of SARS-CoV-2,” Dr. Murdia told Financial Express.com. However, Dr. Murdia also reiterated that such changes in sperm production and factors are temporary. “However, in terms of the coronavirus disease, a study conducted by AIIMS has found that semen quality remained poor even after 3.5 months of COVID-19 infection; it has thus, become essential to check the semen parameters in males with a history of COVID-19 if/when they approach hospitals that provide assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatments,” he added. ‘Not many studies to backup the effect of sperm count’ According to Dr Archna Dhawan Bajaj, Gynaecologist, Nurture IVF, H3N2 viruses in the currently pertinent viruses are all giving short duration diseases. “They are not many studies to backup the effect of sperm count on their effect on sperm count and infertility, however, since they are debilitating and acute illnesses with high grade fever, Loss of appetite, Loose motions, breathlessness, difficulty in breathing etc. They may have a short term impact on male infertility. Perhaps, they will lead to decrease in sperm counts transiently impacting their forms that are man that are synthesised in the testes around the time of the disease,” Dr. Bajaj told Financial Express.com. According to Dr. Bajaj, the long term impact is yet to be studied. “However as of all viral illnesses which are acute and debilitating, there may be some impact on male infertility,” she added. Dr. Murdia also pointed out that the evidence on the specific impact of H3N2 on male fertility and semen parameters are currently scarce. “Moreover, most of the studies done on the impact of viruses (such as H1N1) on the male reproductive system have been primarily done in animal models. Thus, these aspects need to be studied further over a period of time to derive a strong conclusion,” he added. ‘Cases have been reported of viral orchitis-like symptoms’ Dr. Shivani Sachdev Gour, Director of SCI Healthcare, Gynecologist and IVF expert told Financial Express.com that Seasonal flu infections happen every year worldwide. and some cases have been reported of viral orchitis-like symptoms. Orchitis is a condition in which there is inflammation of the testicle unilaterally or bilaterally usually caused by viruses and bacteria. “Seasonal flu are known to reduce male fertility temporarily due to the fever associated with the illness. In one case study, a patient recovering from influenza produced normal sperm again 45 days post fever. Characteristics of human sperm chromatin structure following an episode of influenza and high fever, a case study. In another study, sperm count, motility and genetic health began to improve in the 50-70 days after the patient’s fever resolved. High risk of temporary alteration of semen parameters after recent acute febrile illness. There is good evidence the effects in short term,” Dr. Gour told Financial Express.com. According to Dr. Shobha Subramanian-Itolikar, Consultant-Internal Medicine, Fortis Hospital Mulund, it has been known that Mumps virus and Zika virus affect the cellular function of the male internal reproductive organ, that is testes, there by permanently impacting male fertility. “There were some reports of male infertility caused due to Influenza viruses. But over time and after research, it has been clear that these viruses cause a temporary defect in the sperm quality and quantity because of the inflammatory substances released during the active infection. So far there are no established reports of any long-lasting male fertility issues due to Influenza, Parainfluenza or Corona viruses. Large studies should be planned for unearthing more facts,” Dr. Subramanian-Itolikar told Financial Express.com.

However, doctors have pointed out some differences that can help people tell if they have flu or Covid-19.AgenciesReports say that the H3N2 flu virus is spreading in India, and people are worried that it will make people sick and spread further. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare says that the number of cases of seasonal flu should go down by the end of March.It is important to note, however, that H3N2 is a seasonal flu virus that has been circulating for many years and is not a new sub-variant that emerged following COVID-19.While the most common symptoms of H3N2 are fever and cough, it can still cause serious complications, particularly in vulnerable populations such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions.The distinction between COVID-19 and H3N2COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, whereas H3N2 is an influenza virus strain. COVID-19 is more contagious than H3N2, with symptoms ranging from mild to severe. COVID-19 can also make people lose their sense of smell or taste, which is not a sign of H3N2.Web DevelopmentA Comprehensive ASP.NET Core MVC 6 Project Guide for 2024By - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Data ScienceSQL Server Bootcamp 2024: Transform from Beginner to ProBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Office ProductivityAdvanced Excel Course - Financial Calculations & Excel Made EasyBy - Anirudh Saraf, Founder- Saraf A & Associates, Chartered AccountantView Program MarketingPerformance Marketing for eCommerce BrandsBy - Zafer Mukeri, Founder- Inara MarketersView Program FinanceFinancial Literacy i.e Lets Crack the Billionaire CodeBy - CA Rahul Gupta, CA with 10+ years of experience and Accounting EducatorView Program AstrologyVastu Shastra CourseBy - Sachenkumar Rai, Vastu ShashtriView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)AI-Powered Python Mastery with Tabnine: Boost Your Coding SkillsBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program FinanceFinancial Literacy for Non-Finance ExecutivesBy - CA Raja, Chartered Accountant | Financial Management Educator | Former AVP - Credit, SBIView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)Master in Python Language Quickly Using the ChatGPT Open AIBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Web DevelopmentIntermediate Java Mastery: Method, Collections, and BeyondBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)AI for Everyone: Understanding and Applying the Basics on Artificial IntelligenceBy - Ritesh Vajariya, Generative AI ExpertView Program Web DevelopmentIntermediate C++ Skills: Master Pointers, Structures and File StreamBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program MarketingModern Marketing Masterclass by Seth GodinBy - Seth Godin, Former dot com Business Executive and Best Selling AuthorView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)Java Programming with ChatGPT: Learn using Generative AIBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Artificial Intelligence(AI)Tabnine AI Masterclass: Optimize Your Coding EfficiencyBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program Web DevelopmentAdvanced C++ Mastery: OOPs and Template TechniquesBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program FinanceA2Z Of MoneyBy - elearnmarkets, Financial Education by StockEdgeView Program FinanceAI and Generative AI for FinanceBy - Hariom Tatsat, Vice President- Quantitative Analytics at BarclaysView Program Web DevelopmentJava 21 Essentials for Beginners: Build Strong Programming FoundationsBy - Metla Sudha Sekhar, IT Specialist and DeveloperView Program FinanceA2Z Of Finance: Finance Beginner CourseBy - elearnmarkets, Financial Education by StockEdgeView Program COVID-19 can also cause more serious complications like pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multi-organ failure.H3N2, on the other hand, can also cause severe complications, but it is usually less severe than COVID-19.Can H3N2 cause the next pandemic?According to media reports, a virus’s ability to cause a pandemic is determined by a variety of factors, including its ability to spread easily from person to person, the severity, and the availability of effective treatments and vaccines. Although H3N2 is not as contagious as COVID-19, it can still spread quickly and cause serious illness and death, as seen in previous influenza pandemics.Even though COVID-19 and H3N2 have some things in common, having COVID-19 does not mean that you are more likely to get H3N2, and there is no proof that the two are related.FAQs Q1: What are the H3N2 virus symptoms?The H3N2 influenza virus has typical flu symptoms, such as cough, congestion in the throat, respiratory tract, and lungs, sore throat, fever, headache, chills, body ache, and fatigue.Q2: Which virus is H3N2?It is a subvariant of the influenza A virus.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Disclaimer Statement: This content is authored by a 3rd party.

Doctors said that at present, H1N1 is turning out to be more of a concern than Covid-19, with many H1N1 patients needing hospitalization and ICU admission.In 21 days of March 2023, Kerala has reported 68 H1N1 cases and four deaths, which is more than double of what was reported in January and February this year.In January, the state reported 15 H1N1 cases and two deaths. The cases jumped to 27 in February, but there was only one death due to H1N1, as per data from Directorate of Health Services (DHS), Kerala.In other words, in less than three months, Kerala has reported 110 H1N1 cases and seven deaths. In contrast, between January and December 2022, there were 90 cases and seven deaths due to H1N1. There were 13,202 reported H1NI cases, with 410 deaths in the country last year.âAt the moment, H1N1 is dominant here. But we have been seeing all influenza cases â influenza A variants H1N1, H3N2 and influenza B variants â Victoria and Yamagata lineages and the dominance trend varies seasonally,â said Dr Anoop Kumar, critical care physician at Baby Memorial Hospital, Kozhikode, who won Kerala governmentâs special award for his efforts to identify and prevent the Nipah virus outbreak in the state in 2018.The H1N1 flu is primarily caused by the H1N1 strain of the flu (influenza) virus and is a type of influenza A virus. Symptoms of H1N1 flu are the same as those of seasonal flu or Covid-19, with people complaining of fever (but not always), cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, red or watery eyes, body aches, headache, fatigue, diarrhoea or/and nausea and vomiting about one to three days after one is exposed to the virus. Any person who comes with these symptoms to the hospital is now being screened for influenza virus A and B, as well as Covid-19.âH1N1 is turning out to be more dangerous than the present Covid-19 variant, with patients developing pneumonia and other complications and needing ICU support,â said Dr M I Sahadulla, chairman and managing director, KIMS Healthcare Group and president, Association of Healthcare Providers India (Kerala chapter).Medical experts said it is important that people above the age of 65, those with existing co-morbidities and healthcare workers take the yearly flu vaccine to protect against the influenza virus.About the AuthorPreetu NairPreetu Nair, Deputy metro editor at The Times of India, Kochi, writes on crime and health, and issues related to women and children.

Telegram Facebook Copy Link ETHealthWorld Updated On Mar 21, 2023 at 12:47 PM IST Read by: 100 Industry Professionals Read by 100 Industry Professionals By Prathiba Raju and Abhishek BhatiaNew Delhi: As India is witnessing a rise in COVID-19 cases, the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) has revised guidelines for the public to effectively tackle and manage the disease. The country had crossed over 1,000 positive SARS-CoV-2 cases on Sunday after almost four and a half months.The last time that peak occurred was when the Omicron BF.7 variant was detected in December 2022. According to the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Consortia (INSACOG), the XBB.1.16 variant and highly transmissible sub-lineages formed from a combination of the Omicron sub-variants BA2.75 and BA2 are the most prevalent strains in central India. Union Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) Dr Bharati Prawin Pawar, recently informed Rajya Sabha, that Omicron and its sublineages still dominate the SARS-CoV-2 spread across the country. Advt ETHealthworld spoke exclusively with the top scientific minds in the country to understand the factors contributing to the ongoing rise in COVID-19 cases across the country, especially in states such as Maharashtra, Kerala, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and Karnataka. Experts opined on a series of issues focusing on the current scenario, including the much-talked-about XBB. 1.16 has the potential to invite another COVID wave, and whether influenza can act as a catalyst will give birth to uncertainty among the states already warned by the Center over the proliferation of positive cases.For the last few days, Max Hospital has started seeing some COVID positive cases. As per Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, Group Medical Director, Max Healthcare, and Senior Director, Institute of Internal Medicine, most of these patients are in outpatient clinics and have symptoms no different from the seasonal flu. Dr Budhiraja explained that the patients are essentially complaining of fever, headache, body aches, cough and cold, and some abdominal discomfort, and most of these symptoms are attributed to the seasonal flu.ETHealthworld spoke to Dr Raman Gangakhedkar, former Head Scientist of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Explaining the situation in clear terms, Dr Gangakhedkar said due to persistent fever and the resemblance of influenza symptoms with COVID-19, people are coming forward to get themselves tested, which earlier wasn’t the case due to hesitancy and self-testing. With this, the numbers are likely to increase because the governments earlier weren’t able to capture the endemic infection.Could XBB 1.16 invite another wave?Scientists believe that a fast-spreading XBB.1 descendant, XBB.1.16, could be behind the recent surge in COVID cases in India. Dr Rajib Dasgupta, Head, Centre for Social Medicine and Community Health, JNU, affirmed that, as is now reasonably well known, the COVID XBB 1.16 variant seems to be fueling the surge. Advt XBB 1.16 has so far not caused any mortality in India. XBB.1.5 had earlier been declared a variant of interest (VOI) by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Gujarat is the state that has seen the sharpest rise in COVID-19 infection cases. The Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC) sequenced the genomes of the most recent 50 confirmed COVID cases, and they found that 37, or 74 per cent, of these samples, belonged to the XBB.1 branch."Like COVID-19, influenza (H3N2 currently) also causes complications and potential mortality among the elderly and those with severe comorbidities and immunodeficient states. It is somewhat early to speculate on how fast XBB 1.16 will spread or whether it will cause excess complications and mortality. Most of the XBB-related mortality in the UK has been among the elderly so far, many in care home settings," Dr Dasgupta continued.Dr Gangakhedkar said there is no reason to believe that there is data that says XBB 1.16 is a variant of concern. People's health-seeking behavior plays a major role in the increment in reported numbers of a particular variant, and therefore, the concern should be focused more on surveillance. "We have to look at COVID-19, but we have also got to remember that this infection is now endemic. Unless we find a variant that is cause for concern, which is far away when it comes to comparison with the Omicron variants, we may not worry. Variants are anyway going to come because the virus keeps on mutating.""The situation demands that we be very careful and cautious," said Dr Budhiraja adding that the government, at its level, needs to ramp up the testing of people, including genomic surveillance that is important to identify the variant.COVID cases: Are we heading back to square one?Dr Ambarish Joshi, Sr Consultant, Pulmonary and Sleep Medicine, Primus Super Speciality Hospital, agreed that the rising COVID-19 cases regularly are a cause for concern. Usually, it starts like this and can have devastating consequences. The pulmonary expert added that we are on the edge, where ignorance can lead to another pandemic."After receiving the vaccination doses, people are not following basic safety norms to maintain hygiene and wear masks in crowds. Also, many of them have not taken the booster dose, which has made it more difficult to suppress the remaining effects of the virus. It is not over yet, and we should get back to maintaining social distance as well as safety measures," said Dr Joshi.H3N2 is in the news, and people who have symptoms are getting their tests done, and nowadays many of these panels have tests for these respiratory viruses and COVID, so they are getting detected as COVID-positive as well. Many people are relying on home antigen tests; Dr Budhiraja indicated that, in addition, most of these cases are mild and can be managed at home with just a simple symptomatic treatment.Highlighting that we do have some cases coming to the hospital with lower respiratory infections, and these come with mixed infections, more so with H3N2, and very few COVID admissions, Dr Budhiraja said, "These are generally people with multiple medical co-morbidities, elderly patients, diabetic patients, patients with heart disease, asthma, lung problems, or they come to the hospital for some other reason and get detected positive because they are running a fever, so these patients do need some specific treatment."Experts suggest that the changing season, rise in other respiratory illnesses, and low immunity could be possible reasons behind the current spike in infection cases. Adding to it, Dr Aditya S Chowti, Senior Consultant - Internal Medicine, Fortis Hospital, Cunningham Road, Bangalore, said, "The resemblance of symptoms between COVID-19 and seasonal influenza makes it arduous to distinguish one from the other without diagnostic testing. The swift transmission of both diseases can trigger a surge in hospitalisations, ultimately straining healthcare systems."Refusing to call the recent rise in cases a worrisome situation, Dr Gangakhedkar spoke about relying more on the value of statistical significance than an absolute number. He added that it is difficult to distinguish which kind of virus has affected the patient at this early stage. Doctors are testing patients for both H3N2 and COVID-19 viruses, and that could be a major factor behind the increase in coronavirus cases."Now that things have changed, it all depends on health-seeking or treatment-seeking behavior. So, the numbers are increasing, but there is no cause for panic. But we need to be vigilant. The surveillance has to pick up if any new mutant is spreading rapidly in clusters, and then only one has to start worrying about it," said Dr Gangakhedkar.Prevention is key to controlling the spike in flu and respiratory illnessesAccording to medical practitioners, respiratory illnesses are going to be present, but at the same time, these are easily preventable if all of us learn how to protect not only ourselves but also others if we become infected. Like COVID-19, the Influenza A subtype of H3N2 also can cause complications and potential mortality among the elderly and those with severe comorbidities or immune deficient states.Cautioning that one needs to be watchful for COVID-19 given a seasonal influenza outbreak, Dr Joshi said, "Seasonal influenza is a year-round disease burden. It causes respiratory issues, and the symptoms are very similar to COVID-19." He added by mentioning that COVID-19 at times can be tricky, and many times it can be asymptomatic as well. Therefore, getting in touch with a healthcare professional as soon as changes are felt in the body is essential.Flu occurs due to the seasonal cold wave and is an annually recurring period. However, doctors recommend that taking the right measures can save a lot of trouble. Experts we spoke to categorically highlighted the need for community awareness of the need to wear masks, follow hand hygiene, and take annual flu shots.However, experts point out that the number of influenza cases in India is currently increasing exponentially. The most recent information on IDSP-IHIP (Integrated Health Information Platform) indicates that a total of 397,814 cases of influenza-like illness (ILI) were reported for January 2023. In February 2023, the figure increased to 436,523 instances, and in the first nine days of March 2023, it was 133,412 cases.Does the solution lie in the booster shots?Many nations use the third and, reportedly, fourth booster doses as preventative doses against COVID-19. The penetration of booster dosage is very poor in India. As of March 1, 2023, around 22,85,81,945 booster doses of precaution had been given to the Indian population, making up roughly 10.35 per cent of all vaccines.Speaking about the vulnerable population that must go for booster doses, Dr Gangakhedkar said, "Booster doses are a must for people aged 60 and over, especially for those who have chronic morbidities. We at least know vaccines work very well. It protects you so much against hospitalization and death. So those who have not taken COVID-19 boosters should try to get the booster shot as soon as possible."Booster dosage is recommended by the WHO as well as the Indian government. Notably, the doctors we spoke to said that the Indian population is skeptical and apprehensive about taking booster doses.“There is no need to start taking additional doses of the COVID vaccine right now. Also, those who have not yet completed their three doses of the COVID vaccine should take it. It is important to remember that precautions will go a long way toward preventing this disease. And if at all you come down with symptoms, simply self-isolate, rest, hydrate yourself well, take paracetamol, get in touch with your doctor if your symptoms are not resolving, and most importantly, do not panic,” said Dr Budhiraja.To find mutations early, experts urged a stronger focus on genetic surveillance. Government must increase its testing of citizens and educate the public about the advantages of getting an annual flu shot. Apart from immunization, people must resume adhering to the standard safety precautions, such as masking up, maintaining hand cleanliness, isolating oneself if symptoms appear, maintaining social distance, and avoiding crowded areas for those at risk. By taking these safeguards and safety measures, we can prevent the spread of COVID-19 and seasonal influenza and safeguard our communities and ourselves.To prevent individuals from resorting to antibiotics, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) announced updated COVID-19 guidelines. The recommendation does not indicate the use of HCQ, Ivermectin, Molnupiravir, Favipiravir, Azithromycin, and Doxycycline.

H5N1 only sporadically infects humans – but it kills half of those who catch it. As the largest ever outbreak of the virus continues to rage, is New Zealand prepared? by Marc Daalder 20/03/202317/11/2023 Share this:ShareClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on X (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window) A severe outbreak of H5N1 among humans in Hong Kong in 1997, where the fatality rate was 52 percent, is sparking concern from some scientists.

He, as well as a handful of other researchers who took the makeshift vaccine after waiting a day to ensure Webster suffered no side effects, needed the immunisation ahead of venturing into ground zero of a novel pathogen outbreak.There are a lot of similarities between the origin stories of the Covid-19 pandemic and H5N1 influenza in humans. They both burst into public consciousness in east Asia, linked to sickness in live animal markets.There are a few differences as well, but the most important one is this: Covid-19 killed one in 28 known cases in Wuhan in early 2020, but H5N1 kills one in every two.READ MORE: * NZ wasn’t ready for a pandemic * Beating the next pandemic without a lockdownAs the world enters the third year of the worst ever outbreak of H5N1, Webster is among a series of experts raising the alarm that we need to be prepared for the worst case scenario – another pandemic. Speaking to Newsroom from his office in the Department of Virology at St Jude Children’s Hospital in Tennessee, he says our saving grace is that H5N1 is not yet well-adapted to humans. While it struggles to move from human to human, it has made the jump from wildlife into humans on dozens of occasions over the past two decades – the World Health Organisation has recorded 868 cases since 2003, of which 457 have died.The situation is getting worse, too. Last year, H5N1 was found spreading rapidly on a mink farm in Spain. That’s the first evidence of unhindered transmission between mammals outside of the lab.“The possibility is there,” Webster says, of the virus adapting to similarly spread between people.“I personally am quite concerned. This virus has tremendous capacity to acquire new genes, new mutations, and if it could spread easily between humans, it would be a catastrophe.”A panzooticPrior to Covid-19, there were frequent warnings about the potential for a pandemic. But most researchers weren’t looking at bat coronaviruses – they were worried about influenza.“Avian flu never went away, it just bubbled along – that’s not a technical term, but it just carried along. Obviously concern shifted to Covid-19, but we need to go back to influenza,” University of Otago epidemiologist Michael Baker says.That concern is partly why Webster dropped everything in November 1997 when he got a call from the head of the Influenza Branch at the United States Centres for Disease Control about six cases of severe influenza in Hong Kong. Three were in intensive care, one was already dead.“This is certainly the largest outbreak of H5N1, probably in most countries in the world,” Webster says.He called on a team of young scientists to join him in Hong Kong, where they quickly confirmed the virus was H5N1. The strain was known to Webster from the previous year, when outbreaks on Chinese poultry farms had killed between 70 and 100 percent of chickens. In May of 1997, the first human case was reported in a boy in Hong Kong, who died five days after admission to hospital. It took a while for researchers to determine that the virus that had killed the boy was H5N1, since there had never been a case of animal influenza infecting humans. Efforts to match virus samples from the boy against human samples held in Hong Kong and in Atlanta, where the CDC is based, were unsuccessful. Ultimately, scientists came to Webster in Tennessee, because he’d amassed a collection of antisera for all known influenza viruses.That was how the H5N1 connection was discovered. It put Webster on high enough alert that he purchased a next-day ticket to Hong Kong after receiving the call from the CDC in November 1997.After lengthy testing efforts, which included injecting influenza samples into fertile chicken eggs and a brief return to Memphis for genomic sequencing, Webster and his team matched up the new human influenza cases with H5N1 strains that were widespread at live bird markets in Hong Kong.The city culled its 1.3 million chickens from more than 100 live bird markets in two days. Then the markets were cleaned and disinfected and strict new biosecurity protocols were introduced when they reopened. H5N1 was kept out of the city for nearly two years, before an incursion in waterfowl markets prompted the government to mandate all ducks and geese be sold after processing and chilling.Food safety officials prepare to gas chicks during the 1997 poultry cull.

That’s because it is endemic in migratory birds, particularly ducks, which seem to be completely unaffected by most strains of the virus. They then transmit it to other migratory species and domesticated poultry – alongside occasional spillovers into mammals.Globally, the situation today is worse than ever before.“This is certainly the largest outbreak of H5N1, probably in most countries in the world,” Webster says.Other experts have called it a panzootic – a pandemic among animals. In the United States, 1.5 million chickens have died of the virus in the latest outbreak and nearly 60 million have been culled to fight it. The global toll of the disease and culling has topped 150 million birds, including 50 million in Europe and the UK and 10 million in Japan.And that’s just in domesticated animals.“The fact that there is a virus that can transmit mink-to-mink suggests that there is a possibility that it could transmit among us,” Webster says.“In the last two years there has been an unprecedented mortality of wild birds throughout the Northern Hemisphere due to the avian influenza virus,” Brett Gartrell, a professor of wildlife health at Massey University, says.“During this period, over 400,000 dead birds have been recorded from over 2600 separate mortality clusters in wild bird populations; however, the actual number of birds affected is estimated to be much higher. Deaths due to this strain of the virus have been reported from almost every country in Europe, in North and South America and Northern Africa.”It’s also increasingly spilling over into mammal populations.“It has transmitted to many, many mammals. You name it: Bears, sea mammals, tigers, foxes,” Webster says.In lab experiments, scientists have managed to make an H5N1 strain that spreads between ferrets, which are a good proxy for human-to-human transmission. The Spanish mink farm outbreak shows the virus can get there on its own too.“The fact that there is a virus that can transmit mink-to-mink suggests that there is a possibility that it could transmit among us,” Webster says.Animal incursionsThe worsening global situation raises important questions for New Zealand and how we would respond to two H5N1 scenarios – either its arrival in our birds or the development of a strain capable of transmitting between humans, which sparks a new pandemic.In the first situation, Biosecurity New Zealand within the Ministry for Primary Industries would be the lead on the response.Mary van Andel is Biosecurity NZ’s chief veterinary officer and she says we already have systems in place to detect H5N1 or any other severe avian influenza viruses.Every summer, biosecurity officials descend on hunting grounds near migratory bird sites across the country. There, they capture and take samples from more than 1000 ducks and test them for influenza. Throughout the year, birds admitted to wildlife hospitals are also tested if there’s a suspicion of influenza. And public reports are also taken in – all 20 avian mortality reports from last year tested negative for influenza.So far, neither H5N1 nor any other high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) has been detected in New Zealand.The good news is that van Andel thinks the chance of a wild introduction via a migratory bird is low.Dutch biosecurity officials gather the corpses of wild birds during a 2022 H5N1 outbreak. Photo: Rob Oo/Flickr“We are isolated from other land masses, do not have migratory waterfowl pathways and have strong border biosecurity,” she says.“A variety of migratory shorebirds and seabirds travel a long distance to return to New Zealand each spring, but due to the high mortality of HPAI viruses like H5N1, the risk for live infected species making the journey to arrive here is considered low. Together with DoC, Biosecurity New Zealand has sent AI screening kits to the Subantarctic Islands for testing to support reporting in case unusual mortality events are detected there.”So the birds that do come here are likely to die of the virus before they arrive and the birds that are resistant to the virus (ducks) don’t travel here from anywhere other than, rarely, Australia. There have only been two Northern Hemisphere duck species identified in New Zealand in the past 150 years, according to the Department of Conservation, and these likely came from Hawaii rather than North America, Asia or Europe.On the domesticated side of things, live poultry isn’t imported into New Zealand. The industry body works with biosecurity officials to monitor the health of farmed chickens. Any live exports are tested for HPAI.Baker is reassured by these steps and thinks a migratory introduction is unlikely.“It will fly into New Zealand, but it will fly inside an aircraft, it won’t be flapping its wings,” he says. The appropriate response if the virus were detected among domesticated birds here would be culling, he adds, which was successful when overseen by Webster in Hong Kong in the 1990s.“If the disease enters the country, it may move around the country in wild birds and traded poultry unless it is quickly eradicated. In a recent outbreak of a pathogenic avian influenza H7N7 strain in Australia, control and eradication were achieved by culling over 433,000 birds, including poultry, turkey, farmed emus, and pet birds,” Gartrell adds.“MPI would likely adopt a similar eradication strategy to prevent the virus from becoming established in New Zealand, however, it is not clear how this control strategy would be applied to wildlife populations. Early detection, reporting, containment and biosecurity measures will be important in trying to stamp out the disease to prevent further spread.”Van Andel says her response would depend heavily on the context, though movement restrictions, vaccination and culling were all on the table. The end goal would be to eliminate the virus.“If an HPAI virus was detected in New Zealand, the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) and our trading partners would be informed, and we would work with the relevant industry bodies and other government organisations on elimination,” she says.“The practices of culling wild birds and the destruction or modification of their habitat (e.g. wetlands, water bodies) have been deemed as ineffective measures for avian influenza control by global advisory organisations FAO (United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation) and WOAH.”An H5N1 pandemicAs worrying as an animal introduction might be, the scenario that keeps Baker and Webster up at night is pandemic H5N1.The Government’s influenza pandemic plan says we should be able to avoid relying on mass graves, but that some people may need to be buried unembalmed in body bags rather than caskets.In that case, the Ministry of Health and Health New Zealand/Te Whatu Ora would lead the response.Right now, surveillance is conducted as part of routine infectious disease testing. That includes hospital-based testing, the Southern Hemisphere Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Research Surveillance Project (SHIVERS), Flu-tracking and community virus surveillance.“Together, these surveillance systems provide a robust understanding of the burden of disease due to respiratory viruses. The systems are also designed to provide for early detection of non-seasonal influenza viruses such as Influenza H5N1,” a spokesperson for the health ministry says.It would take two working days after receiving a sample for ESR to confirm an H5N1 influenza result. This would spark a series of events, including a phone call to Andrew Old, head of the Public Health Agency, and the activation of the 2017 Influenza Pandemic Plan.Matt Hannant, the interim director of outbreak response in the National Public Health Service within Health NZ says the pandemic plan would be the basis of the response.“At Te Whatu Ora, we are well positioned to respond if an infectious disease enters into Aotearoa,” he says. “Te Whatu Ora has significant experience in managing diseases transmitted by the respiratory route through responding to Covid-19.”That pandemic plan makes for grim reading. It assumes a strain of similar lethality to the 1918 influenza pandemic. That’s around 2 percent of infections ending in death, significantly higher than Covid-19 but much, much lower than the current 52 percent fatality rate of H5N1.Modelling based on that 1918-esque scenario sees around two million people sickened over an eight-week period, peaking at 1.5 million active cases in weeks three to five. Just under 40,000 people would die, including 23,500 in the peak week. That’s 40 times greater mortality than an average week and 25 times greater than the record week for deaths in New Zealand (which came during the BA.5 Covid-19 wave in July last year).The plan says we should be able to avoid relying on mass graves, but that some people may need to be buried unembalmed in body bags rather than caskets.The sheer transmissibility of the virus means it will be hard to control, according to the plan, and the country would rapidly move from trying to keep influenza out to stamping it out to managing the impacts.A 2017 readiness exercise in Hong Kong involved a chicken cull at live bird markets. Photo: Getty ImagesBaker says this is the failed response trialled by most of the rest of the world to Covid-19 and that we should attempt to eliminate a potential pandemic H5N1 if we can.“Can we now abandon mitigation as our preferred option for flu pandemics? I think we can. I would say with avian influenza, as soon as you saw any evidence of human-to-human transmission, you would do anything to stamp it out,” he says.“The big argument is to stop these pandemics at source. Anyone who looked at the sequence of events with Covid-19 would think, well if instead of stopping it at the end of February, the Chinese had stopped it in mid-January or even in December the previous year, we’d be a lot better off.”Even if the pandemic virus isn’t halted at the source, New Zealand should still adopt an elimination approach, Baker believes.“The essentials of elimination are basically border management. A sub-category of elimination is exclusion. People often say elimination is reducing to zero, but it’s also maintaining zero from the beginning.”The end game isn’t particularly clear, other than waiting for vaccination to reduce the mortality burden. Flu vaccines are historically only about 50 percent effective on average and Baker thinks that pattern would hold for H5N1 as well.“I think we would see history repeating itself with influenza vaccines only giving 50 percent protection, moderate protection against severe disease and illness,” he says.Webster has a different view about the ideal response – he thinks elimination is unlikely given the virus is still endemic in animal reservoirs. Instead, mass vaccination should be the start of the pandemic response.In New Zealand, we have only a small store of 150,000 courses of a pre-pandemic H5N1 vaccine. The latest batch arrived in January and the Ministry of Health spokesperson says they are suited to a currently-circulating strain.The pandemic plan says these vaccines would be distributed to healthcare workers, other essential workers and the most vulnerable New Zealanders.“The pre-pandemic vaccine which we hold is expected to provide the best available vaccine-mediated protection against human disease from H5N1. We are not currently looking to acquire further vaccines,” the spokesperson says.They add that getting enough to immunise everyone in the country would take “several months” – an understatement, according to Webster.“If the virus starts transmitting human-to-human and starts killing like it did in Hong Kong, there will not be vaccines available because the world will simply gobble them up,” Webster says.“The first step, if this virus does transmit human-to-human, is to get the country totally vaccinated against influenza using the current vaccine. It’s not going to stop you from getting H5N1, but it may stop you from dying.” Marc Daalder Marc Daalder is a senior political reporter at Newsroom.
