Here we show that recombinant NAs across non-bat subtypes adopt various tetrameric conformations, including an “open” state that may help explain poorly understood variations in NA stability across viral strains and subtypes. We use homology-directed protein design to uncover the structural principles underlying these distinct tetrameric conformations and stabilize multiple recombinant NAs in the “closed” state, yielding two near-atomic resolution structures of NA by cryo-EM. In addition to enhancing thermal stability, conformational stabilization improves affinity to protective antibodies elicited by viral infection, including antibodies targeting a quaternary epitope and the broadly conserved catalytic site. Stabilized NAs can also be integrated into viruses without affecting fitness. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of NA structure, stability, and antigenicity, and establish design strategies for reinforcing the conformational integrity of recombinant NA proteins.

The two major viral glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), facilitate viral entry and egress from host cells, respectively. NA is an enzyme that binds and cleaves sialosides from glycans on the host cell surface to facilitate the release of nascent viral particles from infected cells, and is also proposed to assist other stages in the virus replication cycle1,2. Like HA, influenza A NAs are divided into subtypes that are clustered into the phylogenetically defined groups 1 (N1, N4, N5, and N8) and 2 (N2, N3, N6, N7, and N9), whereas influenza B NAs are clustered in a separate branch3. NA is a homotetrameric, type II integral membrane protein with a short cytoplasmic N-terminal domain. The C-terminal catalytic domain folds into a disulfide-stabilized and glycosylated six-bladed beta propeller and is supported by a hypervariable stalk domain4,5. Crystal structures of NA catalytic domains, either proteolytically released from virions or produced recombinantly, have consistently shown that four identical subunits interact non-covalently to form a globular “head” with four-fold symmetry2,6. The head features deep pockets on the exterior face of each protomer comprising the catalytic residues. NA contains several Ca2+ binding sites, one of which is highly conserved and supports the periphery of the catalytic pocket on each protomer, while another site at the four-fold symmetry axis is frequently, but not universally, observed across various subtypes7. Ca2+ ions have been shown to assist catalytic activity2 and have been resolved to varying degrees in crystal structures, with reports and predictions of increased structural flexibility in their absence8,9. These observations, combined with remote allosteric effects that impact sialoside binding and resistance to catalytic inhibitors, highlight the relatively plastic conformational landscape of NA10,11,12,13,14.While multiple studies have shown that antibodies against NA correlate with immunity against influenza viruses15,16,17,18,19,20, substantial gaps remain in our knowledge of NA-directed immunity, particularly in terms of the relationships between NA structure, conformational stability, and antigenicity. The antigenicity of NA has long been detailed using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from immunized and/or infected mice, which provided an initial understanding of its distinct antigenic regions—some of which span adjacent protomers—as well as mechanisms of both enzymatic inhibition and protection21,22,23,24,25. Although an NA-based vaccine, extracted from viral membranes and inactivated by formalin, improved humoral NA-directed enzymatic inhibition compared to commercial influenza vaccines in humans in a Phase I clinical trial more than 25 years ago26,27, only preclinical studies of NA-based vaccines have been reported since28,29,30,31,32. More recently, studies comparing antibodies elicited by infection or immunization with split virus vaccines have clearly demonstrated that infection results in substantially more robust NA-directed humoral responses in humans33. Protective human mAbs have therefore most frequently been isolated from infected rather than immunized individuals, with the recent exception of mAbs isolated from a minority of subjects that generated detectable anti-NA responses after receiving H7N9 vaccines33,34,35,36. These studies have further defined NA epitopes targeted by protective antibodies, most notably leading to the isolation of broadly cross-reactive and protective antibodies from an H3N2-infected individual that bind the catalytic site36.The disconnect between infection- and vaccine-elicited responses against NA highlights our incomplete knowledge of the structural and antigenic stability of NA outside its native context in the viral membrane. Conformational differences between membrane-bound and recombinant forms of several viral antigens have been noted previously, and the design of conformationally stabilized recombinant antigens has provided useful tools for basic and translational research37,38,39,40. In agreement with crystal structures, tomographic models of NA on the surface of virions have shown a compact, “closed” four-fold symmetric arrangement of the catalytic domains41,42. Yet in the absence of natural or exogenous tetramerization domains, soluble recombinant NA heads can dissociate into monomers43,44,45, suggesting that interactions between NA heads are relatively weak. Nevertheless, in contrast to other sialidases that share the same six-bladed propeller fold and can function as monomers46, it has frequently been reported that tetramer formation is a prerequisite for the function of influenza NA, and a correlation between enzymatic activity and immunogenicity of recombinant NAs has been observed43,45,47,48,49. Consequently, catalytic activity is often considered an indicator of the biologically relevant conformation50. However, enzymatic activity is neither a direct nor complete readout of the native antigenic structure of NA45. Recent attempts to better understand and improve the conformational stability of NA have shown some promise, and have suggested connections between Ca2+ binding, antigenicity, oligomerization, and both thermal and conformational stability44,45,51.Here we characterize in detail distinct tetrameric conformations adopted by recombinant soluble NAs, including an “open” tetrameric conformation that does not appear to represent the native membrane-bound conformation, and use this information to develop a general structure-based design strategy for stabilizing the closed tetrameric state. Closed versions of recombinant N1 NAs have improved stability and affinity to infection-elicited protective antibodies relative to their wild-type counterparts. Conformationally stabilized NAs may be valuable reagents for facilitating the design and discovery of NA-directed vaccines and therapeutics.ResultsTetrameric conformations of recombinant NA proteins vary across influenza strains and subtypesWe expressed and purified recombinant soluble NA proteins from every non-bat influenza A subtype and two influenza B viruses using a previously described construct design52 in which the NA head domain is genetically fused to the hVASP tetramerization domain53 (Fig. 1a, b). The proteins were secreted from mammalian cells and purified from clarified supernatants, yielding homogeneous size exclusion chromatography (SEC) profiles featuring a major peak corresponding to the estimated elution volume of a tetramer, with minimal aggregation (Supplementary Fig. 1a). We then analyzed the purified NAs by negative stain electron microscopy (NS-EM) with two-dimensional (2D) class averaging, a technique commonly used to evaluate the structural integrity of recombinant viral glycoproteins54,55,56,57,58. This analysis revealed substantial structural heterogeneity among the various recombinant NAs (Fig. 1c). Two tested NAs each from the N2 subtype and influenza B viruses, as well as representative NAs from N3 and N5, formed “closed” tetrameric structures in which the head domains packed tightly and resembled the four-fold symmetric structure classically observed by X-ray crystallography. In contrast, representative NAs from the N1 and N6 subtypes formed “open” tetramers in which the head domains did not form a single, compact structure. These NAs instead exhibited a clover-like appearance characterized by a thin stalk tethered to independent densities corresponding to the four globular head domains. This result is consistent with the observation that many NAs form monomers when produced recombinantly without a tetramerization domain44,45, and suggests that the strength of the tetrameric interface between head domains varies across NA strains and subtypes. Representative NAs from the N4, N7, N8, and N9 subtypes, in addition to a third tested N2 strain, formed mixtures of open and closed tetramers. We also produced and analyzed a previously reported N9 NA construct containing the stabilizing mutation Y170H (Y169aH in N2 numbering)44, which, despite showing an improved proportion of the closed state compared to its WT counterpart, still formed a significant population of open tetramers (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Finally, we characterized two N1 and one N2 recombinant NAs from the BEI Resources Repository at the NIH that were also genetically fused to hVASP. The N2 NA was found to adopt the closed conformation and further form rosettes through the hVASP domains, while both N1 NAs appeared open or disordered (Supplementary Fig. 1c). We found no clear correlation between SEC profiles (Supplementary Fig. 1a) or catalytic activity (Supplementary Fig. 1d) and the conformations observed by NS-EM for several recombinant NAs: samples showing predominantly open tetramers remained catalytically active.Fig. 1: Tetrameric conformations of recombinant NA proteins vary across influenza strains and subtypes.a NA structure and phylogeny.

The globular head domain of NA (residues 83–469, N1 numbering) was genetically fused to the hVASP tetramerization domain (TD) by a flexible GG linker and a thrombin protease cleavage site. All constructs contained an N-terminal hexahistidine tag, and some constructs additionally contained a Strep Tag.

While 2D classification of the data revealed slightly more compact structures than those obtained by NS-EM, the samples still showed substantial heterogeneity compared to the closed tetrameric structures seen in other subtypes (Fig. 1d). Several of the classes suggested that adjacent head domains formed dimers reminiscent of conformations observed in distantly related proteins with the same six-bladed propeller fold, such as the hemagglutinin (H), hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), and G proteins of paramyxoviruses59,60.We also determined the thermal stability of multiple NAs using nano differential scanning fluorimetry (nanoDSF) by monitoring intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence in buffers containing either 1 mM CaCl2 or 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). NAs from representative N3 and N5 (identified as closed by NS-EM) and N8 (mixed) strains were found to have the highest melting temperatures (Tm), all of which were above 60 °C regardless of buffer additives (Fig. 1f). N8-JD13-WT (A/Jiangxi Donghu/346/2013) had an additional clear yet incomplete transition between 46 and 52 °C depending on the buffer additive, suggesting a partial unfolding event or the unfolding of a minor population of less stable species. Another closed NA, N2-WI05-WT (A/Wisconsin/67/2005), was less stable but also relatively insensitive to Ca2+, with Tms of 55.1 °C in the presence of Ca2+ and 49.0 °C in 5 mM EDTA. In contrast, the open N1-CA09-WT and N1-MI15-WT (A/Michigan/45/2015), and particularly the mixed N4-DB16-WT (A/Redknot/Delaware Bay/310/2016), showed much greater sensitivity to Ca2+, with Tms below 50 °C in the presence of EDTA becoming 12.5–23 °C higher in the presence of Ca2+. Despite their relative phylogenetic similarity, N1-CA09-WT was found to be less thermally stable than N1-MI15-WT, particularly in the presence of Ca2+. These data indicate that the thermal stability of recombinant NAs can vary over a wide range, and suggest that Ca2+ contributes less to the stability of NAs that tend to form closed tetramers, possibly because head tetramerization has an independent stabilizing effect.We then evaluated the effects of added Ca2+ and the native stalk domain on the tetrameric conformations of soluble recombinant N1 NAs. Although NA contains an interprotomeric Ca2+ binding site that thermally stabilizes the protein (ref. 51 and above), the addition of 1 mM CaCl2 to purified N1-CA09-WT prior to NS-EM did not result in noticeable changes in tetramer closure (Supplementary Fig. 2c). To test whether exposure to Ca2+ throughout the entire purification process has an influence on tetramer closure, additional samples of N1-CA09-WT and N1-MI15-WT were purified in the constant presence of 1 mM CaCl2 (Fig. 1e). NS-EM of these samples again showed predominantly open tetrameric structures, although a minor population of closed tetrameric species was also observed. Inclusion of the native stalk domain in N1-CA09-WT using a previously described design that also includes hVASP61 did not result in closed tetramers in the absence of added Ca2+ (Supplementary Fig. 2d), although a partial improvement in the closure was again seen when Ca2+ was provided throughout the purification process. Interestingly, nanoDSF of samples treated with Ca2+ throughout the purification process (Supplementary Fig. 2e) showed blueshifted baselines relative to samples without Ca2+ throughout purification (Supplementary Fig. 2a), suggesting improved burial of tryptophan residues. This was particularly noticeable for N1-CA09-WT with the native stalk, which also showed poorly-defined melting transitions in the absence of added Ca2+ (compare Supplementary Fig. 2f to Supplementary Fig. 2a). Together, these data indicate that the open tetrameric state observed by NS-EM in various recombinant NAs, including those with and without the native stalk, cannot be attributed to Ca2+ deficiency alone.In summary, NS-EM analysis was required to recognize distinct tetrameric conformations adopted by different NA antigens, with recombinant N1 NAs in particular showing a tendency to form open tetramers. Treatment with Ca2+ was helpful for enhancing the thermal stability of recombinant soluble NAs, but it was not sufficient for fully restoring the closed quaternary conformation.Stabilization of the closed tetrameric state of N1 CA09 NAAlthough high-resolution structures for NA in its native context in the viral membrane are not yet available, cryoelectron tomographic reconstructions at modest resolution suggest that NA on the surface of H1N1 CA09 virions forms closed tetramers42. This observation is further supported by the protective mAb CD6, isolated from a mouse infected with H1N1 virus, which binds a quaternary epitope spanning two subunits of the NA tetramer62. Inspired by these indications that NA forms closed tetramers on the virion surface and the potential utility of recombinant NA antigens with improved stability, homogeneity, and native-like structure, we set out to stabilize N1 NA in the closed tetrameric state using structure-based design.The inter-protomer interface of N1-CA09-WT (PDB ID 4B7Q) has 3,172 Å2 of buried surface area between each protomer, but features many aqueous cavities and non-ideal polar contacts. We attempted to stabilize the inter-protomeric interface of N1-CA09 tetramers using homology-directed mutations inspired by NAs we identified as closed, as well as novel mutations identified purely by structural modeling (Fig. 2a). Based on our data indicating that recombinant N2, N3, and N5 NAs form predominantly closed tetramers, we analyzed amino acid differences at the interface between representative NAs from each of these subtypes and N1-CA09-WT. We also included N4 NA in this analysis even though it was characterized as only partially closed, as its conformational stability was better than N1-CA09-WT and the N4 subtype is phylogenetically closest to N1. To organize our design strategy, we identified residues involved in inter-protomer interactions by visual inspection and categorized them into four “spaces” (A, B, C, and D) that spanned the entire interface (Fig. 2b, see Supplementary Table 1 for lists of residues in each space). We developed a computational pipeline for homology-directed design using the Rosetta macromolecular modeling software63,64 in which potential interface-stabilizing mutations derived from closed NAs were symmetrically modeled both individually and in combination within each space. In parallel, design trajectories that allowed Rosetta to identify novel mutations without restriction to naturally observed substitutions were performed. Thirty-two designs were selected for experimental characterization, comprising designs with mutations restricted to each individual space as well as combined across multiple spaces.Fig. 2: Stabilization of the closed tetrameric state of N1 CA09 NA.a Design and analysis pipeline for stabilization of closed tetrameric NAs using homology-directed mutations and computational protein design.

Data are plotted as in panel d.Full size imageGenes for each stabilized NA protein (sNAp) were synthesized as genetic fusions to the hVASP tetramerization domain (Fig. 1b) and transfected into mammalian cells to assess expression. Nine designs that were detectable in cell culture supernatants by SDS-PAGE were purified by affinity chromatography and analyzed by NS-EM (see Supplementary Data 1 for amino acid sequences). Of these nine designs, only one (N1-CA09-sNAp-94) contained a substantial population of closed structures, with approximately half of the particles classified as closed based on the 2D class averages (Fig. 2c). To improve this design, one additional N2- and N3-inspired mutation was added that appended an individual methyl group to a valine in space A (V177I; N1-CA09-sNAp-114), which is distal to the C4 axis and near the CD6 binding site, resulting in predominantly closed particles by NS-EM with only a minor fraction of particles in the open state still detectable (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Data 2).Two additional rounds of design were performed to revert unproductive mutations from N1-CA09-sNAp-114 while maintaining closure and maximizing expression levels (see Supplementary Table 2 for summaries of mutations and expression levels). Space C, which includes residues immediately surrounding the C4 axis, featured mutations derived from N4 NA that could be reverted without deleterious effects to the closed conformation. Furthermore, the N5-inspired combination of C161V and S172A was added to remove an unpaired cysteine and slightly repack space D, adjacent to space C on the “underside” of NA, which greatly improved yield (N1-CA09-sNAp-130). N1-CA09-sNAp-155, which reverted an extra mutation at the surface-exposed position 453 of N1-CA09-sNAp-130, maintained closure with the similar yield to N1-CA09-WT and had its stabilizing mutations maximally buried to maintain proper antigenicity (Fig. 2c). Relative to N1-CA09-WT, N1-CA09-sNAp-155 features four mutations in space A, three in space B (on the underside of NA distal to the C4 axis), and three in space D. sNAp-130 and sNAp-155 were henceforth used interchangeably as representative sNAps for N1 CA09.While the V177I mutation suggested that improved packing in space A assists closure, the specific contributions of other mutations were less clear since they were introduced simultaneously in N1-CA09-sNAp-94. Reversion of the three space B mutations in N1-CA09-sNAp-130 did not decrease tetrameric closure (N1-CA09-sNAp-131), although it did reveal a role for these mutations in increasing sNAp yield (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Table 2). Strikingly, reversion of the single N5-derived space D mutation E165S from N1-CA09-sNAp-155 resulted in a roughly equal mixture of open and closed tetramers (N1-CA09-sNAp-134). Together, these data demonstrate that combining mutations in spaces A and D can drive the complete closure of CA09 NA.We found that the tetramer-stabilizing mutations in N1-CA09-sNAp-155 increased the Tm by 9.5 and 19.1 °C in the presence of CaCl2 and EDTA, respectively, when compared to N1-CA09-WT (Fig. 2d). Sensitivity to Ca2+ was substantially decreased, with only a 2.9 °C difference between Ca2+- and EDTA-containing conditions. This finding is consistent with our earlier observation that the thermal stability of closed tetramers tended to be less dependent on Ca2+ (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). Monitoring static light scattering (SLS) also revealed an increase in aggregation temperature for N1-CA09-sNAp-155 of 9.7 °C in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 2e). Interestingly, neither protein aggregated in the presence of EDTA. To assess conformational stability over time, N1-CA09-sNAp-155 was analyzed by NS-EM after storage for 6, 10, and 15 days at 4 °C and showed retention of the closed state during this period (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) was used to collect data on a small set of deuterium-exposed peptides from both N1-CA09-WT and N1-CA09-sNAp-130, which indicated multiple regions of differential stability (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Several peptides were identified near the inter-protomer interface and the catalytic pocket that showed decreased deuterium uptake for the sNAp, including one peptide that includes the main catalytic residue (Y402) and another peptide containing the substrate-binding residue R368. One peptide (residues 215–224) was more dynamic in the sNAp, which includes a solvent-exposed loop and part of a beta-strand that is adjacent to two stabilizing mutations (S196T and V205I). Overall, most of the changes observed by HDX-MS showed a reduction in solvent accessibility or an increase in local ordering consistent with the sNAp adopting a more “closed” conformation compared to N1-CA09-WT. Both N1-CA09-sNAp-130 and N1-CA09-sNAp-155 retained catalytic activity, although they were less active than N1-CA09-WT (Supplementary Fig. 3c). Finally, the stabilizing mutations in N1-CA09-sNAp-130 also resulted in predominantly closed tetramers when transferred to recombinant constructs containing the complete stalk domain (Supplementary Fig. 3d). Compared to the equivalent design lacking stabilizing mutations (Supplementary Fig. 2f), nanoDSF showed significantly higher Tms and more defined melting transitions, with 13.5 °C and 18.3 °C increases in Tm in the presence of Ca2+ and EDTA, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 3e).In all, our stabilization of N1 CA09 showed that a combination of structure- and homology-based design can both conformationally stabilize the closed tetrameric state and improve thermal stability and local ordering. The designed stabilizing mutations were functional with or without the inclusion of the native NA stalk, and mutations in both spaces A and D seemed most important for conformational stability.Structural and bioinformatic analysis of closed state stabilizing mutationsTo better understand the roles of our stabilizing mutations, we determined a cryo-EM structure of N1-CA09-sNAp-155 at 3.2 Å resolution (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 4a–g, and Supplementary Table 3). 2D class averages obtained from samples that were purified and vitrified in the absence of supplemental Ca2+ exclusively showed closed NA tetramers resembling those observed in crystal structures, in contrast to our earlier cryo-EM 2D class averages of N1-CA09-WT (Fig. 1d). The 3D reconstruction of N1-CA09-sNAp-155 confirmed its adoption of the closed tetramer in solution (Fig. 3a). The structure is highly similar to N1 CA09 crystal structures (1.18 and 1.83 Å backbone root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) to PDB 4B7Q over one and all four chains of the tetramer, respectively). The main differences were in a few solvent-exposed loops that were poorly ordered in N1-CA09-sNAp-155, including the C-terminal region from residues 458–469 (Supplementary Fig. 4h), the ‘150-loop’ consisting of residues 145–150, and the ‘430-loop’ consisting of residues 429–437 (Supplementary Fig. 4i). The apparent flexibility of the 150- and 430-loops is consistent with previous structural observations and computational modeling of these regions65,66,67. Additionally, a backbone segment adjacent to the space A mutations was slightly rearranged such that W455 packed closely against the introduced mutations and W457 moved away from its native position at the interface (Fig. 3b). Despite this rearrangement, none of the mutated positions in spaces A, B, and D showed substantial changes in their main chain coordinates and, other than their interactions with W455 and W457, the intended interactions were formed. For example, P99 and T196 (T195 in N2 numbering) in space A form a central hydrophobic contact across the interface that closely matches the same interaction seen in the NA structures used for homology-directed design (Figs. 3b and 4a). Likewise, I177 (I176 in N2 numbering) provides additional hydrophobic packing in both N1-CA09-sNAp-155 and the NAs of other subtypes relative to N1 CA09, while I205 adds further hydrophobic packing that was favored by Rosetta. In space B, the Rosetta-derived Q408M and the homology-inspired Y100L and R419V simultaneously provide improved hydrophobic packing and decrease the number of partially buried polar groups at the interface.Fig. 3: Cryo-EM structure of N1-CA09-sNAp-155.a Cryo-EM 2D class averages for N1-CA09-sNAp-155 showing fully closed tetramers (scale bar, 10 nm) (top left).

The red sphere highlights the position of a cavity in space D. f Mutation schematics and NS-EM comparing N8-JD13-WT, N8-JD13-sNAp-282, and N8-JD13-sNAp-285 (scale bar, 10 nm). NS-EM was performed and analyzed multiple times and representative images are shown.Full size imageIn contrast to intuitive stabilization mechanisms such as the cavity-filling mutations employed in space A, the N5-inspired space D mutation E165S does not have an obvious structural explanation. Crystal structures of N2, N3, N4, and N5 NAs all show less bulky residues at position 165, including S, T, and V (Fig. 4a). Interestingly, in all known NA structures a substantial cavity exists adjacent to the 160-loop and near the inter-protomeric interface (Fig. 4a), raising the possibility that the E165S mutation may function by helping preorganize this region during tetramer assembly. Several N2 NA structures showed partial filling of this cavity through a T131Q mutation (e.g., PDB 6BR5; Fig. 4a), which could also partially explain the improved conformational stability of NAs from this subtype.To better understand NA sequence-structure relationships, a comprehensive dataset of unique NA sequences from all available influenza A viruses isolated before December 31, 2019, was compiled, and the mutational frequencies of key positions in spaces A and D were evaluated within each subtype. As expected, some variation was observed in the amount of sequence diversity at each position, ranging from universal conservation of the tyrosine nucleophile in the catalytic site (Y402 and Y406 in N1 and N2 numbering, respectively) to high diversity at several surface-exposed positions (e.g., position 386 in N1 NAs) (Fig. 4c). However, sequence diversity within each subtype was generally low: positions of mean entropy in N1 and N2 NAs, for which far greater numbers of unique sequences were available compared to the animal-derived N3, N4, and N5 subtypes, showed ~97% conservation of the predominant amino acid.Fewer than 0.05% of the 4,422 animal and 13,735 human N1 NA sequences included in our dataset contained any of the five stabilizing mutations at positions 99, 165, 177, 196, and 205 (Fig. 4d). The vast majority of sequences instead possessed the less stable identities observed in N1-CA09-WT. Position 99 was the most variable, with valine present in ~9.8% of the sequences. We predict that both isoleucine and valine at position 99 favor the open state, and 99.9% of N1 NA sequences contain one of these two residues. NAs from N2 (dataset of 8,888 animal and 23,121 human sequences), N3 (942 animal sequences), and N4 (242 animal sequences) are also highly conserved at most of these positions and share multiple features that are distinct from N1 NAs, despite the close phylogenetic relationship between N1 and N4 (Fig. 1a). For example, P99 and T196 (195 in N2 numbering) are nearly completely conserved in all three subtypes. These residues form a consistent hydrophobic contact and play key roles in the sNAp designs. In contrast, position 177 (176 in N2 numbering) in space A is more variable in N2 and N3 NAs, with multiple identities appearing frequently, while N4 has a universally conserved valine at this position. N2-IN11-WT (A/Indiana/10/2011), which we found to be predominantly closed (Fig. 1c), contains a methionine at position 176, showing that this substitution can also favor the closed state similarly to isoleucine. N5 NAs have converged on a different solution in space A, maintaining complete conservation of the distinctive Y203, which both fills the cavity and accepts a hydrogen bond from the backbone amide of residue 99, thereby achieving the same outcome as P99 and T196 (Fig. 4a, d). In space D, further similarities are observed among the more stable subtypes (N2, N3, N4, and N5) at position 165, with less flexible smaller or beta-branched amino acids (A/S/T/V/I) found in >99.9% of all sequences in these subtypes, with valine, serine, and threonine most prevalent by far.These structural and bioinformatic analyses provide sequence-based signatures that appear to explain the conformational differences we observed in recombinant NAs by NS- and cryo-EM. Specifically, the combination of a small side chain at position 165 and a well-packed space A correlates with the stability of the closed tetrameric conformation.Design of stabilized closed tetrameric N8 NAAlthough our finding that recombinant N8-JD13-WT forms a mixture of open and closed tetramers (Fig. 1c) is consistent with a previous report showing that N8 NAs can form monomers and dimers, a number of infection-elicited N8 NA-specific antibodies recognized a quaternary epitope23, providing an incentive for tetramer stabilization. We applied the lessons learned from stabilizing N1 CA09 to generate closed N8 NA tetramers. Analysis of existing N8 NA crystal structures showed hydrophobic packing in space A similar to that of N4 NAs, featuring P99 and T196. However, space D contained the large, polar Q165 and a notable difference from other subtypes with a glutamic acid at position 162 instead of a proline (Fig. 4e). This combination of a well-packed space A and a more “open-like” space D appeared to explain its heterogeneous conformational phenotype. Although Q165S alone (N8-JD13-sNAp-282) was insufficient, the combination of E162P and Q165S (N8-JD13-sNAp-285) provided complete stabilization of the closed state of N8 as assessed by NS-EM, further emphasizing the cooperative effects of spaces A and D on stabilization (Fig. 4f). While N8-JD13-sNAp-285 showed only small improvements in its primary Tm in the presence of either Ca2+ or EDTA relative to N8-JD13-WT, the stabilizing mutations minimized an earlier partial unfolding transition at 45–55 °C, consistent with its more homogeneous adoption of the closed state (Supplementary Fig. 5a). A similar effect on Tagg was observed (Supplementary Fig. 5b). However, conformational evaluation over time by NS-EM showed that, in contrast to N1-CA09-sNAp-155, tetramer closure of N8-JD13-sNAp-285 decreased over the course of a week at 4 °C, indicating that further conformational stabilization should be possible (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Finally, N8-JD13-sNAp-285 was still catalytically active, although less so than N8-JD-WT (Supplementary Fig. 5d).Mutation of stabilizing residues in N2 NA prevents closed tetramer formationGiven the clear stabilizing effects of key positions in spaces A and D, we hypothesized that mutating them to amino acids observed in more open subtypes would destabilize the closed N2-WI05-WT tetramer. Mutations were made separately in each space to make space A more strongly resemble WT N1 NAs and space D resemble N1 or N8 NAs, while avoiding steric clashes (Supplementary Fig. 5e). The V165E mutation in space D alone was sufficient to induce global structural changes including dissociation of the heads, but also led to the formation of soluble aggregates. V165Q resulted in a more subtle effect, causing about half of the tetrameric particles to adopt the open state while the rest remained closed. In space A, an I177V/T196S (N1 numbering, see Supplementary Table 1 for conversions to N2 numbering) double mutant remained closed, but the addition of P99I led to the formation of unassembled monomers and aggregates. We next combined V165Q with I177V and T196S and found that the protein formed either open tetramers or lower-order oligomers (Supplementary Fig. 5e). Thermal denaturation of this triple mutant destabilized NA protein (desNAp), N2-WI05-desNAp-255, showed a decreased Tm, a strongly redshifted baseline in its intrinsic fluorescence emission spectrum, and no apparent stabilization by Ca2+ (Supplementary Fig. 5f). Enzymatic activity was also abolished in N2-WI05-desNAp-255 (Supplementary Fig. 5g). Together, these data indicate that the same design rules that enabled stabilization of the closed tetrameric state of N1 CA09 and N8 JD13 could be applied in reverse to destabilize the closed state of N2 WI05.Design of additional closed recombinant N1 NA tetramersTo assess the portability of the closed state-stabilizing mutations, mutations from N1-CA09-sNAp-155 were introduced into the NA of N1 MI15, from the same post-2009 human lineage as CA09. We found that the sNAp-155 mutations clearly assisted stabilization of the closed state but were insufficient for complete closure, as N1-MI15-sNAp-155 adopted a mixture of the open and closed states (Fig. 5a).Fig. 5: Design and Structural Characterization of N1-MI15-sNAp-174.a Application of sNAp-155 mutations to N1 MI15 and addition of the space D stabilizing mutation T131Q resulted in fully closed N1-MI15-sNAp-174 tetramers (scale bar, 10 nm). NS-EM was performed and analyzed multiple times and representative images are shown. b Thermal denaturation of N1-MI15-WT and N1-MI15-sNAp-174 in the presence of 1 mM CaCl2 (closed circles and solid lines) or 5 mM EDTA (open circles and dashed lines), monitored by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence.

All residues shown as sticks in the WT model are conserved between N1-CA09-WT and N1-MI15-WT.Full size imageGiven our hypothesis that E165S favors closure by making space D more ordered, we focused on redesigning the aqueous cavity surrounding D103, which is directly adjacent to residue 165 and another potential source of structural instability, in order to stabilize N1 MI15. This cavity is adjacent to, but not immediately at, the interprotomer interface. After generating a homology model of N1-MI15 using PDB ID 4B7Q as a template, we applied our structure- and homology-guided design strategy to this space. Among 20 designs building on N1-MI15-sNAp-155, four were found to predominantly favor the closed state, with three showing exclusively closed particles in NS-EM 2D class averages (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 6a). These designs utilized an N2-inspired V166P mutation along with complementary cavity filling from V114I (N1-MI15-sNAp-165 and -176), an N2-inspired T131Q mutation that provides both improved packing and hydrogen bonding in the cavity (N1-MI15-sNAp-174 and -176), and homology-directed hydrophobic filling of the cavity (N1-MI15-sNAp-183). Due to the higher yield of N1-MI15-sNAp-174 compared to the other designs and the simplicity of the single additional stabilizing mutation (T131Q; Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 2), this design was selected for further analyses. Mirroring the results obtained with other sNAps, the stability of N1-MI15-sNAp-174 was relatively insensitive to Ca2+ and the Tm of the sNAp was 14.7 °C higher than N1-MI15-WT in the presence of EDTA (Fig. 5b). The Tagg was also higher in the presence of either Ca2+ or EDTA (Fig. 5c), and N1-MI15-sNAp-174 maintained the closed tetrameric state over a period of 15 days (Supplementary Fig. 6b). It remained catalytically active, although at reduced levels compared to its open WT counterpart (Supplementary Fig. 6c). The success of these designs established multiple sets of mutations that stabilize closed N1 NA tetramers—including several that do not make direct contact across the interface—and highlight the cavity in space D as a key determinant of closed tetramer stability.We determined the structure of the N1-MI15-sNAp-174 tetramer at 3.2 Å resolution using cryo-EM (Fig. 5d, Supplementary Fig. 7a–g, and Supplementary Table 3). The structure, which strongly resembled the overall structure of N1-CA09-sNAp-155 (backbone RMSD of 0.77 and 0.80 Å over one and all four subunits of the tetramer, respectively), confirmed that N1-MI15-sNAp-174 adopts the closed tetrameric state in solution. The backbone rearrangement in space A observed in the N1-CA09-sNAp-155 structure was also found in N1-MI15-sNAp-174, along with a similar lack of density for the C-terminal regions, the 150-loop, and the 430-loop (Supplementary Fig. 7h, i). The new T131Q mutation helps fill the space D cavity as intended while forming a hydrogen bond to the side chain of S442 (Fig. 5e).We next applied the sNAp-155 mutations to more distantly related N1 NAs from the avian H5N1 strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (VN04) and a pre-pandemic lineage of human H1N1, A/WSN/1933 (WSN33). The resultant N1-VN04-sNAp-155 and N1-WSN33-sNAp-155 formed predominantly open tetramers (Supplementary Fig. 6d, e). We reasoned that making the sequences of these sNAps more like N1-CA09-sNAp-155 and N1-MI15-sNAp-174 overall should stabilize them in the closed tetrameric state. We therefore made substitutions at other buried positions in N1 VN04 and N1 WSN33 that differed from N1 CA09 and N1 MI15, an approach similar to the Repair-and-Stabilize strategy recently developed for stabilization of HIV-1 Env trimers68, and combined these with mutations used to stabilize N1 CA09 and N1 MI15. N1-VN04-sNAp-354, which combined the T131Q substitution in space D that stabilized N1-MI15-sNAps with mutation of three nearby residues to the amino acids in N1 CA09 and N1 MI15 (I106V, V163I, and A166V), formed exclusively closed tetramers as determined by NS-EM (Supplementary Fig. 6d).The sequence of N1 WSN33 NA differs from N1 CA09 and N1 MI15 at many positions in both the space D cavity and the rest of the tetrameric interface. In addition to the sNAp-155 mutation set, the substitution of six residues across spaces A, B, and D to the identities of N1 CA09 and N1 MI15 (G105S, I106V, A157T, V163I, A166V, and R210G; N1-WSN33-sNAp-366) substantially improved tetramer closure (Supplementary Fig. 6e), demonstrating that there are inherent differences in interface stability between N1 WSN33 and N1 CA09/N1 MI15 that can be altered by focusing purely on the interface and the space D cavity. The addition of T131Q to this set of mutations resulted in a sNAp (N1-WSN33-sNAp-367) that further improved tetramer closure, while hydrophobic packing mutations in the cavity (N1-WSN33-sNAp-375) were less effective. To determine if sequence differences distant to the interface contribute to closed tetramer formation, we changed eight buried residues distributed throughout the globular head of N1-WSN-sNAp-375 which differed from N1 CA09 to the amino acids in N1 CA09, resulting in the predominantly closed N1-WSN-sNAp-378 (Supplementary Fig. 6e). These data suggest that while spaces A and D are key for closure, packing interactions distant from the interface can remotely influence interface-stabilizing mutations. Transfer of general packing residues from one strain to another thus offers an additional strategy for stabilization while maintaining native surface antigenicity. Together, the strategies we provide should be widely applicable across many N1 NAs as well as NAs from other subtypes.Effects of N1 NA Tetramer Stabilization on Viral Fitness and AntigenicityWe next tested whether mutations that stabilize the closed tetrameric state impact viral fitness by generating CA09 H1N1 reporter influenza viruses69 with and without the N1-CA09-sNAp-155 mutations in the NA gene by reverse genetics, and observed similar growth kinetics over 42 hours postinfection (Fig. 6a). Sequencing revealed that the virus carrying N1-CA09-sNAp-155 acquired a T466A mutation in the stabilized NA, and both viruses acquired mutations in HA (Supplementary Table 4). We found that recombinant soluble N1-CA09-sNAp-155 with the T466A mutation adopted the closed tetrameric state, confirming that this mutation does not affect the tetramer closure (Fig. 6b). These results demonstrate that tetramer-stabilizing mutations are compatible with virus growth, which is consistent with the closed tetramer being the biologically relevant form of the protein on the viral surface.Fig. 6: Effects of N1 NA tetramer stabilization on viral fitness and antigenicity.a Growth curve of A/California 07/2009 H1N1 influenza reporter viruses with WT NA and NA with sNAP-155 mutations on MDCK-SIAT1-PB1 cells.

The experiment was repeated twice, and representative results are shown. b NS-EM of a recombinant soluble N1-CA09-sNAp-155 with the T466A mutation acquired during growth of the R3ΔPB1 A/California 07/2009 H1N1 sNAp-155 virus (scale bar, 10 nm). NS-EM preparation was performed once. c Models of Fabs of murine CD6 (purple) and human 1G01 (green) bound to CA09 NA. CD6 binds a quaternary epitope that spans two protomers, while 1G01 binds within and around the catalytic pocket. Models were generated by aligning crystal structures of CD6 (PDB ID 4QNP) and 1G01 (PDB ID 6Q23) Fabs to a single tetramer of CA09 NA (PDB ID 4B7Q). d Binding kinetics of anti-NA mAbs to N1-CA09-WT, N1-CA09-sNAp-130, N1-MI15-WT, and N1-MI15-sNAp-174. Biolayer interferometry sensorgrams of 1G01 IgG (left) and CD6 IgG (right) binding to N1-CA09-WT (red, top row), N1-CA09-sNAp-130 (blue, top row), N1-MI15-WT (red, bottom row), and N1-MI15-sNAp-174 (blue, bottom row). Upper and lower sensorgrams within each row were measured in buffers containing 1 mM CaCl2 and 5 mM EDTA, respectively. Experimental data (colored traces) were fitted (black lines) with the binding equations describing a 2:1 interaction.Full size imageTo further understand the relevance of the closed and open states, we compared the antigenicity of WT NA proteins and sNAps. The murine mAb CD6, isolated from a mouse infected with a sublethal dose of A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) virus, recognizes a quaternary epitope that spans two neighboring NA protomers62. CD6 is highly protective and potently inhibits viral replication in vitro. The second mAb, 1G01, isolated from a human immediately after H3N2 virus infection, is the broadest anti-NA antibody described to date, providing protection against many influenza A and B viruses by targeting the highly conserved catalytic site36 (Fig. 6c). We first used flow cytometry to assess the binding of fluorescently labeled CD6 and 1G01 to HEK293F cells transfected with plasmids encoding full-length N1-CA09-WT and N1-CA09-sNAp-130 constructs with native N-terminal cytosolic domains, transmembrane domains, and stalks that bore C-terminal myc tags to enable assessment of surface expression levels. Both CD6 and 1G01 unambiguously bound to both the WT and stabilized membrane-anchored NAs in the presence or absence of 5 mM EDTA (Supplementary Fig. 8). The similar binding of CD6—which targets a quaternary epitope—to both NAs is again consistent with the closed tetramer being the biologically relevant form that is present on viral membranes.We next measured antibody binding affinities to the soluble versions of N1-CA09-WT and N1-CA09-sNAp-130 by biolayer interferometry. While both proteins were recognized by 1G01 IgG with similar affinity in the presence of CaCl2, the antibody bound to N1-CA09-WT with much lower affinity than to N1-CA09-sNAp-130 in the presence of EDTA (Fig. 6d). Strikingly, the quaternary epitope-specific CD6 IgG minimally bound N1-CA09-WT regardless of the presence of Ca2+, indicating that the CD6 epitope was not properly formed in the open N1-CA09-WT. By contrast, the same antibody readily and avidly bound to N1-CA09-sNAp-130 in the presence or absence of Ca2+. The binding data for the N1 CA09 NAs are consistent with our NS-EM data, which showed that Ca2+ alone was insufficient for stabilizing the closed states of these antigens. WT and stabilized soluble versions of N1 MI15 were also analyzed. Although 1G01 and CD6 binding to the WT and stabilized versions of N1-MI15 was not substantially different in the presence of Ca2+, we again observed strong binding of both mAbs to only N1-MI15-sNAp-174 in the presence of EDTA (Fig. 6d). In comparison with our earlier NS-EM analysis, the data for the N1-MI15 antigens indicate that N1-MI15-WT can adopt the closed tetrameric state—or perhaps dimers of adjacent protomers—in the presence of both Ca2+ and CD6, but not either of the two alone, while the stabilized N1-MI15-sNAp-174 homogeneously adopts the closed tetrameric state regardless of Ca2+.Together, these data suggest that the head dissociation observed in recombinant soluble NAs is far less frequently sampled in membrane-anchored NAs. Stabilization of the closed tetrameric state of NA through structure-based design therefore enables the generation of recombinant antigens that more accurately reflect the biologically relevant conformation of the protein.DiscussionInfluenza NA has been an attractive yet temperamental target for universal influenza countermeasures. We have shown that recombinant soluble NA tetramers from several different influenza strains and subtypes adopt an open tetrameric conformation despite the presence of an exogenous tetramerization domain and excess Ca2+, while others form the crystallographically observed closed tetramer. These data may help explain reports of different stabilities among NAs from various subtypes50 and are consistent with observations that NA protomers have a tendency to dissociate23,44. However, to our knowledge, no previously published work has characterized the open tetrameric conformation adopted by many recombinant soluble NAs. The open conformation we observed is similar to those found in distantly related tetrameric viral glycoproteins, leaving open the possibility that this conformation has biological relevance59,60. Nevertheless, several lines of evidence suggest that NA forms closed tetramers on the surface of influenza virions, and our work provides additional evidence in support of this view while also highlighting the importance of the closed state for stability and binding to protective infection-elicited antibodies. Such differences between the native transmembrane and recombinant soluble forms of glycoproteins are not uncommon. For example, many class I fusion proteins require stabilizing mutations to maintain their native—and often metastable—prefusion conformations when produced recombinantly70.Inspired by knowledge of the sequences and structural phenotypes of homologous NAs, we stabilized the closed tetrameric state using a homology-directed design strategy similar to the recently reported Repair-and-Stabilize approach applied to HIV-1 envelope trimers68,71. We identified several structural features that work together to stabilize the closed NA tetramer: direct interactions between subunits at the tetrameric interface, preorganization of the tetrameric interface within each subunit by intra-protomeric interactions near the interface, and general stabilization of the structure of each subunit by packing interactions distal to the interface. Two regions, which we refer to as spaces A and D, appear to have a particularly strong influence on NA stability and conformation. Multiple naturally occurring stabilizing and destabilizing mutations in space D have been described previously10,51, and comparisons to homologous NAs led to a single stabilizing mutation in space C in an N9 NA which facilitated structure determination of NA–antibody complexes44. Whereas mutations in space A and the space D cavity stabilize the closed tetrameric state by improving atomic packing in these interfaces or interface-proximal regions, the mechanism of other mutations is less clear. For example, there is no obvious structural rationale for the stabilizing effect of the E/Q165S mutation, yet this position—which stood out when sequence alignments of several NA subtypes were compared—is a critical determinant of tetramer closure. The success of homology-based mutations reflects the sensitivity and complexity of the determinants of NA stability and provides a roadmap towards the design of additional stabilizing mutations to NAs from diverse influenza strains and subtypes.Our findings have several implications for previous and future studies of influenza NA. We found that several commonly used assays—SEC, enzymatic activity, and thermal stability—were generally unable to distinguish between the open and closed forms of the enzyme due to inherent differences between NAs from different strains. Like several previous studies of other viral glycoprotein antigens39,40,54,55,56,57,58,72,73,74, structural characterization by EM was required to establish the conformational state of most samples. Although antigenic characterization using protective mAbs that bind a quaternary epitope or the catalytic site also clearly distinguished the open and closed forms, only a few such mAbs are currently available, limiting the diversity of NAs that can be characterized in this way. We anticipate that with the identification of additional NA-specific mAbs with the desired properties, antigenic characterization could become a rapid, widely accessible, and powerful tool for assessing NA tetrameric conformation.Furthermore, our data suggest that the recombinant soluble NA proteins used in many previous studies, while possibly presumed to be in the crystallographically observed closed tetrameric state based on biochemical assays, may have been partially or wholly in the open conformation. This disconnect could lead to erroneous interpretations of experimental outcomes, most particularly for serological measurements, and could limit the discovery of valuable mAbs. If so, our understanding of NA antigenicity and immunogenicity may be incomplete or compromised, particularly for NAs from the highly relevant but less stable N1 subtype. While Ca2+ treatment has been frequently used for NA stabilization45,51,75,76, our work emphasizes that Ca2+ alone is likely insufficient for completely repairing the loss of conformational integrity in many recombinant soluble NAs. Stabilizing mutations provide an alternative approach to improving conformational integrity, resulting here in several recombinant soluble NAs that homogeneously adopt the closed tetrameric conformation that, to the best of our knowledge, is present on influenza virions. These improvements are maintained even in the presence of EDTA, which could prove particularly useful for proper maintenance of conformational epitopes when sNAps are exposed to assay or biological conditions that lack adequate Ca2+ concentrations.Our work provides a design-based strategy for overcoming the inherent conformational instabilities of recombinant soluble NA proteins to improve their conformational and antigenic profiles. As highlighted by the transformational effects of the development of prefusion-stabilized class I viral fusion proteins39,70,77,78, the availability of stable, native-like recombinant soluble glycoproteins can broadly catalyze research and development efforts, including serological assays, monoclonal antibody isolation, structure determination of antigen-antibody complexes, immunogen design, and vaccine manufacturing.MethodsCell linesExpi293F cells, a female human embryonic kidney cell line adapted to grow in suspension, were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Catalog A14527). Expi293F cells were cultured in Expi293 Expression Medium (Life Technologies) at 37 °C, 8% CO2, and shaking at 150 RPM. 293T-PB1 cells used for virus rescue were kindly donated from Jesse Bloom (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center). MDCK-SIAT1-PB1 cells used for virus propagation were described previously69. The parental MDCK-SIAT1 cells were purchased from Millipore Sigma (Catalog 05071502). Cell lines were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, and for MDCK-SIAT1-PB1 cells, geneticin (1 mg ml−1) and puromycin (0.25 µg ml−1) was further added.Protein expression and purificationSequences for all NA proteins are provided in Supplementary Data 1. The cytoplasmic, transmembrane, and stalk domains of the wild-type (WT) NA (residues 1–82, N1 numbering) were replaced by affinity purification tags, a tetramerization domain derived from human vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (hVASP)53, a thrombin protease cleavage site, and a two-residue GG linker. NA constructs were expressed by transient transfection in Expi293F cells (ThermoFisher Scientific) at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/ml using the ExpiFectamineTM 293 Transfection Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific), or alternatively at a density of 3.0 × 106 cells/ml using PEI-MAX (Polyscience). Prior to protein purification, the supernatants were harvested 5 days post-transfection and centrifuged at 3,700 x g to remove cell debris. Proteins were purified from clarified supernatants by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) using either Ni2+- or Co2+-containing resin. For Ni2+-based IMAC, clarified supernatants were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with Ni2+ Sepharose High-Performance histidine-tagged protein purification resin (Cytiva) and bound protein eluted using 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 300 mM imidazole. For Co2+-based resin, clarified supernatants were flowed over Talon resin (Takara), and bound protein eluted in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole. Eluted proteins were further purified by SEC into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or 25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol using a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 column (Cytiva). For proteins that were purified in the constant presence of CaCl2, 1 mM CaCl2 was added to the wash and elution buffer. Eluted proteins were further purified by SEC into a buffer containing either 25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol and 1 mM CaCl2, or 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl and 1 mM CaCl2. Recombinant NA proteins derived from A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) (Catalog #NR-19234), A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (Catalog #NR-43779) and A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (Catalog #NR19237) were obtained from BEI ResourcesNegative stain EM sample preparation and analysisNS-EM and particle image averaging were used to assess whether the head domains of recombinant NA proteins adopted the open or closed tetrameric structure. Proteins were diluted to between 0.01–0.02 mg mL−1 using either 10 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl or 10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, either with or without 1 mM CaCl2. Samples were adsorbed to glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grids. The grids were either washed with a drop of the same buffer three times and stained with 0.75% uranyl formate, or blotted and stained directly with 0.75% uranyl formate. Images were recorded with sampling ranging between 1.9 Å/pixel and 2.2 Å/pixel, depending on the microscope. Data were collected on either an FEI Tecnai T20 electron microscope equipped with an FEI Eagle CCD camera and operated at 200 kV using SerialEM79, or on an FEI Tecnai 12 Spirit 120 kV electron microscope equipped with a Gatan Ultrascan 4000 CCD camera. Particles were selected from the micrographs automatically using either in-house software (Yaroslav Tsybovsky, unpublished) or were picked in a reference-free manner in cisTEM80. For the latter datasets, particles were extracted after correcting for the effect of the CTF for each micrograph with cisTEM80. Depending on user, dataset, and microscope, particles were either extracted into 120 × 120-pixel boxes with a final pixel size of 2.2 Å/pixel, or extracted into 230 × 230-pixel boxes with a final pixel size of 2.2 Å/pixel, or extracted with a box size of 176 × 176 pixels and binned to a final box size of 44 × 44 pixels (to a pixel size of 6.4 Å/pixel). Reference-free 2D classification was performed using either Relion 1.4 or Relion 3.1 (refs. 81,82). Representative 2D class averages for all datasets were chosen based on the unambiguous identification of NA particle quality and conformational state, with qualitative descriptions based on overall class average appearance and/or semiquantitative measurements of particles assigned to each class when distinct populations could be reliably measured. A designation of “predominantly closed” NA variants were assigned to samples with 2D class averages of the closed state comprising >80% of well-resolved NA tetramers, with open or poorly resolvable classes containing the remaining <20% of particles. “Mostly closed” was assigned to NA variants where roughly three-quarters of particles were classified into the closed conformation. “Mostly open” was assigned when roughly one-quarter of particles were observed as closed. “Predominantly open” was assigned for samples with clearly >80% of resolvable particles being classified in an open conformation. “Mixed” was assigned to any sample in between “mostly closed” and “mostly open”. Representative electron micrographs and complete sets of 2D class averages are provided in Supplementary Data 2 for each NA.Thermal denaturation and static light scatteringNon-equilibrium melting temperatures were determined using an UNcle (UNchained Labs) based on the barycentric mean of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra collected from 20–95 °C using a thermal ramp of 1 °C per minute in buffers of 25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 5% glycerol supplemented with either 1 mM CaCl2 or 5 mM EDTA. Static light scattering (SLS) data were simultaneously collected. Melting temperatures were defined as the maximum point of the first derivative of the melting curve, with first derivatives calculated using GraphPad Prism software after smoothing with four neighboring points using 2nd order polynomial settings. Aggregation temperatures were defined as the first positive data point above baseline of the first derivative of SLS, with the first derivative similarly calculated using GraphPad Prism.Enzymatic activityNeuraminidase activity was measured with the NA-FluorTM Influenza Neuraminidase Assay Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, which contains 4 mM CaCl2 in final preparations used for measurement. Briefly, two-fold serial dilutions of each NA protein were made in a black 96-well, flat bottom plate, starting from protein stocks at concentrations of 25–50 µg/mL. The wells in column 12 were left empty for background controls. NA-Fluor Substrate was prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol and added to each well. Plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and reactions were stopped with NA-Fluor Stop Solution. Plates were read using an excitation wavelength range of 350–365 nm and an emission wavelength range of 440–460 nm. Background control wells were subtracted for each protein serial dilution. Protein concentrations were plotted versus relative fluorescence unit (RFU) values.Structure-based design using RosettaAll calculations in Rosetta were made using versions v2017.18-dev59451, v2019.21-dev60746, or v2019.45-dev61026. For design of N1 CA09 sNAps, residue positions were manually sorted into spaces A, B, C, and D based on perceived local interactions in the inter-protomeric interface of N1-CA09-WT (PDB ID 4B7Q). The sequence of PDB ID 4B7Q contains an additional Y351F mutation compared to the sequence used for N1-CA09-WT, which was maintained in all designs. Based on either amino acid appearing at this position in multiple closed and open constructs described in this manuscript, we do not expect that this mutation has an impact on closure. Representative structures of N2 (PDB ID 6BR5), N3 (PDB ID 4HZV), N4 (PDB ID 2HTV), and N5 (PDB ID 3TI8) NAs were analyzed and residue identities at each of the positions were recorded. The four-fold symmetry axis of N1-CA09-WT was aligned with [0,0,1] and a single protomer was saved in.pdb format. A design protocol was written using RosettaScripts63 that takes the aligned protomer and a custom resfile as inputs, with the resfile dictating the side chain identities and conformations sampled during design (Supplementary Data 3). Briefly, the protocol applies two rounds of design based on the input resfile, with side-chain and backbone energy minimization applied after each design step. Both design and minimization steps were allowed to repack or minimize residues within 5 Å of all mutable or packable residues listed in the resfile. Multiple resfiles were set up for each space. One set of resfiles was designed to place specific substitutions from N2 (PDB ID 4H52), N3, N4, or N5 NA structures into N1-CA09-WT using the ‘PIKAA’ option. Other sets used the ‘PIKAA’ option to allow Rosetta’s packer to choose between residue identities from the N1, N2, N3, N4, or N5 NAs. A final set used the ‘PIKAA’ option to add further residue identities that were not observed in the N1, N2, N3, N4, or N5 structures to identify novel mutations. Design models and scores were manually inspected to identify interactions across the interface that appeared structurally feasible. Mutations were discarded if they buried polar groups that were natively solvent-exposed or involved in hydrogen bonds. To prevent undesired alterations to antigenicity, mutations to surface-exposed residues were not frequently considered. Favorable interactions were iteratively retested in resfiles and manually refined to finalize a diverse set of designs for each space. Twenty-six designs targeted individual spaces, while six designs consisted of combinations of designs to all four spaces that were manually picked and combined.A slightly modified protocol was used to design N1 MI15 sNAps that contained additional mutations in space D. Due to the lack of a crystal structure for N1 MI15, N1 CA09 (PDB-ID 4B7Q) was used as a template for a homology model. All design trajectories were performed while adding sNAp-155 mutations (I99P, Y100L, C161V, E165S, S172A, V177I, S196T, V205I, Q408M, R419V) in addition to mutational differences between N1 CA09 and N1 MI15 (N200S, V241I, N248D, V264I, N270K, I314M, I321V, N369K, N386K, K432E). Beyond those mutations, the design process focused entirely on residues within space D with resfile inputs drawn from either crystal structures of other non-bat NA subtypes or other identities not naturally observed in all subtypes. Disulfide mutations were designed outside of Rosetta based on distances between pairs of residues.Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometryFor each time point, 40 pmol of N1-CA09-WT and N1-CA09-sNAp-130 were incubated in deuterated buffer (85% D2O, pH* 7.4) for 3, 60, 1,800, or 72,000 s at room temperature and subsequently mixed with an equal volume of ice-cold quench buffer (4 M urea, 200 mM tris(2-chlorethyl) phosphate (TCEP), 0.2% formic acid) to a final pH* of 2.5. Samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 °C until analysis. Fully deuterated samples were prepared by digesting 40 pmol of undeuterated sample over a pepsin column, followed by concentration under vacuum, resuspension in deuterated buffer at 65 °C for 1 hour, and then quenching/freezing. Zero time point samples were prepared as previously described83. A 3 s exchange was performed at the beginning and end of the longest exchange reaction to monitor protein stability under the experiment conditions. Online pepsin digestion was performed and analyzed by LC-MS-IMS utilizing a Waters Synapt G2-Si Q-TOF mass spectrometer as previously described83. Deuterium uptake analysis was performed using HX-Express v2 (refs. 84,85). The relative deuterium exchange was corrected for in-exchange using the zero time point. Internal exchange standards (Pro-Pro-Pro-Ile [PPPI] and Pro-Pro-Pro-Phe [PPPF]) were included in each reaction to ensure that conditions were consistent throughout all of the labeling reactions.Cryo-electron microscopy sample preparation, data collection, and image processingsNAp proteins were diluted to 1–1.5 μM in buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) and 3 μL sample loaded onto a freshly glow-discharged 1.2/1.2 UltrAuFoil grid (300 mesh) prior to plunge freezing using a vitrobot Mark IV (ThermoFisher Scientific) with a blot force of −1 and 3.5–4.5 s blot time at 100% humidity and 4 °C.Data were acquired on an FEI Glacios transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV and equipped with a Gatan K2 Summit direct detector. Automated data collection was carried out using Leginon86 at a nominal magnification of 36,000× with a pixel size of 1.16 Å. The dose rate was adjusted to 8 counts/pixel/s, and each movie was acquired in counting mode fractionated in 50 frames of 200 ms. For the N1-CA09-sNAp-c155 and N1-MI15-sNAp-174 complexes, 1,034 and 1,099 micrographs were collected, respectively, with a defocus range between −0.5 and −2.5 µm. For the N1-CA09-WT complex, 605 micrographs were collected with a defocus range between −1.0 and −3.0 µm. Movie frame alignment, estimation of microscope CTF parameters, and automatic particle picking and extraction were carried out using Warp87. Particles were extracted unbinned into a box size of 204 pixels.For the N1-CA09-WT dataset, three rounds of reference-free 2D classification were performed using cryoSPARC88. After each round, well-defined images corresponding to NA tetramers were selected and re-classified until 2D classification stabilized. For the N1-CA09-sNAp-c155 and N1-MI15-sNAp-c174 datasets, two rounds of reference-free 2D classification were performed in cryoSPARC, again selecting for well-defined images. Particles selected post-2D classification were subjected to two rounds of 3D classification in Relion89 without imposing symmetry (angular sampling 7.5° for 25 iterations followed by 1.8° with local searches for a further 25 iterations). For each dataset, ab initio models were generated in cryoSPARC as reference maps for 3D classification88. Refinements of 3D maps were carried out using non-uniform refinement along with per-particle defocus refinement as implemented in cryoSPARC90. Particles were transferred back into Relion to perform Bayesian polishing81,91 before an additional round of non-uniform refinement, per-particle defocus refinement, and finally one more round of non-uniform refinement imposing four-fold symmetry. Local resolution estimation, filtering, and sharpening were carried out in cryoSPARC92. All reported resolutions were determined using gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) calculations with a cutoff criterion of 0.143 (ref. 93) and FSC curves were corrected for the effects of soft masking by high-resolution noise substitution94.Cryo-EM model building and analysisUCSF Chimera95 and Coot96 were used to fit atomic models (PDB ID 4B7Q) into the cryoEM maps and point mutations were made manually in Coot. Models were refined and relaxed using Rosetta using both sharpened and unsharpened maps97,98 and validated using Molprobity99, Phenix100, and EMRinger101. Figures were generated using UCSF ChimeraX102.Collection of NA sequences and entropy calculationsComprehensive sequence datasets for each NA subtype were downloaded from GISAID (www.gisaid.org). Each dataset included animal and human sequences longer than 1,350 nucleotides deposited before January 14, 2020. Sequences were aligned using Mafft v7 for large numbers of short sequences103. Sequences with more than 135 ambiguous bases or large gaps were eliminated. To calculate amino acid frequencies, we truncated NA sequences to retain only the globular head of NA ectodomain. Unique amino acid sequences of the NA head domain were selected using CD-HIT with the “Sequence identity cut-off” set at 1.0 (ref. 104). Sequence logos were generated using WebLogo 3 (ref. 105), http://weblogo.threeplusone.com/). From aligned sequences containing gaps, entropy calculations were measured using the dms_tools2 python library (https://jbloomlab.github.io/dms_tools2/). Representative positions for maximum and mean entropies were the individual positions with entropy values that were highest or closest to the mean calculated using all positions in a given sequence, respectively.Biolayer interferometryAll biosensors were hydrated in PBS prior to use. Recombinant NA tetramers were immobilized on HIS2 biosensors (fortéBio) through their hexahistidine tags. After briefly dipping in assay buffer (25 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1% BSA) supplemented with either 1 mM CaCl2 or 5 mM EDTA, the biosensors were dipped in a two-fold dilution series of IgG for 5 min. Starting concentration of 1G01 and CD6 was 400 nM and 100 nM, respectively. Biosensors were then dipped in the assay buffer (with either CaCl2 or EDTA) to allow IgG to dissociate from NA for 10 min. All assay steps were performed at 30 °C with agitation set at 1,000 rpm in the Octet HTX instrument (fortéBio). Correction to subtract non-specific baseline drift was carried out by subtracting the measurements recorded for a sensor loaded with the NA in the same buffer with no antibody. Data analysis and curve fitting were carried out using Octet analysis software (version 11). Experimental data were fitted with the binding equations describing a 2:1 (bivalent binding) interaction. Global analyses of the complete data sets assuming binding was reversible (full dissociation) were carried out using nonlinear least-squares fitting allowing a single set of binding parameters to be obtained simultaneously for all concentrations used in each experiment.Virus generationA/California 07/2009 H1N1 influenza reporter virus was rescued by reverse genetics of eight-plasmid system with HA and NA segments of CA09 and internal gene segments of A/WSN/1933 except for PB1 segment which was replaced with reporter gene (tdKatushka2). To generate the virus with stabilized NA, NA segment was modified to incorporate sNAP-155 mutations and used the modified NA segment for virus rescue in 293 T cells transiently expressing viral PB1 and TMPRSS2. Both viruses with WT NA and with stabilized NA were propagated in MDCK-SIAT1 cells constitutively expressing PB1 as described69. Both viruses were passaged ten times prior to assessing growth kinetics. For virus growth kinetics, pretitrated viruses were added to MDCK-SIAT1-PB1 cells (preseeded at 1 × 105 cells/ml) in OptiMEM with 1 µg/ml of TPCK-treated trypsin in a 384-well black plate (final 50 µl/well) with the transparent bottom (Greiner). Viral growth was measured at 8, 18, 21, 23, and 42 hours postinfection by counting fluorescent foci using Celigo Image Cytometer (Nexcelom) with a customized red channel for optimal detection of the tdKatushka2 reporter. In Celigo operation and analysis software v4.1, Target 1 protocol was used to detect and count fluorescent foci.Flow cytometryCells were transfected as described earlier in Methods using PEI-MAX and harvested 24 hours post-transfection. Cells were collected, passed through a 70 µm nylon mesh filter, and counted for concentration and viability according to the manufacturer’s instructions (ThermoFisher Countess). Cells were split into two groups per sample and washed twice with buffer (25 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 2.5% glycerol) or the same buffer supplemented with 5 mM EDTA (buffer-EDTA). Cells were incubated with 1 µL ZombieViolet (Biolegend #423114) per 1 million cells for 10 minutes at room temperature. Cells were washed twice in buffer or buffer-EDTA, both containing 1% w/v BSA. Cells were aliquoted into 96-well flow cytometry plates (2 × 105 cells per well) and centrifuged. The supernatant was removed and the cells were resuspended with buffer containing 1% BSA. A 1:400 dilution of antimyc antibody (9E10; Abcam ab202008), 200 nM CD6 or 1G01 antibody fluorescently labeled according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher A20188), or both antimyc antibody and one of the anti-NA antibodies was added to the resuspended cells. Samples were incubated at 4 degrees C for 30 minutes, washed twice, incubated in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes at room temperature, washed twice, and stored on ice until analysis on an Attune NxT flow cytometer. The flow cytometry data was analyzed with FlowJo version 10.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.

Álvarez, County of San Diego Communications OfficeApr. 6, 2022 | 10:18 AMApr. 6, 2022 | 10:18 AM Reading Time: 2 minutesAn additional 157 lab-confirmed influenza cases were reported in the region last week, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today. That is up from 121 reported the previous week. To date, 2,098 infections have been reported in San Diego County, compared to 752 at the same time last season. In comparison, the prior five-year average was 11,218 cases by the same week. “While overall cases remain low despite the increase, influenza can result in serious illness, especially for older adults and the very young,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “If you have not gotten a flu vaccine this season, it’s not too late to do it.” The flu vaccine is especially important for people at higher risk of having serious complications from the virus. They include: People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control Pregnant women People aged 65 years and older People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk The latest Influenza Watch Report from the County Health and Human Services Agency shows the following for the week ending April 2, 2022: Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 3% of all visits (compared with 3% the previous week). Lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 157 (compared to 121 the previous week). Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 2,098 (compared to 752 at the same time last season and a 11,218 prior 5-year average during the same week). Influenza-related deaths reported to date: 4 (compared to 2 at the same time last year). Tips to Prevent the Flu The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time, including a booster dose. The coronavirus vaccine does not work against influenza and vice versa. The influenza vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego. In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick: Wash hands thoroughly and often; Use hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands; Stay away from sick people; Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth; Clean commonly touched surfaces; and If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others. During the 2020-2021 flu season, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. During the 2019-2020 flu season, more than 20,700 flu cases were reported and 108 San Diegans died from influenza. Related: fluflu shotflu vaccineinfluenza José A.

Jeff Goulden/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Jeff Goulden/Getty Images Waterfowl and the raptors that dine on them, like this bald eagle and snow goose, have both been killed by the new bird flu virus. Jeff Goulden/Getty Images A newly arrived bird flu is sweeping through wild bird populations in the United States, and that may mean trouble for poultry farmers who have been doing their best to control this flu outbreak in their flocks. Some 24 million poultry birds like chicken and turkeys have already been lost, either because they died from the virus or were killed to prevent its spread. But unlike a similar bird flu outbreak seven years ago, this one is unlikely to just burn itself out. That's because this particular flu virus seems capable of hanging around in populations of wild birds, which can pass the virus on to poultry farms. While chickens and turkeys with the virus quickly sicken and die, some waterfowl can remain healthy with the virus and carry it long distances. Sponsor Message Scientists believe that wild migratory birds brought this virus to North America a few months ago. Since then, more than 40 wild bird species in more than 30 states have tested positive. This strain of bird flu virus has turned up in everything from crows to pelicans to bald eagles. "It's somewhat surprising how widespread it is already in North America," says Jonathan Runstadler, an influenza researcher at Tufts University. "It's clearly able to persist and transmit from year to year in parts of Asia, Europe, Africa, and I don't think we should be surprised if that's going to be the case here." As the virus moves across the country, and potentially settles in for the long haul, it will encounter new animal species that could get infected. This pathogen will also get a chance to genetically mingle with the flu viruses that are already circulating in the U.S. "What that means for the virus in terms of how it evolves, how it changes, we just don't really know," says Richard Webby, a flu researcher at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Animals Researchers suspect humans gave COVID to deer. And it once spilled back into a person There has been only one known human case So far, the risk to humans seems low. But since related bird flu viruses have repeatedly jumped into people in the past, public health experts are watching for any signs of genetic changes that could make the virus able to move into humans. "We're concerned with any avian influenza virus that's circulating in domestic poultry or wild birds," says Todd Davis, an expert on animal-to-human diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). "Because humans have no prior immunity to these viruses typically, if they were to be infected and spread the virus to other humans, then we could have another pandemic virus on our hands." Sponsor Message This virus doesn't have genetic features previously associated with related bird flus that have infected humans. And the only person known to have contracted this particular bird flu virus was an elderly person in the United Kingdom who lived in close quarters with ducks; while some of the ducks got sick and died, their owner never had any symptoms. The CDC has been monitoring the health of more than 500 people in 25 states who were exposed to infected birds, says Davis. Although a few dozen people did develop flu-like symptoms, all were tested and none were positive for this virus. Animals An outbreak of bird flu is pushing poultry prices higher Raptors could be especially hard hit Wildlife experts have long known that highly pathogenic bird flus like this one were circulating in Europe and Asia. And they have worried about the possible threat these viruses might pose to American birds. Then, in December of 2021, chickens and other fowl got sick and started dying on a farm on the island of Newfoundland, Canada. Tests showed this deadly bird flu virus had made it across the Atlantic. "The very first moment it got to North America, it was a heads up to us," says Bryan Richards, the emerging diseases coordinator at the U.S. Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center. In January, government officials announced its arrival in the U.S. after a wigeon duck in South Carolina tested positive. The last time a dangerous bird flu entered the country, Richards says, "the number of instances where we picked that particular virus up in wild birds was very, very limited." In contrast, this latest bird flu virus is being detected in sick and dying birds all over. "This outbreak in the wild bird population is a lot more extensive than we saw in 2014 and 2015," says David Stallknecht, an avian influenza researcher with the University of Georgia. "Just a lot more birds appear to be affected." Sponsor Message Waterfowl, and raptors that eat their dead bodies, are bearing the brunt of it. In Florida, for example, more than 1,000 lesser scaup ducks have succumbed to the virus. In New Hampshire, about 50 Canada geese died in a single event. In the Great Plains states, wildlife experts have seen mass die-offs in snow geese. "In addition, there's a host of other species, including black vultures and bald eagles and some of the other scavenging species, that were likely infected by consuming the carcasses of those waterfowl," says Richards. It remains to be seen how much of a toll this virus will take on American bird species. In Israel, when this virus hit an area where about 40,000 common cranes had gathered for the winter, "they lost a reported 8,000 of these birds over the course of a couple weeks," says Richards. "So when you start thinking about losing 20% of a specific population of wild birds, that's a pretty substantial impact." Poultry farmers cull their flocks Chickens and turkeys raised by the poultry industry have suffered the most deaths, and farmers are bracing themselves for even more. The bird flu that struck in 2014 and 2015 resulted in the deaths of more than 50 million birds and cost the industry billions of dollars. Back then, the greatest number of cases occurred in the month of April. "So I think I am kind of holding my breath this month," says Denise Heard, director of research programs for the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association. The virus has a number of ways to get from wild birds into poultry, says Heard. Since the last outbreak, the industry has worked to educate farmers about how to protect their flocks. "Wild migratory waterfowl are always flying over the top and when they poop, that poop gets on the ground," she says, explaining that the virus can then get tracked into bird houses on boots or inadvertently moved from farm to farm on vehicles. Sponsor Message Heard says there currently seems to be less spread of the virus from farm to farm than was seen during the last major outbreak. Instead, there are more isolated cases popping up, perhaps because wild birds are bringing the viruses to farms and backyard flocks. If this virus sticks around in wild bird populations — which some scientists think is likely — poultry farmers may need to just learn to live with this problem. "I hope that this is not the case. I hope that in the U.S. this infection will die off soon, and the virus will go away again like it did in 2014," says Ron Fouchier, a virologist at Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands. "But there's no guarantee for that, as we've seen in Europe now that this virus has remained present for several years in a row." Since December, farmers in Europe have had to cull more than 17 million birds. "So that's very similar to the situation in the U.S.," says Fouchier. "And we are seeing massive die-offs in wild birds."

In a Phase 1 study, OVX836, administered intramuscularly, has been found safe and immunogenic. The 90µg and 180µg dose levels were selected to be further evaluated in this randomized, monocenter, reference-controlled (Influvac Tetra™: quadrivalent seasonal influenza subunit vaccine), parallel group, double-blind, Phase 2a study in 300 healthy volunteers, aged 18-65 years, during the 2019/2020 flu season. Safety, influenza-like illness episodes (ILI; based on the Flu-PRO® questionnaire) and immunogenicity were assessed up to 180 days post-vaccination. OVX836 was safe and presented a reactogenicity profile similar to Influvac Tetra. It induced a significant increase in terms of NP-specific interferon-gamma (IFNγ) spot forming cells (SFCs), NP-specific CD4+ T-cells (essentially polyfunctional cells) and anti-NP IgG responses. OVX836 was superior to Influvac Tetra for all immunological parameters related to NP, and the 180µg dose was significantly superior to the 90µg dose for SFCs and CD4+ T-cells expressing IFNγ. Both the CD4+ T-cell and the anti-NP IgG responses persisted up to Day 180. An efficacy signal was observed with OVX836 at 180µg through reduction of ILI episodes occurring during the flu season as of 14 days post-vaccination. In conclusion, these results encourage further clinical evaluation of OVX836 in order to confirm the signal of efficacy on ILIs and/or laboratory-confirmed influenza cases. NCT04192500 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT04192500)IntroductionInfluenza infection is a major cause of severe respiratory disease that affects all age groups, leading to 290,000 to 650,000 worldwide deaths annually (1).Tetravalent influenza vaccines generating an antibody immune response mostly directed against the highly drifting hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) envelope glycoproteins of the virus are the cornerstone of today’s influenza prevention (2). During the 2019/2020 influenza season, six influenza studies across Europe have indicated that vaccine effectiveness (VE) against any laboratory-confirmed influenza, across all ages, in primary care and hospital settings, ranged between 29% and 61%. VE estimates against influenza A/H3N2 were substantially lower (-58% to 57%) than against influenza A/H1N1 pdm09 (48% to 75%) and against influenza B (62 to 83%), while influenza A/H3N2 is generally associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Negative VE estimates for H3N2 could be due to immunological imprinting by first flu infection in childhood (3). There is therefore a need for vaccine efficacy improvement.In addition to humoral immunity, cellular responses, in particular CD4 and CD8-mediated responses, very likely contribute to vaccine-induced protection (4–10). More specifically, in the Flu Watch Cohort Study, nucleoprotein (NP) specific T-cell levels above a threshold of 20 Spot Forming Cells [SFC]/million peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMC] at baseline measurement correlated with fewer cases of symptomatic, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive influenza A, during both pandemic and seasonal influenza periods (11). As an internal protein, providing structural and functional support to the viral replication machinery (12), the influenza NP has a relatively low mutation rate throughout virus evolution (13, 14). The NP proteins of various virus isolates of the same influenza A subtype had over 90% amino acid homology (14, 15). Taken together, these data support the use of NP as a target to develop a broad-spectrum vaccine for the protection against influenzaOVX836 (OSIVAX, Lyon, France) is a universal vaccine candidate that demonstrated broad protection against multiple influenza A strains (16) and also cross-protection against B strains (unpublished data) in preclinical viral challenge models. OVX836 is a recombinant protein containing the full-length NP of the A/WSN/1933(H1N1) influenza virus and OVX313 (oligoDOM®), OSIVAX’s proprietary self-assembling nanoparticle technology (16, 17). This recombinant protein spontaneously assembles to form positively charged nanoparticles composed of 7 copies of the NP fused to OVX313.Animal studies have demonstrated the ability of OVX836 to elicit humoral and cellular immunity – including tissue-resident and long-lasting CD8+ T-cells in the lungs - as well as protection in mice and ferrets against influenza A and B challenges (16, 18).The results of a Phase 1, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study have recently been published (19). When administered by the intramuscular (IM) route, OVX836 was safe and well-tolerated at 30µg, 90µg and 180µg, administered as a two-dose schedule with one month interval. A single injection of OVX836 was able to significantly increase the number of NP-specific T-cells at Day 8 and titers of anti-NP IgG at Day 29. The second vaccination (28 days after the first) did not amplify the immune response. There was no clear dose-effect relationship between 30µg, 90µg and 180µg. However, a dose of 30µg was considered potentially insufficient to induce a strong and persistent immune response, especially in populations with weakened immunity, such as older adults. Therefore, OVX836 dose levels of 90µg and 180µg were selected to be further evaluated in a Phase 2a study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04192500; EudraCT number 2019-002939-28; IND number 19276), the object of the current paper.Materials and MethodsThis randomized, reference-controlled, double-blind Phase 2a study was performed at one single center, the Center for Vaccinology (CEVAC, Ghent University and University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium), in accordance with Good Clinical Practice. It was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Ghent University Hospital and by the Belgian Federal Agency for Medicines and Health Products (FAMHP). All participants gave their written informed consent.Three hundred healthy adult men and women, aged 18-65 years were included in this study.The exclusion criteria were body mass index ≥35 kg/m², active smoking (more than 10 cigarettes/day), and pregnancy or unwillingness to practice birth control. Any known or suspected immunodeficient conditions, autoimmune disorders or chronic diseases, or presence of an acute febrile illness on the day of vaccination led to exclusion, as well as previous influenza vaccination within 6 months before screening, vaccination within 3 or 1 month prior to the day of study vaccination for live attenuated or inactivated vaccines, respectively. Subjects taking treatments that could affect the immune response (systemic corticosteroids, cytotoxic drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs and other immunomodulatory drugs) were also excluded.Participants (N=300) were stratified in two age strata (18-49 year-old subjects representing 65-70% and 50-65 year-old subjects representing 30-35% of the overall cohort) and randomized (1:1:1) into 3 groups of 100 subjects who received a single IM injection (deltoid muscle of the non-dominant arm) of either OVX836 at 90µg (300 µg/mL; 0.3 mL), OVX836 at 180µg (300 µg/mL; 0.6 mL) or a quadrivalent seasonal influenza subunit vaccine (Influvac Tetra™, Mylan; 2019-2020 season, 0.5mL dose) (Supplementary Figure 1). Influvac Tetra is not expected to contain NP (20) and was therefore chosen as placebo-like comparator for the immunogenicity analysis, without the ethical constraints of a real placebo. Safety monitoring consisted of a 7-day post-vaccination follow-up period for solicited local (injection site pain, redness and swelling) and systemic signs and symptoms (fatigue, headache, arthralgia, malaise, myalgia and fever [oral temperature]) using an electronic diary (eDiary), a 28-day follow-up period for unsolicited adverse events (AEs), and a 180-day follow-up period for serious AEs (SAEs) and ILI to detect potential Vaccine-Associated Respiratory Disease. The grading of solicited signs and symptoms was performed in accordance with FDA guidance (https://www.fda.govegulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documentsoxicity-grading-scale-healthy-adult-and-adolescent-volunteers-enrolled-preventive-vaccine-clinical), with slight modifications. Subjects had to visit the clinical site on Day 1 (injection day, visit 1) and on Days 8 (visit 2), 29 (visit 3) and 180 (visit 4, end of study visit) post-injection. Missed visits due to containment measures for the COVID-19 pandemic implemented at the start of the study (on 19 March 2020), were replaced by duly documented phone contacts. PBMC samples were collected at each visit to measure NP-specific T-cell responses (interferon-gamma [IFNγ] enzyme-linked immunospot assay [ELISPOT], and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells expressing IFNγ, interleukin-2 [IL-2] and/or tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNFα] by flow cytometry, according to the gating strategy as described in Supplementary Figure 2). Immunoassays are described in the Supplementary Methods.Subjects presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI) were requested to return to the investigational site as soon as possible for laboratory confirmation of influenza infection (RT-PCR assay performed on nasopharyngeal [NPh] swabs) and to monitor the severity of the disease until resolution of symptoms using the Flu-PRO® questionnaire (21). Due to unavailability of NPh swab samples in some subjects as a result of containment measures for the COVID-19 pandemic, hemagglutination inhibition assays (HAI specific of A/H1N1/Brisbane/02/2018 and A/H3N2/Kansas/14/2017 strains, two strains representative of those that circulated most during 2019-20 influenza season) were performed on Day 1 and Day 180 samples of OVX836 groups as additional means to identify influenza infection as causal agent of the ILI episode. A four-fold increase in HAI titers between Day 1 and Day 180 was considered indicative of an influenza infection. In the Influvac Tetra cohort, where the vaccine induced a rise in HAI titers, a four-fold increase between Day 1 and Day 180 in anti-NP IgG was considered as a serological marker of influenza infection (22, 23).The epidemiological data from Sciensano (Belgian Institute for Public Health), namely the percentage of laboratory-confirmed flu positive samples (Supplementary Figure 3), were used to define the flu season as the period between 02 December 2019 and 09 March 2020 (weeks during which percentage of lab-confirmed influenza cases was above 20%) (24).The study was designed to detect a difference of 2.3 between mean ratios (Day 8/Day 1; primary endpoint) for Influvac Tetra (1.0) and for OVX836 (3.3) in the NP-specific IFNγ SFC counts measured by ELISPOT, assuming that the common standard deviation was 4.0, using a two group t-test with a 0.017 (Bonferroni’s correction for three comparisons) two-sided alpha significance level. A sample size of 83 subjects in each group would have 90% power to detect such a difference. To account for potential dropouts, a total of 100 subjects per group were included in the study.SAS (Version 9.4) was used for the statistical analyses. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize all relevant parameters and the balance between the three treatment groups at baseline was confirmed. Continuous variables were analyzed using analyses of variance for repeated measures (PROC MIXED) with the factor ‘time’, ‘treatment group or age strata’, and interaction of both factors as fixed factors. When justified, the appropriate post-hoc intergroup and intragroup comparisons were performed. Discrete variables were analyzed using logistic regression analysis (PROC LOG) with a multiplicity correction for post-hoc pairwise comparisons. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank tests were used to compare the time elapsed between vaccination and occurrence of ILIs in the three treatment groups.ResultsDemographic and Baseline CharacteristicsThree hundred subjects (208 aged 18-49 years and 92 aged 50-65 years) were vaccinated between 11 December 2019 and 09 March 2020 (100, 101 and 99 with OVX836 90µg, OVX836 180µg and Influvac Tetra, respectively); all were included in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) cohort (Supplementary Figure 4). All subjects completed the study and had samples taken on Day 8 (primary endpoint). Due to the COVID-19 containment measures (replacement of visits by phone contacts), samples for the immunogenicity analyses on Day 29 could only be taken in 227 participants (per protocol [PP] cohort: 78, 73 and 76 in the OVX836 90µg, OVX836 180µg and Influvac Tetra group, respectively).Demographic data and baseline characteristics of the 300 study participants are shown in Supplementary Table 1.OVX836 Induced Significant Increase of NP-Specific Cellular Immune Responses and Anti-NP IgG TitersIn the 227 subjects of the PP cohort, the mean ± SD (median) Day 8/Day 1 NP-specific IFNγ SFC ratio was 2.92 ± 3.04 (1.83) in the OVX836 90µg group, 2.66 ± 2.21 (1.93) in the OVX836 180µg group and 1.51 ± 1.55 (1.03) in the Influvac Tetra group. The overall mean difference between groups was significant (p<0.001; ANOVA). Planned post-hoc tests revealed significant differences between OVX836 90µg and Influvac Tetra (p<0.001, Bonferroni’s test), as well as between OVX836 180µg and Influvac Tetra (p<0.01), without significant difference between the two OVX836 dose levels on this parameter. The primary endpoint of the study was therefore met.The NP-specific IFNγ SFC responses in all subjects, subjects aged 18-49 years and subjects aged 50-65 years are shown in Figure 1. Differences between OVX836 180µg and Influvac Tetra were significant (p<0.05) on Days 8 and 29 in all subjects and in the two separate age strata. Subjects aged 50-65 years showed a higher response to OVX836 180µg than to OVX836 90µg.FIGURE 1 Figure 1 Evolution over time of the number of nucleoprotein (NP)-specific interferon-gamma (IFNγ) spot forming cells (SFCs) per million of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) between baseline (Day 1 – pre-vaccination) and Day 180 (post-vaccination) in the three treatment groups (Influvac Tetra™, OVX836 90µg and OVX836 180µg; per protocol cohort). Results are shown as mean ± standard error; paired comparisons between each timepoint post-vaccination and baseline (Day 1): *p<0.05; ****p<0.0001. Panel (A) corresponds to all subjects, Panel (B) to subjects aged 18-49 years and Panel (C) to subjects aged 50-65 years.The anti-NP IgG responses are shown in Supplementary Figure 5. There was a significant increase in titers on Day 8, peaking at Day 29 and lasting up to Day 180 with OVX836 at both doses compared to Influvac Tetra. In subjects aged 18-49 years no dose effect of OVX836 on anti-NP IgG responses was observed throughout the observation period. In subjects aged 50-65 years OVX836 at 180µg elicited a higher anti-NP IgG response only on Day 29 as compared to 90µg dose. The persistence of the responses did not differ between older and younger subjects.No clear correlations were found between the NP-specific humoral and cellular responses (SFCs and CD4+ T-cell responses), all correlation coefficients being inferior to 0.5 (data not shown).OVX836 Vaccination Increased Polyfunctionality of CD4+ T-CellsThe percentage of CD4+ T-cells expressing at least IFNγ in all subjects, and split in subjects aged 18-49 years and aged 50-65 years, is shown in Supplementary Figure 6. The percentage of NP-specific CD4+ T-cells with the different profiles of expression of IFNγ, IL-2 and TNFα in the three treatment groups and at the different timepoints is shown in Figure 2. The baseline level was low (median ranging around 0.005%) in the three groups and no increase was observed in the Influvac Tetra group. Both dose levels of OVX836 induced a significant CD4+ response on Days 8 and 29. In subjects aged 18-49 years the peak response was observed on Day 8 whereas in subjects aged 50-65 years (Supplementary Figure 6) the response peaked on Day 29. The CD4 response was predominantly polyfunctional with most CD4+ T-cells co-expressing three (IL-2/TNFα/IFNγ) and two (IL-2/IFNγ) cytokines, in addition to CD4+ cells expressing IFNγ only. The evolution over time of polyfunctional CD4+ T-cells was relatively similar in subjects aged 18-49 years and in subjects aged 50-65 years (data not shown).FIGURE 2 Figure 2 Frequencies of nucleoprotein (NP)-specific CD4+ T-cells identified in vitro as expressing the combinations of cytokines: IFNγ, IL-2 and TNFα at pre-vaccination, Day 1 (D1), Day 8 (D8), Day 29 (D29) and Day 180 (D180) in the three treatment groups (Influvac Tetra™, OVX836 90µg and OVX836 180µg; modified intention-to-treat cohort). Results are shown as box plot with the horizontal central bar corresponding to the median, limits of the box corresponding to percentiles 25 and 75, and vertical bars corresponding to percentiles 10 and 90. Intragroup differences: *p<0.05, **p<0.01 and ***p<0.0001; paired t tests versus baseline. Main intergroup differences (global ANOVA with p value <0.05 at each timepoint and post-hoc t tests between OVX836 90 µg and OVX836 180 µg with p values <0.05) were as follows: - IL2+/TNFα+/IFNγ+: Day 8 global p=0.012, Day 29 global p<0.0001, Day 180 global p<0.0001. - IL2+/TNFα-/IFNγ+: Day 8 global p<0.0001, Day 29 global p<0.0001 (OVX836 180 µg versus OVX836 90 µg p=0.008), Day 180 global p<0.0001 (OVX836 180 µg versus OVX836 90 µg p=0.026). - IL2+/TNFα+/IFNγ-: Day 8 global p=0.036, Day 29 global p<0.0001, Day 180 global p<0.0001. - IL2-/TNFα+/IFNγ+: Day 8 global p<0.0001, Day 29 global p=0.001. - IL2-/TNFα-/IFNγ+: Day 8 global p<0.0001 (OVX836 90 µg versus OVX836 180 µg p=0.002), Day 29 global p<0.0001 (OVX836 90 µg versus OVX836 180 µg p<0.0001). - IL2+/TNFα-/IFNγ-: Day 8 global p<0.0001 (OVX836 90 µg versus OVX836 180 µg p=0.026), Day 29 global p<0.0001, Day 180 global p=0.003. - IL2-/TNFα+/IFNγ-: No statistically significant differences (global p values>0.05).OVX836 Increased CD8+ T-Cells Expressing at least IFNγ in Subjects With Low Baseline ValuesIn the mITT cohort, no significant increase of CD8+ T-cells was observed in any of the groups, including those given OVX836. It must be noted that baseline (Day 1) values were high (median value ranging between 0.112% and 0.121%), especially for subjects vaccinated after 30 January 2020, which may be linked to the active circulation of the influenza virus (Supplementary Figure 7A). In subjects belonging to the lowest quartile of the CD8+ response at baseline (most likely the ones with the lowest probability of recent exposure to influenza preceding vaccination), the median percentage of NP-specific CD8+ T-cells expressing IFNγ increased significantly (from 0.03% on Day 1 to 0.06% on Day 8; p=0.020) in the OVX836 180µg group only (Supplementary Figure 7B).A Dose-Response Effect Was Observed With OVX836 180µg Performing Better Than 90µgThe OVX836 dose-effect relationship in terms of SFCs, CD4+ T-cell expressing at least IFNγ and anti-NP IgG responses is illustrated, in the mITT, in Figure 3. No differences were found between the three groups at baseline (Day 1). On Day 8, a statistically significant (p<0.05 to p<0.0001) increase in the three parameters was measured with OVX836 at both doses versus Influvac Tetra. The response to OVX836 180µg was significantly higher compared to OVX836 90µg for SFCs (p=0.006) and CD4+ T-cell expressing IFNγ (p=0.007) but not significant for anti-NP IgG (p=0.085).FIGURE 3 Figure 3 Panel (A) Number of nucleoprotein (NP)-specific interferon-gamma (IFNγ) spot forming cells (SFCs) per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) at baseline (Day 1 – pre-vaccination) and Day 8 (post-vaccination) in the three treatment groups (Influvac Tetra™, OVX836 90µg and OVX836 180µg; modified intention-to-treat cohort after elimination of two outlier subjects with very high values at baseline).

Systemic signs and symptoms (all grades) were reported by 60%, 64% and 46% of subjects and signs and symptoms graded “severe” by 3%, 2% and 3% of subjects in the OVX836 90µg, OVX836 180µg and Influvac Tetra groups, respectively (Figure 4B). In the OVX836 180µg group, 4 severe systemic signs and symptoms were reported by the same subject concomitantly with a RT-PCR-confirmed influenza episode. The mean duration of all solicited signs and symptoms taken together was 1.8 ± 3.2 days in the OVX836 90μg group, 1.9 ± 3.4 days in the OVX836 180μg group and 2.5 ± 4.1 days in the Influvac Tetra group.FIGURE 4 Figure 4 Panel (A) Percentage of subjects reporting mild (light color) or moderate (dark color) solicited local signs during the 7-day post-vaccination period in the three treatment groups (Influvac Tetra™, OVX836 90µg and OVX836 180µg; modified intention-to-treat cohort corresponding to the safety cohort). Panel (B) Percentage of subjects reporting mild (light color), moderate (intermediate color) or severe (dark color) solicited systemic symptoms during the 7-day post-vaccination period in the three treatment groups and safety cohort. Panel (C) Percentage of subjects reporting unsolicited adverse events (AEs) (light color) and severe AEs (grade 3; dark color), overall and considered related to the vaccine by the investigator, during the 28-day post-vaccination period, in the three treatment groups and safety cohort.Unsolicited AEs considered related to the treatment were reported by 7%, 9% and 13% of subjects in the OVX836 90µg, OVX836 180µg and Influvac Tetra groups, respectively (Figure 4C). The most frequent AEs, affecting at least 5% of subjects were ILIs, Upper Respiratory Tract Infection, Headache, Oropharyngeal Pain and Lymphadenopathy (Supplementary Table 2). Overall, 5 SAEs were reported in 2 subjects of the OVX836 90µg group (Appendicitis and Sinus tarsi syndrome), 1 subject of the OVX836 180µg group (Thyroid cancer), and 2 subjects of the Influvac Tetra group (Radius fracture and Intervertebral disc protrusion). None of the reported SAEs was considered related to the vaccine and none of them led to study discontinuation. The reported cases of ILI did not suggest any disease enhancement by the vaccine.A First Efficacy Signal Observed With OVX836 at 180µg on the Reduction of ILI EpisodesKaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to evaluate the cumulative hazard of ILIs as a function of post-vaccination time during the influenza season (defined by Sciensano – former Belgian Scientific Institute of Public Health, as the period between 02 December 2019 and 09 March 2020) (24). A first analysis took into account all ILIs occurring during the 2019-2020 flu season (Supplementary Figure 8). The comparison between the three treatment groups was non-significant (p=0.325; log-rank test). A second analysis took into account the ILIs occurring during the same period but only from 14 days post-vaccination onward based on the assumption that the immune response will require some time after vaccination to reach protective levels. Thirteen ILIs occurred from 14 days post-vaccination onward: 8 in the OVX836 90µg group, 2 in the OVX836 180µg group and 3 in the Influvac Tetra group (Figure 5). There was a trend for a global difference between the three groups (p=0.088) and for a difference between OVX836 180µg and OVX836 90µg (p=0.054). The difference between OVX836 90µg and Influvac Tetra was not significant (p=0.130). Among these 13 ILIs, 4 (31%) were lab-confirmed influenza cases, either by RT-PCR and/or HAI seroconversion (4-fold increase) in the OVX836 groups, or anti-NP IgG seroconversion (4-fold increase) in the Influvac Tetra group: 2 in subjects of the OVX836 90µg group (1 confirmed by RT-PCR and 1 confirmed by 4-fold HAI titer increase), 0 in subjects in the OVX836 180µg group and 2 in subjects of the Influvac Tetra group (confirmed by 4-fold anti-NP IgG increase).FIGURE 5 Figure 5 Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of the cumulative risk of influenza-like illness (ILI) as a function of time between vaccination and first ILI episode (day) during the influenza season (defined as the period between 02 December 2019 and 09 March 2020), from 14 days post-vaccination onward, in the three treatment groups (Influvac Tetra™, OVX836 90µg and OVX836 180µg; modified intention-to-treat cohort corresponding to the safety cohort). Log-rank test showed a p=0.054 for the comparison between Influvac Tetra and OVX836 90µg.Twenty-three (24) ILI cases were observed during the thirteen days consecutive to vaccination, the period wherein the protective effect of the vaccine is assumed to be still very low or absent. These cases were used to examine whether an association exists between the pre-vaccination levels of NP-specific IFNγ SFCs and CD4+ T-cells (expressing at least IFNγ) and the risk of developing an ILI in the overall population (three groups pooled together). NP-specific IFNγ SFCs were 150 ± 184 and 69 ± 49 SFC/million PBMCs (p<0.001) in subjects who did not report any ILI and subjects who reported at least one ILI, respectively. A significant difference was also found for NP-specific CD4+ T-cells expressing at least IFNγ (0.034 ± 0.034% versus 0.022 ± 0.011%; p<0.0001) (Supplementary Table 3).DiscussionA single IM injection of 90µg or 180µg of the OVX836 vaccine candidate was safe and well-tolerated. This confirms the observations made during the Phase 1 study (19). The overall safety profile, in terms of nature, intensity and duration of local and systemic signs and symptoms, was very similar to that of the tetravalent reference vaccine Influvac Tetra. No severe adverse events attributable to OVX836 were observed, suggesting that the maximum tolerated dose was not reached in this study.A single dose of OVX836 at 90µg or 180µg was able to significantly increase the NP-specific IFNγ SFCs, the polyfunctional and IFNγ secreting CD4+ T-cells and the anti-NP IgG level in both the 18-49 years-old and the 50-65 years-old subjects. The persistence of these humoral and cellular immune responses was comparable in both age groups. Administration of the control vaccine, Influvac Tetra, a subunit seasonal influenza vaccine devoid of NP, did not significantly increase the NP-specific immune responses in vaccinated subjects. The primary objective of the trial, namely the demonstration of superiority of the NP-specific IFNγ SFC response to OVX836 (at both dose levels) at Day 8 in the whole cohort, compared to Influvac Tetra, was thus achieved. The NP-specific immunity observed at baseline, the rapid rise of anti-NP IgG in the 18-49 years-old subjects already one week after a single dose of OVX836 and the polyfunctionality of CD4+ T-cells (IL-2+TNFα+IFNγ+) observed at baseline are consistent with a recall of pre-existing NP-specific immunity in the subjects, induced by preceding exposure to the influenza virus.Overall, OVX836 at 180µg performed better than OVX836 at 90µg, even though OVX836 vaccination at both dose levels was able to increase NP-specific responses. The dose-effect level was significant for the NP-specific IFNγ SFC response and for the frequency of CD4+ T-cells expressing IFNγ at Day 8. It was also observed in the older subgroup, in which only the 180µg dose was able to significantly increase the NP-specific SFC response and the CD4+ T-cells on Day 8.Flow cytometric analysis of T-cells induced after OVX836 vaccination showed that polyfunctional NP-specific CD4+ T-cells, co-expressing IFNγ, TNFα and IL-2, already present at lower level at baseline, increased significantly at Day 8 and even more at Day 29 after OVX836 vaccination, both in young and older subjects. Interestingly, this increase of polyfunctional CD4+ T-cells persisted until the end of the study period (Month 6), showing that the candidate vaccine induced/boosted NP-specific CD4+ T cells expressing functionally relevant anti-viral cytokines, i.e., IFNγ and TNFα. This is of importance, since polyfunctional cellular responses have been reported to be associated with protection against viral and bacterial infections (25–27).An increase of NP-specific CD8+ T-cells was not observed in the OVX836 vaccinated subjects. The intense circulation of influenza virus during the recruitment period of the study participants appears to have led to high baseline levels of NP-specific immunity, in particular of CD8+ T-cells. This may have jeopardized the detection of ensuing changes of signals. This assumption is supported by the fact that when the lowest quartile of CD8+ responders at baseline was analyzed separately, a significant CD8+ response could be observed on Day 8 for the OVX836 180µg dose level, which was not the case in the OVX836 90µg and Influvac Tetra groups. Another hypothesis could be that the vaccine antigen may not be effectively cross-presented to induce CD8+ T-cell responses against NP.OVX836 induced significant increases in anti-NP IgG, irrespective of the dose administered. Although not being neutralizing as NP is an internal antigen of the influenza virus, these antibodies may play a role in viral clearance by contributing to the elimination of infected cells (28), via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (29), immune complex natural killer cell priming (30) or other mechanisms (31).Both the CD4+ T-cell and the anti-NP IgG responses were persistent and remained significantly higher than baseline at Day 180. The IFNγ SFC response remained significantly higher than the baseline value 6 months after the immunization when excluding the subjects situated in the highest quartile who had probably been exposed to influenza before vaccination (Day 1). As already observed in Phase 1 study (19), the OVX836-induced T-cells peaked one week after vaccination and decreased afterwards while remaining above baseline at Day 180. The kinetics of the vaccine-induced NP-specific T-cell response is consistent with that observed after influenza infection and corresponds to the expansion and contraction phases described for T-cell responses (10, 32–34). The disappearance of T-cells from the blood compartment coincides with the postulated sequestration of some of these cells into functional memory cells localized in secondary organs or non-lymphoid organs. These cells are known to play a critical role in the fight against subsequent infections (35).The level and evolution over time of immune responses was similar for both age-groups (18-49 and 50-65 years old) for almost all immune parameters, with sustained immune responses for both age groups. However, the CD4 IFNγ+ and anti-NP IgG responses peaked later in the 50-65 years old group. Similarly, the 90µg dose-level, but not the 180µg dose-level, triggered a total T-cell response which peaked at Day 29 for subjects aged 50-65 years versus Day 8 for the younger age group. The consistency of this response pattern will be examined in future studies that will also include adults older than 65 years.Even though the study was not designed to show clinical efficacy, ILI follow-up during the influenza season allowed to make interesting observations. During the first 13 days after vaccination, no difference was observed in occurrences of ILIs between the three groups. This period likely coincides with the time the vaccines need to mount a protective immune response. Although the NP-specfic CD4+ response measured in the peripheral blood peaked at Day 8 in younger adults, it may take more time to reach a protective effector response in the respiratory tissues. In addition, ILI symptoms usually appear 1-4 days after exposure to the virus (incubation period). However, from 14 days post-vaccination onward until the end of flu season, fewer ILIs were observed in the OVX836 180µg and Influvac Tetra groups as compared to OVX836 90µg. It is tempting to consider these differences as a signal of vaccine effect but a large efficacy trial is needed to confirm this trend.We observed an association of pre-vaccination levels of IFNγ SFC and CD4+ T-cells (producing at least IFNγ) with a lowered risk for developing an ILI in the first few days after vaccination (i.e., before any vaccines were effective, three groups pooled together) in the whole vaccinated cohort. This corroborates the observations made earlier by Wilkinson et al. (32), correlating preexisting influenza-specific CD4+ with disease protection against influenza challenge in humans. This is also in line with the observations made by some of the authors, in a collaboration with the company hVivo, which pointed to the threshold of 100 SFC/106 PBMCs in the association with symptoms during the challenge study (36). Interestingly, only in the 180µg group did the levels of NP-specific IFNγ SFC triggered by OVX836 remain above the thresholds of 100 SFC/106 PBMCs (36) for more than 50% of the subjects, a threshold considered as predictive of an efficacy against PCR-confirmed symptomatic influenza in adults using the same assay as the one used in this study.Several vaccines aiming to induce T-cell responses against NP have been evaluated in clinical trials. FLU-V, a vaccine composed of an adjuvanted pool of peptides encoding for epitopes from NP and other influenza proteins successfully demonstrated efficacy in a challenge study (37) and a signal of efficacy in a field trial in the range of the signal described in this paper (38), but also cases of severe local inflammation likely attributable to the adjuvant. Other approaches targeting T-cell responses against NP using different technologies have failed to demonstrate efficacy in clinical trials (NCT03450915 and NCT03883113).The first limitation of this study is the fact that vaccination occurred during the influenza season, which had an impact on several immune parameters (e.g. CD8+ T-cells). A second limitation is the interference of the COVID-19 pandemic which prevented taking 20% of the Day 29 samples and performing PCRs after 17th March 2020, even though the primary endpoint was secured as all subjects were recruited before the COVID-19 epidemic peak. A third limitation is the fact that the study was not designed and powered to demonstrate efficacy, so that the efficacy signal observed cannot be conclusive.In conclusion, these results warrant further evaluation of the safety and immunogenicity of higher doses of OVX836 (300µg and 480µg in addition to 180µg) in order to select the best dose for a Phase 2b trial designed and powered to confirm the signal of efficacy on laboratory-confirmed flu cases.Data Availability StatementThe datasets presented in this article are not readily available because the dataset is confidential and proprietary to OSIVAX.

Successful Farming's Editorial Guidelines Published on April 3, 2022 Close Poultry flock owners should be on the lookout for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), an extremely infectious strain of an influenza type A virus that is often fatal to birds and can spread quickly between flocks. It can infect chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, domestic ducks and geese, guinea fowl, and wild birds, especially waterfowl. Begin with biosecurity While HPAI is mainly transmitted from wild birds to commercial flocks, it is likely spread in other ways as well. USDA recommends producers immediately implement biosecurity measures to minimize the chance of the virus entering their poultry houses. According to the USDA, producers need to carefully examine protocols surrounding personnel who enter poultry buildings, shared equipment and crews, disposal of dead birds, and manure management. It recommends implementing a line of separation for each building and a perimeter buffer area. If you suspect HPAI in your flock, call the USDA at 1-866-536-7593. Basic biosecurity measures include keeping visitors to a minimum, washing hands before and after coming in contact with birds, using disposable boot covers or disinfectant foot baths, changing clothes before entering and exiting poultry facilities, and cleaning and disinfecting tools and equipment before moving them to a new facility. Monitor and report Producers should regularly monitor their flocks for the warning signs of HPAI, including: Sudden increase in bird deathsSneezing, gasping, coughing, and nasal dischargeDiarrheaLack of energy and poor appetiteDrop in egg production or soft, thin-shelled, or misshapen eggsSwelling of the head, eyelids, comb, wattles, and hocksPurple discoloration of the wattles, comb, and legsStumbling or falling down If HPAI is suspected, producers should immediately report sick or unusual dead birds to a local or state veterinarian, the state animal health laboratory, or the USDA (call 1-866-536-7593). A federal or state animal health official will contact producers who file a report, and will arrange to come to the farm and take samples from live birds, dead birds, and the barn. Samples are taken to the nearest diagnostic laboratory, and initial results will be provided within 24 hours. Until the results are in, the operation is quarantined. Only authorized workers will be allowed in and out of facilities, and the movement of poultry and poultry products will be limited. 6 Tips to Mitigate the Spread of Avian Influenza USDA will also work with producers to inventory their poultry in order to appraise the flock and value depopulated birds. Producers with a biosecurity plan in place prior to detection may be eligible for indemnity payments to cover the loss of birds and cleanup. If HPAI is found If testing confirms avian influenza, the producer will be contacted by a veterinary medical officer, and USDA will provide caseworker assistance for going through the next steps, including depopulating the flock within 24 hours, working to determine how HPAI may have entered the facility, and checking with neighboring farms for possible spread. The caseworker will also help determine the best method for disposing of carcasses, depending on the size of the flock, local conditions, and laws and regulations. To clean affected buildings, all organic material will need to be removed. All items inside must be washed with detergent, rinsed, and allowed to dry. A disinfectant is then applied, and later surfaces are again rinsed and allowed to air dry. The building must remain empty for a minimum of 21 days, or until an APHIS official releases it from quarantine. Learn more at the USDA APHIS Defend the Flock Program website. Was this page helpful?

Michigan wildlife officials recently confirmed highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in the wild bird population and are developing safety protocols for wildlife rehabilitators who will be the among those most at risk.HPAI is a zoonotic pathogen which means it can transfer among animal species and even to humans. Recent HPAI detections don’t present an immediate public health concern, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and officials said “no human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected” in the U.S.Officials and volunteers at nonprofit organization Skegemog Raptor Center have recently cared for a number of wounded birds: a red-shouldered hawk hit by a vehicle, a bald eagle injured in a territorial fight with other eagles, and an American kestrel hurt when it got trapped in a building and flew into a window trying to escape. That is, until this week when a couple of terribly sick raptors arrived.Two bald eagles came into the Traverse City-based rehab center’s care on Monday, both showing signs of avian flu infection. The sickened raptors are being kept in quarantine away from the center’s other patients and resident education birds, while those caring for the sick eagles wear protective gear to keep themselves from contracting the disease and falling ill themselves.“The one bird unfortunately, I don’t think one of them is going to make it through the next 24 hours. She’s really down,” said James Manley, the center’s executive director.“It’s unfortunate. We’re doing the best we can to keep her comfortable and get her to turn around, but I have to get them pretty stable before we can test for that anyway.”HPAI causes severe illness and even sudden death in infected birds. Geese, ducks, and other waterfowl can carry the disease without showing symptoms, while raptors such as eagles and hawks tend to have a high mortality rate when infected by HPAI.State officials confirmed avian influenza in six Canada geese and two tundra swans collected last month at St. Clair Flats State Wildlife Area, along with two snowy owls from Macomb County and a mute swan from Monroe County. State agriculture officials previously confirmed the disease in backyard chicken flocks in Kalamazoo and Macomb counties.State authorities already have protocols for wildlife officials to safely collect wild birds suspected of having HPAI, but there are no standing recommendations for wildlife rehabbers. That’s in the works, said Megan Moriarty, state wildlife veterinary specialist.“What’s happening right now is we’re drafting guidance documents for wildlife rehabilitators because they’ll often be the first line of defense in an outbreak like this. And you know, they’re in a higher risk situation because they’ll be handling sick, wild birds, and so they’re higher risk than the general public,” she said.Veterinarian Victoria Hall, executive director at The Raptor Center at University of Minnesota recently offered advice to wildlife rehab facilities on how to handle operations during the ongoing avian influenza outbreak. She spoke during a recent webinar, and her organization additionally offers an “avian influenza 101″ informational website about the disease in wild and domestic birds.“If you continue to have birds coming in your facility when you have HPAI concerns in your area, you need to have an immediate isolation or euthanasia policy for suspect birds,” Hall said.“You need to know if you suspected that a bird might have it, what are you going to do? Where are you going to move them? Because the quicker you put that into place, the quicker you’ve removed the chance that there’s more shedding of the virus happening in your facility. So already thinking through that plan in your head and then testing.”The disease is spread through close contact and saliva, so Michigan residents are encouraged to temporarily remove bird feeders and baths to reduce the number of places where birds congregate. The disease also spreads through fecal droppings, so backyard chicken owners are encouraged to bring their birds indoors, if possible, or at least contain them inside an outdoor coop with a roof to protect from environmental exposure.Officials recommend contaminated surfaces be cleaned with soap and water, followed by a disinfectant like bleach.Related articles:RECOMMENDED•mlive.comPoachers exploit demand for eagle feathers, sacred among Native AmericansNov. 7, 2024, 9:00 a.m.Man who killed eagles on a Native American reservation gets nearly 4 years in prisonNov. 7, 2024, 9:00 a.m.DNR confirms deadly avian influenza in wild birds in 3 countiesDetroit Zoo moving birds indoors due to avian flu threat in MichiganHighly contagious bird flu found in Kalamazoo County flockIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

View all partners Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger An outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in chicken and turkey flocks has spread across 24 U.S. states since it was first detected in Indiana on Feb. 8, 2022. Better known as bird flu, avian influenza is a family of highly contagious viruses that are not harmful to wild birds that transmit it, but are deadly to domesticated birds. As of early April, the outbreak had caused the culling of some 23 million birds from Maine to Wyoming. Yuko Sato, an associate professor of veterinary medicine who works with poultry producers, explains why so many birds are getting sick and whether the outbreak threatens human health. Why is avian influenza so deadly for domesticated birds but not for wild birds that carry it? Avian influenza (AI) is a contagious virus that affects all birds. There are two groups of AI viruses that cause disease in chickens: highly pathogenic AI and low pathogenic AI. HPAI viruses cause high mortality in poultry, and occasionally in some wild birds. LPAI can cause mild to moderate disease in poultry, and usually little to no clinical signs of illness in wild birds. The primary natural hosts and reservoir of AI viruses are wild waterfowl, such as ducks and geese. This means that the virus is well adapted to them, and these birds do not typically get sick when they are infected with it. But when domesticated poultry, such as chickens and turkeys, come in direct or indirect contact with feces of infected wild birds, they become infected and start to show symptoms, such as depression, coughing and sneezing and sudden death. Live birds are banned at agricultural fairs during bird flu outbreaks to avoid spreading infections. These fake chickens were on display at the Cabarrus County, N.C. fair in 2015, a previous H5N1 outbreak year. Elizabeth W. Kearley via Getty Images There are multiple strains of avian influenza. What type is this outbreak, and is it dangerous to humans? The virus of concern in this outbreak is a Eurasian H5N1 HPAI virus that causes high mortality and severe clinical signs in domesticated poultry. Scientists who monitor wild bird flocks have also detected a reassortant virus that contains genes from both the Eurasian H5 and low pathogenic North American viruses. This happens when multiple strains of the virus circulating in the bird population exchange genes to create a new strain of the virus, much as new strains of COVID-19 like omicron and delta have emerged during the ongoing pandemic. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the risk to public health from this outbreak is low. No human illnesses have been associated with this virus in North America. That was also true of the last H5N1 outbreak in the U.S. in 2014 and 2015. Should people avoid poultry products until this outbreak ends? No, that’s not necessary. Infected poultry or eggs do not enter the food supply chain. To detect AI, the U.S. Department of Agriculture oversees routine testing of flocks done by farmers and carries out federal inspection programs to ensure that eggs and birds are safe and free of virus. When H5N1 is diagnosed on a farm or in a backyard flock, state and federal officials will quarantine the site and cull and dispose of all the birds in the infected flock. Then the site is decontaminated. After several weeks without new virus detections, the area is required to test negative in order to be deemed free of infection. We call this process the four D’s of outbreak control: diagnosis, depopulation, disposal and decontamination. Avian influenza is not transmissible by eating properly prepared and cooked poultry, so eggs and poultry are safe to eat. The USDA recommends cooking eggs and poultry to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 Celsius). Are avian influenza outbreaks happening more frequently around the world, or do we just hear more about them than we did 20 or 30 years ago? The dynamics of the spread of avian influenza viruses are very complex. HPAI is a transboundary disease, which means it is highly contagious and spreads rapidly across national borders. Some research indicates that detection of HPAI viruses in wild birds has become more common. Reports are seasonal, with a peak in February and a low point in September. There are ongoing outbreaks of HPAI in wild birds in Asia, Europe and Africa. Many migratory bird species travel thousands of miles between continents, posing a continuing risk of AI virus transmission. In addition, we have better diagnostic tests for much more rapid and improved detection of avian influenza compared to 20 to 30 years ago, using molecular diagnostics such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests – the same method labs use to detect COVID-19 infections. Farmers can take steps to make their flock more biosecure, such as preventing birds and their feed from being exposed to wild birds. What’s the prospect of developing a vaccine for poultry that could reduce the economic harm from outbreaks? Many factors would have to be weighed before adopting vaccination as a strategy for controlling HPAI. At this time, the Department of Agriculture has not approved the use of vaccination in the U.S. for protecting birds from avian influenza. One reason for this is that using vaccines would potentially affect international trade and poultry exports. Importers would not be able to distinguish vaccinated birds from infected birds based on the routine testing, so they might ban all U.S. poultry exports. Vaccination also could delay outbreak detection, since it can potentially hide non-apparent infections in infected birds. And if infections go unnoticed, they could spread to other farms before farmers can put control measures in place. Avian influenza vaccines can reduce clinical signs, sickness and death rates in domestic poultry, but they would not prevent birds from becoming infected with the virus. Ultimately, the USDA’s goal is to eradicate HPAI quickly after it is detected. However, vaccines could be used to help control an outbreak, and this is an option that the agency is investigating now.

GettyImages Chicken photo Parents and caregivers may have seen discussion of avian influenza (bird flu) through social media or news outlets. Zoos across the country are moving birds indoors to protect them. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say the risk to the public from current H5N1 bird flu viruses is low. There have been 118 outbreaks reported and more than 22 million birds have been affected since January, according to the CDC.So what does this all mean for children? Nicholas Rister, M.D., of the Cook Children's Infectious Disease team is here to break down what the bird flu is and share what parents and caregivers need to know.What is the avian flu and can people be infected by it?The influenza virus circulates around the world through a variety of human and animal hosts. Generally, the virus tends to stay within the same animal groups (ie, bird/avian flu infects birds and pig/swine flu infects pigs) but since the influenza virus is very good at mutating on a regular basis, it is able to jump from one type of animal to another from time-to-time. In particular, bird and pig influenza viruses are known to jump between each other and human hosts. When these jumps happen, the virus is often quite a bit different from the last time human hosts saw it, so our immune system may not be as well prepared (ie, worse infection, easier spread). The major four global influenza pandemics in the 20th century all occurred with an avian influenza jumping back to humans. But that is four pandemics in 100 years, so while we see lots of avian influenza viruses, they don’t all turn into pandemics. We also have flu vaccines made yearly that try to predict which viruses are most likely to emerge and provide so protection ahead of time.What should parents and caregivers know about the avian flu?Avian influenza in children presents like many respiratory viruses – fever, cough, congestion, fatigue, rash. In most cases, these symptoms will not become severe enough to require medical attention, but if a parent feels their child is having difficulty breathing or has altered mental status, they should certainly seek medical care. Very similar recommendations to many common illnesses. Additionally, the yearly influenza vaccine provides some protection each year against these infections. There are also anti-viral treatments (such as Tamiflu) available for patients that are found to have early infections with influenza to reduce the length of illness although many patients do not get ill enough to present for testing.Why are zoos removing birds from exhibits?This is out of an abundance of caution. Coming out of an era of COVID-19 pandemic planning, there is a lot of concern for any potential disease spread. The majority of documented cases of avian-swine-human influenza spread occurs at sites with consistent and prolonged interaction with animals. Think pig farms, outdoor butchers/food markers in developing nations, zoo workers. In all likelihood, no one was going to acquire a pandemic bird influenza from visiting a zoo exhibit but adjusting them may alleviate lots of concern with everyone on higher alert for respiratory viruses right now.Should I be concerned about feeding my child poultry and eggs?No. The virus spreads through close contact with the animals when they are alive or recently killed. Not from the food you would obtain at the store. However, be sure to cook and prepare all meat/poultry products appropriately since other concerns such as Salmonella always remain.Should I be concerned about my child interacting with birds, such as feeding the ducks or through bird feeders at home?Not in particular. While interacting with birds is how humans get avian flu, the conditions for transmission usually require a lot of persistent interaction as mentioned above. Routine interaction with ducks, small birds, outdoor feeders, is very unlikely to contribute much to the spread of avian flu.

Magellan penguins stand in their enclosure at the Blank Park Zoo on April 5 in Des Moines, Iowa, as zoos move their birds indoors to protect them from avian influenza. Charlie Neibergall/AP CNN — Zoos across the country are moving their birds indoors to protect them from the spread of a contagious and potentially lethal strain of the avian flu. Cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) have been rising in backyard flocks and wild birds across dozens of states in recent months, prompting zoo officials to temporarily shut down bird exhibits. “This strain of the disease is highly contagious and lethal to birds,” the Maryland Zoo in Baltimore said in a statement on its website. “As a precautionary measure, we have closed our aviaries and moved several of our bird species to behind-the-scenes facilities with limited human contact until the threat of avian influenza has subsided.” Raymond Boyd/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images Related article Detroit Zoo moves birds inside due to Avian Influenza concerns Birds in zoos could get infected by wild birds, humans or a new bird introduced to the facility. The avian flu was first detected in February in a commercial turkey flock in Dubois County, Indiana, according to the US Department of Agriculture. This was the first case of infection in the US since 2020. The disease caused by the flu has been detected in commercial and backyard flocks across 24 states and in wild birds across 31 states, according to the department. The Type A viruses naturally spread among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry along with bird and animal species, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They don’t usually affect humans, it said. The spread has led zoos in Pennsylvania, Colorado, Michigan, Wisconsin, Texas and Ohio in addition to Maryland to take preventative steps, including closing outdoor bird exhibits and moving the birds indoors for their safety. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) established the Zoo and Aquarium All Hazards Partnership program, which collaborates with zoos to create a plan before outbreaks occur. Preventative measures include putting up tarps or netting around the exhibits, closing walk-through aviaries to the public and implementing strong quarantine protocols, according to Rob Vernon, AZA’s senior vice president for communications and strategy. “Facilities are going to be in full response mode to protect their birds for at least the next couple of months until transmission decreases,” Vernon told CNN in a statement. A sign is seen at the Milwaukee County Zoo showing the bird exhibits are closed to protect against bird flu on April 5. Morry Gash/AP Zoos take precautionary measures In an effort to prevent infections, zoos have taken various steps to keep their birds safe. The Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium has barred the public from accessing birds including ostriches, chickens and owls. Visitors may see flamingos and penguins through the glass of their indoor habitats. In Colorado, the Denver Zoo moved its birds indoors for at least 28 days, it said in a statement. Dr. Ann Duncan, who heads animal health at Detroit Zoological Society, said moving birds indoors is a crucial preventive measure. “By bringing these animals indoors, we can more closely monitor them and prevent contact with wild birds who may be carriers of HPAI,” Duncan said in a February news release from the Detroit Zoo. The Maryland Zoo is adhering to a multi-tiered response plan reviewed by the USDA as well as other state departments, it said in a statement. Zoos across North America are moving their birds indoors and away from people and wildlife as they try to protect them from the highly contagious and potentially deadly avian influenza. Charlie Neibergall/AP The zoo, which has the largest colony of African penguins in North America, has not detected cases – but the case count is close enough to move its birds indoors, according to its senior communications director, Mike Evitts. “We are hatching penguin chicks as part of a plan to increase their numbers with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums breeding program as part of a global conservation effort,” he said. Prompted by an abundance of caution, the Milwaukee County Zoo’s Aviary and Humboldt Penguin exhibit has temporarily closed, according to its website. The Dallas Zoo also moved its birds away from public-facing enclosures “until the threat has passed,” saying animal health experts will continue to monitor and follow protocols as needed, the zoo said in a statement. Ohio’s Columbus Zoo also shuttered some bird habitats as they undergo monitoring and evaluation, according to its director of communication, Jen Fields.

Here we use a human lung alveolus chip that experiences cyclic breathing-like deformations to investigate whether physical forces influence innate immune responses to viral infection. Influenza H3N2 infection of mechanically active chips induces a cascade of host responses including increased lung permeability, apoptosis, cell regeneration, cytokines production, and recruitment of circulating immune cells. Comparison with static chips reveals that breathing motions suppress viral replication by activating protective innate immune responses in epithelial and endothelial cells, which are mediated in part through activation of the mechanosensitive ion channel TRPV4 and signaling via receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). RAGE inhibitors suppress cytokines induction, while TRPV4 inhibition attenuates both inflammation and viral burden, in infected chips with breathing motions. Therefore, TRPV4 and RAGE may serve as new targets for therapeutic intervention in patients infected with influenza and other potential pandemic viruses that cause life-threatening lung inflammation.

One reason is that it is difficult, if not impossible, to tease out the regulatory cues in the local environment within a living organ in vivo, and the mechanical cues encountered in the human lung are absent in conventional in vitro culture or organoid models.Breathing is central to life, but its biological effects in lung beyond oxygenation are poorly understood. Breathing motions in human lung exert dynamic physical forces on its constituent cells and tissues that promote lung branching1 and alveolar differentiation2 during normal lung development, and contribute to the etiology of various lung diseases, including acute lung injury3,4, pulmonary edema5, and pulmonary fibrosis6. Mechanical forces have been implicated in activation of neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages as well7. However, nothing is known about how breathing motions and mechanical forces impact innate immunity and responses to infection within lung parenchymal cells and pulmonary microvascular endothelium in an organ-relevant context. This is in large part because of the lack of experimental models that can mimic human lung structures and pathophysiology at the tissue and organ levels while permitting control over breathing motions.Influenza A viruses represent an ongoing threat to public health due to rapid mutation and reassortment of the viral genome. H3N2 strain is one of the predominant influenza strains in circulation and a leading cause of lower respiratory infection and hospitalization8. H3N2 infection in the lung alveolus damages the tissue barrier (alveolar-endothelial interface), induces pulmonary edema, recruits inflammatory cells, and if uncontrolled, causes severe viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), often leading to death9. Current studies of influenza infection in the distal lung rely on human cell lines that fail to recapitulate complex disease pathogenesis in vivo or mouse models that do not reflect the anatomy or pathophysiology of the natural human host.To overcome these limitations, human microphysiological systems, such as human organ-on-a-chip (Organ Chip) microfluidic devices have been developed that culture human cells in organ-specific three-dimensional environments to imitate the complex chemical, structural, and physical cues seen in vivo. The alveolus chip recapitulates the human alveolar-capillary interface with an air-liquid interface (ALI) and vascular fluid flow while allowing independent control over breathing motions4,5,10. Previously we showed that the alveolus chip can faithfully mimic human lung physiology, disease states, and adenoviral vector-mediated gene therapy delivery, as well as therapeutic efficacy and toxicity responses4,5,10,11,12. However, it is unknown if this model can accurately replicate human lung responses to influenza viral infection and explore the role of breathing motions during disease progression.Here we use an optimized human alveolus chip to model H3N2 influenza infection in vitro. We report that breathing motions suppress viral replication through a novel mechano-chemical control mechanism that involves the transient receptor potential vanilloid-type 4 (TRPV4) and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). Targeting these molecular mediators influences viral burden and host inflammation on-chip. Thus, human alveolus chip represents a clinically relevant platform for preclinical disease modeling and drug testing, thereby expediting therapeutic development against respiratory infections.ResultsRecapitulation of alveolar cell differentiation and alveolar-capillary interface formationThe human alveolus chip used in this study is a microfluidic device containing two parallel channels separated by an extracellular matrix (ECM)-coated porous membrane lined by primary human lung alveolar epithelium cells cultured under an ALI on its upper surface and primary human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells on the lower surface, which are fed by continuous flow of culture medium through the lumen of the lower vascular channel (Fig. 1a)10,12,13. The engineered alveolar-capillary interface is also exposed to cyclic mechanical deformations (5% cyclic strain at 0.25 Hz) to mimic physiological breathing motions at tidal volume14 and the normal respiratory rate of humans via application of cyclic suction to hollow side chambers within the flexible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) device (Fig. 1a).Fig. 1: The Human alveolus chip.a Schematic of human alveolus chip with primary alveolar epithelial type I (ATI) and type II (ATII) cells lining the upper surface of the porous ECM-coated membrane in the air channel with and pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC) on the lower surface of the same membrane in the basal vascular channel that is continuously perfused with medium. The entire membrane and adherent alveolar-capillary interface are exposed to physiological cyclic strain by applying cyclic suction to neighboring hollow chambers (gray) within the flexible PDMS microfluidic device. b Two magnifications of immunofluorescence micrographs showing the distribution of ZO1-containing tight junctions and ATII cell marker surfactant protein C (SPC) in the epithelium of the alveolus chip (bar, 50 μm). c Graph showing the percentages of ATI and ATII cells at the time of plating and 14 days after culture on-chip.

This is also accompanied by formation of a tight epithelial barrier (Supplementary Fig. 1c), which approximates that observed in vivo16. Confluent monolayers of interfaced alveolar epithelium and endothelium also display continuous cell-cell junctions stained apically with zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) in epithelium and laterally with vascular endothelial-cadherin (VE-cadherin), respectively, by 14 days of culture (Fig. 1d), which are maintained for at least 5 weeks on-chip.RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of the alveolar epithelium showed that epithelial cells cultured on-chip exhibit extensive changes in mRNA expression over 14 days in culture (Fig. 1e) and display distinct transcriptome changes compared to the same cells maintained in conventional static Transwell cultures, as demonstrated by principal component analysis (PCA) and differential gene expression analysis (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). Among the top differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are genes related to multicellular organismal homeostasis, respiratory tube development, and vasculature development, which is consistent with the establishment of epithelial-endothelial signaling crosstalk required for the maturation of the alveolar epithelium and the microvascular endothelium (Supplementary Fig. 2c and Supplementary Data 1 and 2) as we observed on-chip (Fig. 1).Using short time-series expression miner (STEM)17, we identified five gene expression patterns that exhibited statistically significant changes over time when cultured on-chip in the presence of breathing-like motions (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 3a). Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that many of the upregulated genes are involved in biological processes relevant to differentiation, including anatomical structure development, cell adhesion, movement of cell or subcellular components, and ECM organization (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Examples include aquaporin 5 (AQP5) and podoplanin (PDPN) (Supplementary Fig. 4a) that are known markers for ATI cells18, confirming the differentiation from ATII to ATI cells that we observed by immunostaining (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1b). Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and surfactant protein D (SFTPD), two genes involved in surfactant production, also increased (Supplementary Fig. 4a), consistent with the previous finding that mechanical strain promotes enhanced surfactant secretion in vivo19 and on-chip4. The downregulated pathways (profiles 0 and 4, Supplementary Fig. 3b) are associated with cell junctions and ECM organization, which include genes such as CLDN11 (claudin 11), CDH5 (cadherin 5), and PLAT (plasminogen activator) (Supplementary Fig. 3c).The upregulation of several ion channels and transporters (Supplementary Fig. 4b) suggests that alveolar fluid clearance, which is essential for maintenance of air-liquid interface, may be increased as well. Many genes belonging to defense responses also were upregulated from day 8 to 14 (Fig. 1f), including angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, which is also a key mediator of lung physiology and pathophysiology20. Other important innate immune response genes include myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1), 2′−5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), DExD/H-Box Helicase 58 (DDX58), signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), which we confirmed using qPCR (Fig. 1g) and immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1h). Importantly, this upregulation of genes related to alveolar development and defense response is also seen in human lung during the transition from fetus to birth (Supplementary Data 3)21,22.Significant genetic reprogramming was also observed in endothelial cells cultured in the presence of cyclic mechanical strain on-chip over 14 days in culture (Supplementary Fig. 5a, b). The Wnt signaling pathway is essential for cross-talk between endothelium and epithelium during lung development23 and consistent with this, we found a number of Wnt ligands, including WNT3, WNT7A, WNT7B, WNT9A, and WNT10A, exhibit elevated expression in endothelial cells on-chip in the presence of breathing motions (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Together, our analysis reveals that human lung alveolus chips that are exposed to physiological breathing motions recapitulate perinatal maturation of the alveolar-capillary interface, cell-ECM interactions, and epithelial-endothelial crosstalk that are indispensable for the development, homeostasis, and regeneration of the lung alveolus24.Influenza A virus infection of the human lung alveolus chipInfluenza A virus entry is mediated by hemagglutinin binding to sialic acid receptor on host cells, with avian and mammalian viral strains preferentially binding to α−2,3- or α−2,6-linked sialylated glycans, respectively25. Using glycan-specific lectins, we found that the human lung alveolar epithelial cells predominantly express α−2,3-linked sialic acid receptors on their apical surface on-chip (Fig. 2a). Consistent with this finding and results obtained in human lung tissues in vivo26, we found that influenza A/HongKong/8/68 (HK/68; H3N2) and A/HongKong/156/1997 (HK/97; H5N1) viruses successfully infect the epithelium in the human alveolus chip, whereas the influenza A/WSN/33 (WSN; H1N1) virus does not, as detected by immunostaining of viral nuclear protein (NP) (Fig. 2b). The specificity of this response is further exemplified by the finding that H1N1 virus that preferentially infects large airways also infects human Lung Airway Chips lined by bronchial epithelium much more effectively than H3N227.Fig. 2: Cellular phenotyping after influenza A virus infection of the human alveolus chip.a Top and side fluorescence views of the alveolar epithelium cultured on-chip and stained for α−2,3-linked sialic acid or α−2,6-linked sialic acid using Maackia Amurensis Lectin II (MAL II) and Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA), respectively (bar, 50 µm). b Top fluorescence views of the alveolar epithelium on-chip infected with three different influenza virus strains (WSN (H1N1), HK/68 (H3N2), or HK/97 (H5N1) at MOI = 1) and stained for viral nuclear protein (NP) in red and ZO-1 in white.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageConsistent with the observation that influenza A virus mainly target ATII cells in the human lung28, we found that H3N2 infection results in over 90% reduction of the surfactant gene expression (Fig. 2c). This is also consistent with recent observation that SARS-CoV-2 infection in the alveolus leads to suppression of the ATII program29. Loss of ATII cells caused by H3N2 infection leads to increased lung permeability (Fig. 2d) as well as a 25% increase in apoptotic cells as indicated by Apopxin Green staining (Fig. 2e, f), while no necrosis was observed at 48 h after infection. The absence of necrosis-mediated cell death by H3N2 infection on-chip is consistent with reports from human biopsies indicating that this type of cell death is associated with more severe human and avian infections caused by H5N1 and H9N2 strains30. We also observed a significant increase in cell proliferation by quantifying Ki67 staining (Fig. 2e, g), indicating the initiation of a repair program similar to that observed in vivo31. Similar injury and repair responses are also observed in the endothelial cells (Fig. 2e–g), supporting recent evidence that lung endothelium possesses substantial regenerative capacity after viral pneumonia32. In summary, our alveolus chip replicates both the viral and cellular tropisms and cellular phenotypical alterations that are known to be produced by influenza infection in the human distal lung, including loss of barrier, cell death, and regeneration.Multi-level host responses to infection in the human lung alveolus chipAs cytokine production by lung epithelial and endothelial cells is a key feature of early host innate immune response to viral infections, we analyzed cytokines that are secreted into the basal vascular outflow using Luminex assays, analogous to measurement of plasma cytokine levels in vivo. These studies revealed that infection with influenza H3N2 virus induces significantly higher levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-8, interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in the vascular outflows at 48 h post infection (hpi) compared to control uninfected chips (Fig. 3a). RNA-seq of the epithelial cells carried out at the same time point (48 hpi) revealed 496 upregulated genes and 538 downregulated genes (Fig. 3b). GO analysis indicated that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) belong to biological pathways including cell division and DNA replication that may be associated with antiviral defense responses and activation of alveolar barrier repair in response to virus-induced injury (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 6a), which is consistent with the observation of increased Ki67+ proliferative cells (Fig. 2f). Some of these DEGs, such as CXCL10 (C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 10, encodes IP-10) and IL6, were further confirmed by qPCR (Supplementary Fig. 6b).Fig. 3: Systematic inflammation after influenza A virus infection of the human alveolus chip.a Concentrations of the indicated cytokines at day 17 measured by Luminex assay in the effluent of the vascular channels of alveolus chips infected with HK/68 (H3N2) virus (MOI = 1) versus control untreated chips (Ctrl) at 48 hpi in the presence of 5% strain.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageA more detailed analysis of antiviral responses induced in the lung epithelium in the alveolus chip revealed a dominant type III interferon (IFN-III) response mediated by interferon lambda (IFNλ) (Supplementary Fig. 6c). Importantly, this finding differs from results obtained from analysis of human lung alveolar epithelial cells cultured in static 2D culture on rigid planar dishes where IFNβ-mediated type I interferon response prevails33. However, our results replicate in vivo findings34, which suggest that IFN-III mediates the front-line response to viral infection in mucosal tissues35. In contrast to the epithelium (Fig. 3b), a more limited effect on the host transcriptome was observed in the endothelium (Fig. 3d). But enrichment analysis shows that genes involved in activation of immune responses and ion transport are also upregulated in these cells (Fig. 3e). Interestingly, however, this is likely through tissue-tissue signaling crosstalk as viral mRNA could not be detected within the endothelium.Influenza virus infection also upregulates expression of endothelial adhesion molecules, thereby allowing the recruitment of leukocytes to the alveolus in vivo9. When fluorescently labeled primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were flowed through the endothelium-lined vascular channel 24 hpi with influenza H3N2, we detected upregulation of ICAM1 and TNF in the endothelial cells by qPCR, indicating endothelial inflammation (Supplementary Fig. 6d). Indeed, this resulted in more than a 100-fold increase in the adhesion of the circulating PBMCs to the surface of the activated endothelium compared to control uninfected chips (Fig. 3f, g and Supplementary Fig. 6e). To determine which immune cell types are recruited, we isolated human CD14+ monocytes, CD3+ T cells, and CD19+ B cells, labeled each population with a different fluorescent cell tracker, mix them at a ratio of 6:3:1 (monocytes: T cells: B cells), and perfused the mixture through the vascular channel of the chip 24 h after infection (Supplementary Fig. 6f). Two hours after perfusion under static conditions, we found that all of the cell types were able to adhere to the endothelium or transmigrate up into the epithelium (Supplementary Fig. 6g and Fig. 3h). Interestingly, a higher percentage of B cells remained in the endothelium than T cells, which is in agreement with the timing of T cell activation preceding that of B cells. In addition, the recruitment of immune cells further increased the levels of cytokines, such as IL-8, IL-18, and S100 Calcium Binding Protein A8 and A9 (S100A8/9; also named as Calprotectin) (Supplementary Fig. 6h), consistent with our previous findings from the human Airway Chip36. Thus, the human breathing alveolus chip faithfully replicates multi-level host innate immune responses of lung alveoli to influenza A virus infection.Breathing-like mechanical deformations suppress viral infection on-chipWe next explored the role of cyclic respiratory motions in virus-induced respiratory infections by infecting alveolus chips with H3N2 virus on day 15 of culture and measuring viral loads in the presence or absence of physiological, breathing-like, mechanical deformations (5% strain, 0.25 Hz). Immunostaining for influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) revealed significant suppression of viral infection in lung alveolar epithelial cells exposed to breathing motions 2 days following the introduction of virus on-chip compared to static chip controls (Fig. 4a). This inhibition by mechanical stimulation was further confirmed using qPCR and a plaque assay, which respectively show that the application of cyclic mechanical strain leads to a 50% reduction of viral mRNA in the epithelium (Fig. 4b) and ~80% reduction of viral titers in apical washes compared to static controls (Fig. 4c). This also was accompanied by a reduction in the production of the inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand or Apo 2 ligand), and IP-10, as measured in the vascular outflows from the chips (Fig. 4d). Moreover, similar inhibition of viral infection by cyclic mechanical strain was observed when the alveolus chips were infected with other respiratory viruses, including H5N1 influenza virus (Supplementary Fig. 7a) and the common cold OC43 coronavirus (Supplementary Fig. 7b).Fig. 4: Cyclic mechanical strain inhibits viral infection in alveolus chip.a Immunostaining of influenza virus NP (red) in alveolus chips that are cultured under static conditions (Static) or under 5% and 0.25 Hz cyclic mechanical strains (Strain) for 48 h and then infected with HK/68 (H3N2) (MOI = 1) for another 48 h (blue, DAPI-stained nuclei; scale bar, 50 µm). b Graph showing fold changes in RNA levels of influenza virus NP in the epithelium within alveolus chips from a as measured by qPCR.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageMechanical strain increases innate immunity in Lung ChipsTo gain insight into how mechanical strain associated with physiological breathing motions might normally act to combat viral infection, we analyzed the RNA-seq analysis time course and noticed that exposure to continuous cyclic mechanical deformations resulted in increased expression of multiple IFN-related antiviral genes, including DDX58, MX1, OAS1, and STAT1, in both lung epithelial and endothelial cells from day 8 to day 14 of culture (Fig. 1f, g and Supplementary Fig. 5b). Indeed, many interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) have higher expression in mechanically stimulated cells at day 14 on-chip but not in cells cultured in parallel in static Transwells (Supplementary Fig. 8a), and this was confirmed by qPCR analysis which showed increased expression of type I and type III interferons (Supplementary Fig. 8b).To directly determine whether mechanical strain influences innate immunity pathway signaling, we cultured the alveolus chips in the presence or absence of cyclic mechanical strain from day 10 to 14 and performed RNA-seq analysis. Consistent with our earlier results, lung alveolar epithelial cells mechanically stimulated on-chip exhibit higher expression of ISGs and cytokines, such as MX1, MX2, IL6, CXCL10, CXCL5 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 5), IFI44L (interferon induced protein 44 like), and IFIH1 (interferon induced with helicase C domain 1), compared to static chip controls (Fig. 5a). Functional enrichment analysis of DEGs demonstrated that application of physiological cyclic strain activates pathways related to host defense response, while suppressing processes related to cell cycle and cell proliferation (Fig. 5b).Fig. 5: Mechanical strain reversibly regulates innate immune response in alveolus chip in uninfected chips.a Volcano plot of DEGs comparing epithelial cells from alveolus chips under static or 5% strain culture condition for 4 days.

P values were adjusted using Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons in a–d, f, and g.Full size imageTo further investigate the association between mechanical strain and innate immunity, we switched a subset of chips that had been exposed to 5% cyclic mechanical strain from day 10 to 14 to static conditions or to elevated mechanical strain (10%) condition on day 15 while continuing to mechanically stimulate the remaining chips at 5% for 2 additional days. The choice of 10% strain is based on our calculation37,38,39 (Supplementary Data 4) that both low-tidal volume (6 ml/kg) and high-tidal volume ventilation (12 ml/kg) can lead to ~10% mechanical strain in the alveolus, which is often seen in patients with emphysema or lung edema due to increased lung compliance or surface tension40. RNA-seq analysis of the epithelial cells on day 17 revealed that cessation of mechanical stimulation results in suppression of the innate immune response, exemplified by decreased expression of antiviral genes, such as IFIT1 (interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1), IFIT2, OASL (2′−5′-Oligoadenylate Synthetase Like), and DDX58 (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 8c). On the other hand, elevating the level of mechanical stimulation to 10% strain results in modest upregulation of innate immune response genes (Fig. 5d, e and Supplementary Fig. 8d). In parallel, similar reduction in innate immune response pathway signaling is observed in endothelial cells when mechanical stimulation ceases (Fig. 5f and Supplementary Fig. 8e). However, increasing mechanical strain to 10% results in further upregulation of innate immune response genes (Fig. 5g, h and Supplementary Fig. 8f), including several inflammatory cytokines, such as CXCL3 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 3), CCL20 (C-C motif chemokine ligand 20), IL1A (interleukin-1 alpha), CXCL1 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1), and CXCL5 (Fig. 5h). These results suggest that endothelial cells may be more sensitive to elevated mechanical strains than the epithelial cells. Together, these results demonstrate that cyclic mechanical forces similar to those experienced during breathing in the lung sustain higher levels of antiviral innate immunity in both lung alveolar epithelial cells and pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells compared cells cultured in the same chips under static conditions, which helps to explain why viral infection efficiency is reduced in the mechanically strained alveolus chips.S100A7 mediates the effects of mechanical strain on lung innate immunityWe then leveraged this Organ Chip approach to explore the underlying mechanism responsible for these effects by examining our RNA-seq data sets. This analysis revealed that the S100 calcium-binding protein A7 (S100A7), which encodes a member of the S100 family of alarmins proteins and a ligand for RAGE, as one of the top genes differentially expressed in response to cyclic strain application in all experiments (Figs. 1f and 5a, c, e, and Supplementary Fig. 9a), and one that was not induced cells in static culture on-chip or in Transwells (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 9a). Chips cultured under physiological 5% strain from day 10 to 14 exhibit significantly higher mRNA levels of S100A7 in both epithelium and endothelium than when the cells were cultured under static conditions (Fig. 6b). This increase in S100A7 gene expression in response to mechanical stimulation is also associated with a significant increase in S100A7 protein secretion, as determined by quantifying its levels in apical washes from human alveolus chips using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Fig. 6c). Moreover, over-expression of S100A7 induces significant upregulation of the antiviral cytokines IFNβ1 and IFNλ1 in lung alveolar epithelial cells on-chip (Fig. 5d) as well as in conventional monoculture (Supplementary Fig. 9b) and in A549 lung cells, which similarly show both overexpression of S100A7 and reduced influenza H1N1 virus infection in a RAGE-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. 9c, d). To directly examine the effect of S100A7 on gene transcriptional network, we performed RNA-seq analysis of alveolar epithelial cells on-chip after transfection of a plasmid expressing human S100A7. Differential gene expression analysis revealed that increased expression of S100A7 indeed upregulates many genes involved in the innate immune response, including IFNL1, CCL5 (C-C motif chemokine ligand 5), IFI6 (Interferon alpha-inducible protein 6), and IL6 (Fig. 6e, f). Therefore, S100A7 that is induced by breathing motions is able to drive the host innate immune response.Fig. 6: Mechanical strain-induced S100A7 increases innate immunity.a Graph showing the levels of S100A7 mRNA (transcripts per million) in the epithelial cells of alveolus chips at different time points of culture, measured by RNA-seq.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageThe mechanosensitive ion channel TRPV4 is upstream of S100A7Cells can sense mechanical stimuli through diverse mechanosensitive molecules at the cell surface, including integrins, G protein coupled-receptors, growth factor receptors, and mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs)41. The most rapid responses are mediated by MSCs that generate an ion flux in response to membrane deformation, and thereby regulate a wide variety of cellular processes, including innate immunity42. Mechanical strain has been reported to increase intracellular Ca2+ in lung alveolar epithelial cells and endothelial cells43, and pharmacological or genetic modulation of calcium flux through the mechanosensitive TRPV4 ion channel was found to regulate pulmonary barrier function in the lung alveolus chip5,12. Indeed, RNA-seq analysis confirmed that both cell types cultured in the lung alveolus chip express high level of TRPV4 as well as other MSCs, such as piezo type mechanosensitive ion channel component 1 (PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 (Supplementary Fig. 10). Importantly, when we perfused the TRPV4 inhibitor, GSK2193874, through the vascular channel of the alveolus chip while exposing the alveolar-capillary interface to 10% mechanical strain at 0.25 Hz for 48 h, the upregulation of S100A7 and CXCL10 was suppressed as measured by PCR in both epithelial cells (Fig. 6g) and endothelial cells (Fig. 6h), and this was accompanied by a reduction in the levels the inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, GM-CSF, and MCP-1 (Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) in the vascular effluent (Fig. 6i).To determine whether RAGE and TRPV4 mediate the effects of mechanical strain on innate immunity, we perfused the RAGE inhibitor azeliragon or the TRPV4 inhibitor GSK2193874 at non-toxic doses (Supplementary Fig. 11) through the vascular channel of the alveolus chip for 48 hours before infection with H3N2 while applying 5% mechanical strain (Fig. 7a). These studies confirmed that prophylactic inhibition of RAGE by pretreating the chips with either 20 or 100 nM azeliragon prevented the increase in cytokine production (Fig. 7b), although we observed that treatment with the higher dose resulted in a higher viral load (viral NP mRNA levels) when analyzed 48 h following infection (Fig. 7c). Interestingly, while pretreatment with the TRPV4 inhibitor also reduced cytokines, it decreased viral mRNA levels (Fig. 7b,c). This difference in viral load response suggests that TRPV4 is likely acting in multiple signaling pathways in parallel, and at least one other contributes to host response to viral infection via a distinct mechanism. In fact, prior work has shown that TRPV4 can influence viral infection by inducing nuclear translocation of DEAD-Box Helicase 3 X-Linked (DDX3X), a protein that promotes nuclear viral export and translation44. Taken together, these results confirm that TRPV4 is one of the players that mediate the mechanotransduction process by which mechanical strain applied to the lung alveolar epithelium and endothelium results in activation of S100A7/RAGE pathway, and thereby drives an innate immune response.Fig. 7: RAGE mediates mechanical strain-induced activation of innate immunity during infection.a Illustration of the experimental protocol involving prophylactic treatment with signaling inhibitors for 48 h prior to viral infection of the human alveolus chip. b Graphs showing cytokine levels on chips. c Graph showing mRNA levels of H3N2 NP in epithelial cells treated with azeliragon or GSK2193874 at indicated doses on-chip.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageRAGE inhibitors suppress viral infection-induced inflammatory responsesInterestingly, S100A7 gene expression and protein secretion are also upregulated in both epithelial cells and endothelial cells in response to infection of the alveolus chips with H3N2 influenza virus, and this is accompanied by upregulation of other S100 family members, including S100A8, S100A9, and S100A12 (Figs. 3b, d and 8a), which could further augment inflammation. As S100A7 and other members of the S100 family signal through RAGE45, we next explored whether RAGE inhibitors can be used to suppress host inflammatory responses during viral infection in alveolus chips when administered the drugs in a therapeutic mode (2 hours after infection). One advantage of human Organ Chips is that they permit drug testing in a more clinically relevant pharmacological setting by enabling clinically relevant doses of drugs (e.g., maximum blood concentration or Cmax) to be perfused through the vascular channel under flow as occurs in the vasculature of living organs46 (Fig. 8b). When azeliragon, a RAGE inhibitor that demonstrated safety but not efficacy in Phase III clinical trials involving more than 2000 patients with Alzheimer Disease and diabetic nephropathy, was perfused at its Cmax at 100 nM47 through the vascular channel of human alveolus chips infected with H3N2 influenza virus while exposed to cyclic physiological (5%) strain, it significantly blocked induction of multiple cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8, IP-10 and RANTES (Fig. 8c), and similar effects are produced using a different RAGE inhibitor drug (FPS-ZM1) (Supplementary Fig. 12a). Interestingly, treatment with 100 nM azeliragon had no effect on viral load under these conditions (Fig. 8d), which is in contrast to when it was administered prophylactically (Fig. 7c). When we combined azeliragon with the potent ribonucleoside analog, molnupiravir, which demonstrates broad-spectrum antiviral activity against various RNA viruses, including influenza A (Fig. 8e), SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and Ebola48,49, we found that the combination produced synergistic inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production following H3N2 infection (Fig. 8f and Supplementary Fig. 12b), whereas there was no added effect on viral infection (Fig. 8d and Supplementary Fig. 12c). Taken together, these data support the therapeutic potential for RAGE inhibitors, such as azeliragon, as suppressors of host-damaging inflammatory responses to viral infection when used alone or in combination with direct antiviral drugs.Fig. 8: RAGE inhibitor azeliragon suppresses viral host inflammation responses and produces synergistic effects with molnupiravir when administered 2 h after infection.a Graph showing the protein levels of S100A7 (left) and S100A8/A9 (right) in the vascular effluents of the alveolus chips at 48 hpi with HK/68 (H3N2) virus (MOI = 1) in the presence of 5% strain.

Exposure to cyclic mechanical cues associated with physiological breathing motions (5% strain; 15 deformations/min) sustains moderate levels of production and secretion of S100A7 protein by alveolar epithelium and endothelium, which binds to RAGE and generates an innate immune response that protects against viral infection, whereas S100A7 levels are lower and viral infection greater when breathing motions are absent. Our data also show that pharmacological inhibitors of RAGE signaling suppress inflammation during influenza infection, raising the possibility that RAGE inhibitors might represent novel adjuvants that may be used alone or in combination with antiviral therapies to suppress life-threatening inflammation of the distal airway that can be triggered by influenza A viruses. Importantly, they might also be useful for suppressing augmented inflammatory responses associated with conditions, such as COVID-19, which result in abnormally high levels of S100 family protein production50,51.Lung alveoli are exposed to dynamic mechanical stresses with each breath and these physical deformations are known to influence lung development2,52,53, surfactant production53,54, and tissue barrier integrity4. Mechanical forces also have been suggested to activate immune cells in lung55, particularly in response to pathological stresses associated with hypeventilation7,56. But little is known about the effects of breathing-associated cyclic mechanical strain on host innate immunity in response to viral infections within the tissue parenchyma. Our study provides the first evidence indicating that physical forces control innate immunity in nonimmune cells and tissues, specifically in pulmonary alveolar epithelium and microvascular endothelium. This is important for the lung as it is exposed to numerous airborne antigens during early life while the adaptive immune system is still immature57. These findings are also supported by recent single-cell RNA-seq studies of lung alveolar epithelium, which demonstrate increased innate immunity at birth in both mouse and human21,22. In addition, our finding that a hyper-physiological deforming stress (10% strain) leads to an augmented host inflammatory response, especially in the endothelial cells, resonates with clinical findings, which show that low tidal volume ventilation that induces less cyclic mechanical strain results in lower plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines than use of a normal tidal volume strategy58,59; importantly, this greatly benefits patients with ARDS60. Because human alveolus chips can be used to study the effects of applying strain deformations at different amplitudes and frequencies, they could potentially be used in the future to probe the relationship between these parameters and lung innate immunity, and thereby help to provide design criteria to optimize therapeutic strategies to mitigate ventilator-associated lung injury.This work led to the discovery that production of S100A7 protein and its binding to RAGE mediate the mechanical induction of innate immunity we observed in the alveolus chips. S100A7 also has been shown to exhibit antibacterial and antifungal activities61,62. A role for S100A7 in antiviral host responses has not been reported previously; however, it attracted our interest because it has been shown to exert immunomodulatory effects by binding to the inflammation associated RAGE63,64. Importantly, RAGE deficiency increases sensitivity to viral infection in animal models65, and the closely related S100A8 and S100A9 proteins have been shown to induce innate immune programming and protect newborn infants from sepsis66. However, while these S100 proteins help to resolve infections, they can cause severe inflammation and tissue damage when they are aberrantly expressed67. For example, S100A8, S100A9, and S100A12 levels in blood have recently been shown to correlate with disease severity in COVID-19 patients infected with SARS-CoV-250,51. S100A7 has been previously shown to exerts its immunomodulatory functions via RAGE-dependent activation of MAPK and NFκB signaling pathways64. Interestingly, RAGE is more highly expressed in lung ATI cells at baseline than any other cell type, many of which show little to no RAGE expression68, and it appears to play a major role in pulmonary inflammation in various diseases, including COVID-1968,69. Our finding that S100A7 expression is controlled mechanically in lung alveoli is also consistent with the observation that it is also induced by mechanical stress in human dental pulp cells70. Activation of the S100A7-RAGE pathway may be essential for development of host innate immunity in newborns as well since high amounts of the perinatal alarmins S100A8 and S100A9 have been reported to induce innate immune programming and protect newborn infants from sepsis66. While our results demonstrate that S100A7 is sufficient to induce interferon-mediated innate immunity, it is likely not sufficient to explain other effects of mechanical deformation, since both innate immunity and the RAGE pathway may be activated in other ways (e.g., there are many types of stimulatory and inhibitory RAGE ligands). These mechanisms warrant further investigation.We also found that inhibition of TRPV4 suppresses the induction of S100A7 and downstream innate immune response pathways driven by mechanical strain in lung alveolar and endothelial cells. This is intriguing because TRPV4 also appears to play a similar role in regulate innate responses within immune cells in the lung7,55,56. In contrast to inhibition of RAGE, pretreatment of the alveolus chips with a TRPV4 inhibitor decreased viral load despite decreased cytokines as predicted, which is likely due to a separate and more direct effect of TRPV4 signaling on the DDX3X protein, which directly influences virus import into the nucleus and subsequent translation44. Therefore, the ultimate effect of TRPV4 inhibition on viral load will depend on relative balance between these opposing activities; however, DDX3X signaling appears to dominate under our experimental conditions. Future research using iPS cell-derived alveolar epithelial cells that are deficient in these genes may offer a better solution to tease out the mechanistic details. Nevertheless, our data suggest that TRPV4 inhibitors may represent an attractive therapy for viral pneumonia as they may both suppress viral load via DDX3X signaling and dampen the associated inflammatory response via the S100A7/RAGE pathway.Finally, we demonstrated that influenza virus infection also induces the expression of S100A7, S100A8, S100A9, and S100A12 in the alveolus chip, a finding that is consistent with recent clinical observations from COVID-19 patients that exhibit late stage lung infections with SARS-CoV-2 virus29,50,51,71,72,73. While the innate immune response mediated by the S100 alarmins may be beneficial in combating against initial infection, sustained expression and dysregulation of alarmins can result in hyperinflammatory responses that cause irreversible tissue damage, as encountered by patients with severe diseases that require mechanical ventilation74. Importantly, using a clinical-relevant dosing strategy in the alveolus chips (i.e., by perfusing them with drugs at their clinical Cmax), we found that administration of RAGE inhibitor drugs, such as azeliragon and FPS-ZM1, inhibit viral-induced secretion of inflammatory cytokines when used alone and these effects are amplified when azeliragon is administered therapeutically (2 hours after infection) in combination with the antiviral drug molnupiravir. As azeliragon was found to be well tolerated in phase III trials, it represents an attractive treatment option for attenuating aberrant host immune responses due to viral infection and/or mechanical ventilation in patients with pneumonia or ARDS. But the timing of dosing should be examined with caution because inhibiting RAGE activity during early stage of lung infections may shut off host anti-viral responses and lead to prolonged viral clearance, as suggested by our prophylactic treatment with high dose azeliragon (Fig. 7c). However, it is important to note that a recent study showed that treatment of mice infected with SARS-CoV-2 with the RAGE inhibitor (FPS-ZM1) that we showed suppresses cytokine production in response to influenza virus infection, significantly increased animal survival and limited disease pathogenesis whether administered before or after viral infection75. Thus, RAGE inhibition can be a clinically relevant therapeutic target in viral pneumonia and RAGE inhibitor drugs can be used safely in the context of infection with a respiratory virus. Nevertheless, future research will also need to be carried out to define the optimal therapeutic window for use of RAGE and TRPV4 inhibitors in patients with viral infection.Our study also has multiple limitations. First, as an in vitro model, the human alveolus chip cannot replace animal infection models to evaluate the impact of new therapies on IAV-induced weight-loss or mortality; however, the cellular and molecular features underlying these global manifestations are easily probed using our model, such as barrier loss, cell apoptosis, and activation of innate and adaptive immune responses. Second, the current model does not include alveolar macrophages, which also can contribute significantly to antiviral immune responses. But due to the modular feature of the alveolus chip, primary alveolar or monocyte-derived macrophages can be integrated into the epithelial channel of the chip, as recently demonstrated in a murine lung-on-chip model76. This approach could be used, for example, to determine how cyclic mechanical deformations affect macrophage activation and other inflammatory activities in the future. Additionally, because the air channel is accessible to the incubator with a 20% oxygen concentration and PDMS is permeable to air, the oxygen concentration remains constant under all experimental settings. As a result, our current model precludes exploration of the effect of oxygen concentration on innate immunity and viral infection. Also, as we only model transverse deformations of the cells and tissues in parallel to the alveolar-capillary interface in our chip, and the PDMS membrane is significantly stiffer than the tissues, we cannot easily study effects of surfactant-related changes in surface tension or ventilation-related transepithelial pressure changes and anisotropic stains in the current model77. It also should be noted that in our studies using alveolus chips lined by epithelial cells from different human donors, we found that azeliragon did not block all cytokines to the same level in every donor (e.g., RANTES effects in Fig. 8f versus 8c); however, the overall trend of inducing suppression of inflammatory cytokines was consistent across multiple donors.As demonstrated by the current COVID-19 pandemic, potential pandemic viruses, including influenza A viruses, pose a major threat to public health. The lack of experimental models of the distal lung has greatly handicapped our efforts to repurpose existing drugs, understand disease pathology, and develop new therapies. Using influenza A virus as an example, we extend past work focused on viral infection of large airway27 by demonstrating that the alveolus chip recapitulates viral receptor expression, strain-dependent infectivity, and system-level host responses in the alveolar epithelial, endothelial, and immune cells during infection by viruses that target alveoli. These features have been overlooked in previous influenza research using cell lines or animal models, but are indispensable for better understanding of disease pathogenesis and identification of more predictive biomarkers and effective therapeutic targets. Thus, in addition to serving as a model system for gaining greater insight into mechanochemical mechanisms that underlie this form of innate immunity, it might serve as a useful preclinical model for identification and optimization of new and more effective antiviral therapeutics for diseases of the distal airway that lead to alveolitis and ARDS. In this context, it is interesting to note that data from this manuscript were recently included in an Investigation New Drug (IND) application to the FDA requesting entry of azeliragon into human clinical trials for treatment of viral pneumonia in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.MethodsAlveolus chip cultureMicrofluidic two-channel Organ Chip devices and automated ZOE instruments used to culture them were purchased from Emulate Inc (Boston, MA, USA). After chip activation using ER1/ER2 reagents following manufacturer’s instruction, both channels were seeded with 200 µg/ml Collagen IV (5022-5MG, Advanced Biomatrix) and 15 µg/ml of laminin (L4544-100 UL, Sigma) at 37 °C overnight. The next day (day 1), primary human lung microvascular endothelial cells (Lonza, CC-2527; obtained at P3 and expanded according to manufacturer’s instruction to P5 before use) and primary human lung alveolar epithelial cells (Cell Biologics, P1, H-6053, Lot # F101517Y72; used after thawing without further expansion) were sequentially seeded in the bottom and top channels of the chip at a density of 8 × 106 and 1.6 × 106 cells/ml, respectively, under static conditions. On day 2, the chips were inserted into Pods (Emulate Inc.), placed within the ZOE instrument, and the apical and basal channels were respectively perfused (60 µL/h) with epithelial growth medium (Cell Biologics, H6621) and endothelial growth medium (Lonza, CC-3202). On day 5, 1 µM dexamethasone was added to the apical medium to enhance barrier function. On day 7, an air-liquid interface (ALI) was established in the epithelial channel by flowing at 1000 μL/h for 5 min until all medium from this channel was emptied. Chips were fed through the lower vascular channel, and this medium was changed to EGM-2MV with 0.5% FBS on day 9. Two days later, the ZOE instrument was used to apply cyclic (0.25 Hz) 5% mechanical strain to the engineered alveolar-capillary interface to mimic lung breathing on-chip. Chips were used for experiments on Day 15. In experiments included in Figs. 2c–g, 3h, and 8d, e, the alveolar epithelial cells were isolated from an alternative donor source as previously described78. The donor tissue was obtained from the International Institute for the Advancement of Medicine (IIAM) and used in accordance with the regulations by IIAM. All uses of human material have been approved by the Harvard Longwood Campus Institutional Review Board.Viral stocksInfluenza virus strains used in this study include A/WSN/33 (H1N1), A/Hong Kong/8/68/ (H3N2), and A/Hong Kong/156/1997 (H5N1). All viruses were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or kindly shared by Drs. P. Palese, R.A.M. Fouchier, and A. Carcia-Sastre. Influenza virus strains were expanded in MDCK.2 cell79. OC43 coronavirus (VR-1558) was obtained from the ATCC and expanded in HCT-8 cells (ATCC, #HRT-18) as previously described80.Viral infection on chipChips and pods were removed from ZOE and put in biosafety cabinet (BSC). Chips were disconnected from pods and 40 µl viral inoculate was added to the top channel inlet to infect alveolar epithelial cells. Then chips were put back to pods and kept in static condition at 37 °C. Two hours later, chips were removed from pods and top channels were washed with 100 µl DPBS (−/−). Chips were reprimed, connected to pods and continued for flow at 60 µL/h and 5% mechanical strain.RNA extraction from Chip for RNA-seqFor RNA extraction, chips were removed from pods. An empty 200 µL filtered tip was inserted to top channel outlet and washed with 100 µL DPBS (+/+) into the top channel inlet to wash the apical channel. After collecting top channel washes, a new empty 200 µL filtered tip was inserted to top channel outlet and 100 µl RNase easy lysis buffer (Qiagen, #74034) was used to lyse epithelial cells by quickly pressing and releasing the micropipette plunger three times. Lysates were collected in a clean labeled 1.5 ml tube and stored at −80 °C for RNA-seq analysis. Endothelial cell lysates were subsequently collected in a similar manner.RNA-seq and bioinformatic analysisRNA-seq was performed by Genewiz using a standard RNA-seq package that includes polyA selection and sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq with 150-bp pair-ended reads. Sequence reads were trimmed to remove possible adapter sequences and nucleotides with poor quality using Trimmomatic v.0.36. The trimmed reads were mapped to the Homo sapiens GRCh38 reference genome using the STAR aligner v.2.5.2b. Unique gene hit counts were calculated by using feature Counts from the Subread package v.1.5.2 followed by differential expression analysis using DESeq2. Gene Ontology analysis was performed using Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID, version 6.8)81 and the Enrichplot R package (version 1.14.2). Volcano plots were generated using the EnhancedVolcano R package (version 1.6.0). Heatmaps and scatter plots were generated using the ggplot2 R package (version 3.3.2). Short time-series expression miner (STEM, version 1.3.13)17 was applied to identify significant temporal patterns using the expression profiles of differentially expressed genes. Five significant patterns were identified with p-value < 0.01 and cluster size >300 genes.RT-qPCRTotal RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini plus Kit or the RNeasy Micro plus Kit (Qiagen). After determining RNA concentrations by spectrophotometry, 50–500 ng of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis. Reverse transcription was conducted using the Omniscript RT Kit (Qiagen) or the Sensiscript RT kit (Qiagen). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using the SsoAdvanced- Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Biorad). The specificity of primers was confirmed by melting curve analysis and gel electrophoresis. qPCR was performed on a CFX Connect Real Time PCR Detection System (Biorad). Relative RNA level was quantified using the ΔΔCt method82 and normalized to the endogenous control GAPDH unless specified otherwise. All primers were purchased from IDT (Supplementary Table 1).PBMC study on chipAt 23 h after infection, PBMC was prepared for the adhesion study. PBMC (StemCell, #70025.1) was thawed and resuspend in 10 ml DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin Streptomycin. 10 µl cell tracker green at a final concentration of 10 µM (Invitrogen, #C7025) was used to label cells for 20 min at 37 °C. Then cells were centrifuged and resuspend to 5 × 107/ml. At 24 h after infection, chips were detached from pods and 25 µl labeled PBMC were added to the bottom channel. Chips were flipped and placed on chip cradles. PBMC were allowed to adhere at 37 °C for 2 h before flipped back and washed with 100 µl flow media to wash out unattached cells. Chips were immediately imaged under a fluorescent microscope.For experiments to determine the relative percentages of different types of immune cells recruited on the chip, apheresis collars (a by-product of platelet isolation) were obtained from Brigham and Women’s Hospital under the approval obtained from the Institution Review Board at Harvard University. PBMCs were isolated by density centrifugation using Lymphoprep (StemCell Technologies, #07801), and magnetic beads were used for negative selection of bulk B cells (StemCell Technologies, #19054), T cells (#17951) and monocytes (#19058). Then B cells were stained with CellTracker Deep Red (C34565), T cells with CellTracker Green CMFDA (C7025), monocytes with CellTracker Violet BMQC (C10094), which were subsequently mixed by the ratio 1:3:6 (B Cells: T cells: monocytes). The mixture was then added to the basal channel as the bulk PBMC experiment described. Cells were counted using the Cell Counter plugin in Image J.Flow cytometryMixed immune cells were analyzed using an CytoFlex LX (Beckman coulter), and data were analyzed using FlowJo V10 software (Flowjo, LLC). Cell viability was evaluated using ViaKrome 808 Fixable Viability Dye (1:100 dilution; beckman coulter, C36628). The list of antibodies used for flow cytometry can be found in the antibody list (Supplementary Table 2).Immunostaining and confocal microscopyCells were rinsed with PBS(−/−), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Alfa Aesar) for 20 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS (PBSX) for 10 min, blocked with 5% goat serum (Life Technologies, #50062Z) in PBSX for 1 h at room temperature, and incubated with antibody diluted in blocking buffer (5% goat serum in PBSX) overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature; nuclei were stained with DAPI (Invitrogen) after secondary antibody staining. Cell apoptosis/ necrosis assay kit (Abcam, #ab176749) was used to quantification cell death according to manufacturer’s instructions. Immunostaining of Ki67 (Abcam, # ab15580) was used to measure cell proliferation. Fluorescence imaging was conducted using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (SP5 X MP DMI-6000, Germany) and image processing was done using the ImageJ software (version 2.1.0). DAPI (4′,6-Diamidino-2-Phenylindole, Dihydrochloride) was purchased from Invitrogen (#D1306). The list of antibodies used for immunostaining can be found in the antibody list (Supplementary Table 2).Permeability assayPrior to the assay, both the inlet and outlet reservoirs were emptied. Cascade blue (Life Technologies, # C687) and 3kD Texas red-dextran (Life Technologies, # D3329) were diluted in the flow medium to final concentrations of 100 µg/ml for both tracers, and 500 µl of the mixture was added to the bottom channel inlet reservoir, while 500 µl of the flow medium without the tracers was added to the top channel inlet reservoir. The chips were then flushed for 5 min at a rate of 600 µL/h to allow the dosing solution to fill the Pod and prime the channels. The chips were then flowed at 120 µl/h for both channels for 2 h before collecting medium from the outlet reservoirs and measuring the fluorescence absorbance. The apparent permeability was calculated as previously described36.Cytokine analysisVascular effluents from alveolus chips were collected and analyzed for a panel of cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6, IL-8, IP-10, TNF, RANTES, S100A8/A9, and GM-CSF using custom ProcartaPlex assay kits (Invitrogen). Analyte concentrations were determined using a Luminex100/200 Flexmap3D instrument coupled with Luminex XPONENT software (Luminex, USA, version 4.2). S100A7 was measured using an ELISA kit (Aviva Systems Biology) according to manufacturer’s instruction.Cytotoxicity assayVascular outflows from the alveolus chip were collected 48 h after pretreatment with TRPV4 or RAGE inhibitor. The amount of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was measured as a readout for cytotoxicity using the LDH-Glo Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega, # J2380) following manufacturer’s instruction.Drug treatment on-chipAzeliragon (TTP-488) and FPS-ZM1 were purchased from MedChemExpress (#HY-50682) and Sigma (#553030), respectively. Molnupiravir (EIDD-1931) was purchased from Cayman Chemical (#9002958). TRPV4 inhibitor GSK2193874 was purchased from Tocris Bioscience (#No. 5106). Drugs were diluted using alveolus chip flow media with a final DMSO concentration of 0.5% and perfused at 30 µl/h through the vascular channel prophylactically or therapeutically at the time points and doses indicated in each figure.Culture and transfection of A549 cellsA549 cells (ATCC CCL-185) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Life Technologies) and penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies). All cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Transfection was performed using TransIT-X2 Dynamic Delivery System (Mirus) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. pCMV6-XL5 empty plasmid (PCMV6XL5) and S100A7 plasmid were purchased from Origene (#SC122639). RAGE plasmid was purchased from Sino Biological (HG11629-ACG). Endotoxin-free plasmid purification was performed by Genewiz.Culture and transfection of human primary alveolar epithelial cellsPrimary human lung alveolar epithelial cells (Cell Biologics, H-6053) were seeded on 0.1% gelatin-coated 12-well plate according to manufacturer’s instruction. When reaching 70% confluent, cells were transfected with pCMV6-XL5 empty plasmid or S100A7 plasmid using TransIT-X2 Dynamic Delivery System (Mirus).Transfection in human alveolus chipHuman alveolus chips were transfected with plasmid DNA using the TransIT-X2 reagent (Mirus Bio). In all, 3 μg of plasmid DNA and 6 μl TransIT-X2 reagent were constituted in 300 μl OPT-MEM before added to 3 ml chip flow medium. Then 1.5 ml of the solution was added to apical and basal inlet reservoirs and flew at 60 μl/h for 24 h. Then apical channel was emptied to reestablish ALI; basal channel was changed to normal flow medium for additional 24 h before qPCR analysis.Plaque assayVirus titers were determined by plaque assay. Confluent MDCK cell monolayers in 12-well plate were washed with PBS, inoculated with 1 mL of 10-fold serial dilutions of influenza virus samples for 1 h at 37 °C, and then overlaid with 1 mL of DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 1.5% low melting point agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) and 2 µg/mL TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich). 2–4 days after incubation at 37 °C under 5% CO2, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Alfa Aesar) and stained with crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich) to visualize the plaques; virus titers were determined as plaque-forming units per milliliter (PFU/mL).StatisticsEach experiment was repeated at least three times, with at least three biological replicates for each data point.

Innovators & Disruptors Economy 4.0 MoneyWatch Managing Your Money Your Taxes Retirement Watch CBS News MoneyWatch Bird flu's grisly question: How to kill millions of poultry April 7, 2022 / 3:26 PM EDT / CBS/AP The spread of a bird flu in the U.S. that is deadly to poultry raises the grisly question of how farms manage to quickly kill and dispose of millions of chickens and turkeys.It's a chore that farms across the country are increasingly facing as the number of poultry killed in the past two months has climbed to more than 24 million, with outbreaks reported nearly every day. Some farms have had to kill more than 5 million chickens at a single site with a goal of destroying the birds within 24 hours to limit the spread of the disease and prevent animals from suffering."The faster we can get on site and depopulate the birds that remain on site, the better," Minnesota State Veterinarian Beth Thompson said. The latest outbreak of bird flu, also called avian influenza, is the biggest since 2015, when producers had to kill more than 50 million birds. So far this year, there have been cases in 24 states, with Iowa the hardest hit with about 13 million chickens and turkeys killed. Other states with sizable outbreaks include Minnesota, Wisconsin, South Dakota and Indiana.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, birds can catch the flu when they come into contact with the saliva, nasal secretions or feces of an infected bird. The flu is considered to be "very contagious among birds" and can kill certain domesticated species like chickens and turkeys, according to the agency. Although human cases of avian viruses are rare, some have been reported. Humans can become infected when enough of the virus gets into their eyes, nose or mouth. Humans cannot get the disease from poultry or eggs that are properly handled and cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the USDA. Once a person is infected, symptoms range from conjunctivitis, fever, diarrhea and vomiting to severe respiratory illness and neurological changes. Lethal foamFarms faced with the need to kill so many birds turn to recommendations by the American Veterinary Medical Association. Even as it has developed methods to kill the poultry quickly, the association acknowledges its techniques "may not guarantee that the deaths the animals face are painless and distress free." Veterinarians and U.S. Department of Agriculture officials also typically oversee the process.One of the preferred methods is to spray water-based firefighting foam over birds as they roam around the ground inside a barn. That foam kills the animals by cutting off their air supply.When foam won't work because birds are in cages above the ground or it's too cold, the USDA recommends sealing up barns and piping carbon dioxide inside, first rendering the birds unconscious and ultimately killing them. If one those methods won't work because equipment or workers aren't available, or when the size of a flock is too large, the association said a last resort is a technique called ventilation shutdown. In that scenario, farmers stop airflow into barns, which raises temperatures to levels at which the animals die. The USDA and the veterinary association recommend that farmers add additional heat or carbon dioxide to barns to speed up the process and limit suffering by the animals.Mike Stepien, a spokesman for the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said the techniques are the best options when it's necessary to quickly kill so many birds."State animal health officials and producers carefully weigh the different options to determine the best option for humane depopulation and do not make such decisions lightly," Stepien said."We have to do better"Not everyone agrees.Animal welfare groups argue that all these methods for quickly killing birds are inhumane, though they are particularly opposed to ventilation shutdown, which they note can take hours and is akin to leaving a dog in a hot car. Animal rights groups delivered a petition last year signed by 3,577 people involved in caring for animals, including nearly 1,600 veterinarians, that urged the veterinary association to stop recommending ventilation shutdown as an option."We have to do better. None of these are acceptable in any way," said Sara Shields, director of farm animal welfare science at Humane Society International. Opponents of the standard techniques said firefighting foam uses harmful chemicals and it essentially drowns birds, causing chickens and turkeys to suffer convulsions and cardiac arrest as they die. They say carbon dioxide is painful to inhale and detectible by the birds, prompting them to try to flee the gas. Land is prepared for the disposal of nearly 3 million chickens after avian influenza, or bird blu, was recently discovered at a commercial egg operation on March 24, 2022, near Palmyra, Wisconsin. / Getty Images Karen Davis, of the nonprofit group United Poultry Concerns, urged the veterinary association to stop recommending all of its three main options."They're all ways that I would not choose to die, and I would not choose anybody else to die regardless of what species they belong to," Davis said.Shields said there are more humane alternatives, such as using nitrogen gas but those options tend to be more expensive and could have logistical challenges.Protecting the food supplySam Krouse, vice president of Indiana-based MPS Egg Farms, said farmers feel miserable about using any of the options."We pour our lives and livelihoods into taking care of those birds, and it's just devastating when we lose any of those birds," Krouse said. "Everything that we're doing every day is focused on keeping the disease out and making sure that we're keeping our hens as safe as possible."Officials emphasize that this virus that's spread primarily through the droppings of infected wild birds doesn't threaten food safety or represent a significant public health threat. Sick birds aren't allowed into the food supply and properly cooking poultry and eggs kills any viruses that might be present. And health officials say no human cases of bird flu have been found in the United States during this current outbreak. Once poultry are dead, farmers must quickly dispose of the birds. They usually don't want to risk the chance of spreading the virus by transporting the carcasses to landfills, so crews typically pile the birds up into huge rows inside barns and combine them with other materials, such as ground up corn stalks and sawdust to create a compost pile.After a couple weeks of decomposition, the carcasses are converted into a material that can be spread on cropland to help fertilize crops. In some cases, carcasses are buried in trenches on the farm or incinerated.

April 08, 2022 A fast-spreading bird flu is now threatening the livelihood of New England farmers. In the two months since the first outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza was reported in Indiana, farmers across the country have killed nearly 23 million chickens and turkeys to limit its spread. With recent outbreaks of virus in New England, farmers in the region are taking precautions to prevent their flocks from meeting the same fate. Jeremiah Vernon raises about 20,000 chickens a year just outside Stratham, New Hampshire. He is now moving the chickens who roam in pastures under cover to protect them from avian influenza.“If we were to get AI [avian influenza], all the birds in the farm would have to be euthanized. And we would have not be allowed to have birds here for 150 days,” Vernon said.

Morning Edition Birds can contract the disease if they come into contact with contaminated surfaces or objects. Anne Diemond Bacci, co-owner of Diamond Farm in Millers Falls, Massachusetts, said she is trying to prevent people who visit the farm from accidentally spreading the virus to their poultry. “We have set up washing stations at all the entrances to the buildings. … We have mats that have sanitizer in them, and so when people come there's a sign that says, ‘Please wipe your feet on the provided mats,” she said. The U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed one outbreak occurred at a backyard turkey farm in Western Massachusetts in late March. The department also reported 13 cases of avian influenza in wild bird populations in Barnstable and Middlesex counties in early March. Elsewhere in New England, New Hampshire reported a backyard mixed-species outbreak and 54 reported cases among wild birds; Connecticut has reported one backyard farm outbreak and 32 cases among wild birds; Maine has reported 12 backyard farm outbreaks and eight cases in wild birds; and Vermont has reported just two cases in wild birds.The avian flu currently poses a low risk to humans, although people who frequently interact with birds may have a higher risk of infection, the CDC reported. Any unexpected deaths in flocks or other signs of the flu should be reported immediately to the Massachusetts Division of Animal Health at 617-626-1795 or through their online reporting form.

It has spread to at least 24 states in less than two months. National What we know about the deadliest U.S. bird flu outbreak in 7 years April 6, 20225:00 AM ET By Bill Chappell Enlarge this image The price of eggs has risen sharply since the start of a bird flu outbreak that has resulted in millions of birds being culled. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images The price of eggs has risen sharply since the start of a bird flu outbreak that has resulted in millions of birds being culled. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images A highly pathogenic bird flu virus is tearing its way through U.S. farms and chicken yards, spreading to at least 24 states less than two months after the first outbreak was reported in a commercial flock. Nearly 23 million birds have died. It's the worst U.S. outbreak of the avian flu since 2015, when more than 50 million birds died. The outbreak is driving up consumer prices for eggs and chicken meat that, like many costs, had already been rising due to inflation. Here's what you need to know about the outbreak. 22,851,072 birds have been wiped out Some birds have died from the disease itself, but the vast majority are being culled to try to stop the deadly and highly infectious virus from spreading. That includes millions of chickens and turkeys in barns and backyards that had been raised to provide eggs or meat. Sponsor Message Your Money Food prices are going up — and at levels Americans haven't seen in decades One of the worst-hit states is Iowa, where more than 5 million birds died at an egg-laying facility in Osceola on March 31, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Overall, more than 13 million birds have been culled in the state. As of around noon ET on Tuesday, 72 commercial flocks and 46 backyard flocks were reported to be infected around the country. The bird flu poses only a low risk to humans, the CDC says It's rare for a human to become infected with the avian virus. No human infections of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), which includes the H5N1 bird flu virus, have ever been reported in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The virus does not pose a special risk in the nation's food supply, either; the CDC states that like any poultry or eggs, proper handling and heating food to an internal temperature of 165˚F kills any bacteria and viruses present — including any HPAI viruses. There have been only four human infections of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses ever in the U.S., the CDC says, noting that those cases resulted in only mild or moderate illness. The virus was first reported in wild birds The first U.S. warning of the new outbreak came on Jan. 13, when the USDA announced a strain of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus had been found in wild birds for the first time since 2016. Many of those first cases were in South Carolina and North Carolina, in birds killed by hunters. Sponsor Message The cases then spread north as wild birds migrated and spread the virus to farms. On Feb. 9, an outbreak was confirmed at a commercial turkey flock in Dubois County, Ind. Business Avian flu is infecting U.S. poultry flocks. It could affect the price of chicken, too Ben Slinger, whose family raises turkeys for a meat processor, recently told Iowa Public Radio that he's taking precautions to protect his flocks from infection, after they had to cull tens of thousands of birds in 2015. In addition to using disinfectant, workers wear separate pairs of boots for each barn. "We know what the aftermath of that is like, and it is pretty disheartening," Slinger said. Known cases now range from Maine to Texas, where the virus was found in a commercial pheasant flock in Erath County on Sunday.

Scott Olson/Getty Images hide caption toggle caption Scott Olson/Getty Images Land is prepared for the disposal of nearly 3 million chickens after avian influenza was recently discovered at a commercial egg operation near Palmyra, Wis. Scott Olson/Getty Images Grocery prices for chicken are rising For the current week, the average U.S. price of chicken breasts rose to $3.93 per pound at major supermarkets — sharply higher than last week's $3.14 price. A year ago, the price was $2.48, the Agriculture Department says. Egg prices have also gone up compared to 2021, and breast tenders cost a full dollar more now than they did a year ago, according to the USDA. "Prices for white parts are on the rise" with a few exceptions, the department said. "The cost for dark meat items are also increasing; bulk pack drumsticks, thighs, and leg quarters take up most of the spotlight." The last outbreak lasted about 6 months The bird flu outbreak that peaked in the late spring of 2015 was "the largest poultry health disaster in U.S. history," the USDA says. Many of those infections were reported in Iowa and neighboring states near "the intersection of the Central and Mississippi flyways used by wild birds during seasonal migration," the agency said. That's the same region that's now being hit hard by the virus. In the 2015 outbreak, fomites — objects that can transfer disease — were seen as a key source of viral transmission. Such items include the boots and clothing of poultry industry employees and vehicles used to spread feed. Officials also pointed to the dense concentration of some production facilities as a source of case clusters. Sponsor Message The 2015 outbreak tapered sharply and ended in June of that year — but 3 million birds still died in that final month. Because of the lingering effect on the supply chain, it wasn't until several more months later that some poultry prices peaked and then normalized, according to the USDA. avian flu bird flu Facebook Flipboard Email Read & Listen Home News Culture Music Podcasts & Shows Connect Newsletters Facebook Instagram Press Public Editor Corrections Contact & Help About NPR Overview Diversity NPR Network Accessibility Ethics Finances Get Involved Support Public Radio Sponsor NPR NPR Careers NPR Shop NPR Events NPR Extra Terms of Use Privacy Your Privacy Choices Text Only Sponsor MessageBecome an NPR sponsorComparing protein–protein interaction networks of SARS-CoV-2 and (H1N1) influenza using topological features | Scientific Reports Skip to main content Thank you for visiting nature.com.

It has since infected more than 298 million individuals and caused over 5 million deaths globally. The identification of essential proteins in a protein–protein interaction network (PPIN) is not only crucial in understanding the process of cellular life but also useful in drug discovery. There are many centrality measures to detect influential nodes in complex networks. Since SARS-CoV-2 and (H1N1) influenza PPINs pose 553 common human proteins. Analyzing influential proteins and comparing these networks together can be an effective step in helping biologists for drug-target prediction. We used 21 centrality measures on SARS-CoV-2 and (H1N1) influenza PPINs to identify essential proteins. We applied principal component analysis and unsupervised machine learning methods to reveal the most informative measures. Appealingly, some measures had a high level of contribution in comparison to others in both PPINs, namely Decay, Residual closeness, Markov, Degree, closeness (Latora), Barycenter, Closeness (Freeman), and Lin centralities. We also investigated some graph theory-based properties like the power law, exponential distribution, and robustness. Both PPINs tended to properties of scale-free networks that expose their nature of heterogeneity. Dimensionality reduction and unsupervised learning methods were so effective to uncover appropriate centrality measures.

It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The coronavirus Covid-19 has been affecting 220 countries and territories around the world. As of 7 January 2022, over 298 million cases have been confirmed cases and more than 5 million confirmed deaths attributed to the COVID-19 virus1.Considering the high complexity of biological systems, one of the most challenging problems in experimental biology is designing a reliable experimental paradigm2. On the other hand, the aim of systems biology is to provide appropriate models with computational approaches using observational biological data, deposited in bioinformatics databases. These models are used for predicting purposes which in turn are useful for further experimental design3.In the past several years, extensive experiments and data evolution have provided a good opportunity for systematic analysis and a comprehensive understanding of the topology of biological networks and biochemical processes in the cell4. In other words, we need to choose the right essential proteins to be targeted by new drugs5. However, identifying appropriate target proteins through experimental methods is time-consuming and expensive5,6,7. Both SARS-CoV-2 and (H1N1) influenza viruses have similar clinical symptoms8. Essential proteins play a vital role in the survival and development of the cell. They are also the most important materials in a variety of life processes. In cellular life, proteins are the chief actors that carry out the duties specified by the information encoded in genes9. The identification of essential proteins is decisive to understanding the minimal requirements for cellular life and practical purposes, such as a better understanding of diseases, and drug discovery10. Studying SARS-CoV-2 and (H1N1) influenza PPINs can be helpful to investigate similarities and differences between them. Studies have shown that protein–human protein interactions are biologically involved in multiple heterogeneous processes, including protein trafficking, translation, transcription, and regulation of ubiquitination5,11. For a more accurate understanding of their importance in cell life, it has to identify various interactions and determine the consequences of the interactions12. Moreover, this can use to empirically investigate complex network properties such as degree distribution13, power-law14, and other topological features.Hahn et al.15 examined essential proteins in PPINs of eukaryotes: yeast, worm, and fly through three centrality measures. The results showed that there is a clear relationship between central proteins and survival. To detect which centrality measure is more suitable for choosing essential proteins in PPINs, Ernesto16 investigated the relationships between several centrality measures and subgraph centrality with essential proteins in the yeast PPIN. His study indicates that protein essentiality appears to be related to how much a protein is involved in clusters of proteins. As a result, subgraph centrality outperformed better than other measures for detecting essential proteins. Ashtiani et al.17 surveyed 27 centrality measures on yeast protein–protein interaction networks for ranking the nodes in all PPINs. They examined the correlation between centrality measures through unsupervised machine learning methods.Although, in the context of analyzing PPINs, the comparison of different networks is challenging. There are various gene profiling for SARS-CoV-2 and (H1N1) influenza in the GenBank database18,19. Unfortunately, it has not been done APMS (affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry) for building corresponding PPINs for most of them. These experimental procedures require considerable time and resources. In this work, we adopt the human protein–protein interaction (PPI) data set from20,21 database to compare SARS-CoV-2 and (H1N1) influenza PPINs. Using these networks, we then analyze the topological features, focusing on the properties of the graphs which represent these networks. We consider some specific measures, such as graph density, degree distribution, and 21 different centrality measures. We fit power law and exponential distributions on these networks and calculate alpha power and R-squared values.Materials and methodsMaterialsThere are four different types of Coronaviruses (CoVs) includes Alphacoronoavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus20. Betacoronavirus includes five subtypes among Embecovirus, Sarbecovirus, Merbecovirus, Nobecovirus, and Hibecovirus. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are from Sarbecovirus (SV) subgenus. Khorsand et al.20 created a Sarbecovirus-human protein–protein interaction network. We have derived SARS-CoV-2 PPINs from this dataset. For (H1N1) influenza PPIN, Khorsand et al.21 made Comprehensive PPINs for all genres of Alphainfluenza viruses (IAV). The main human influenza pathogens are Alphainfluenza viruses (IAV) that include subtypes of combining one of the 16 hemagglutinin (HA: H1–H16) with one of the 9 neuraminidase (NA: N1–N9) surface antigens. We have downloaded the whole network and separated (H1N1) influenza PPIN from the Alphainfluenza protein–protein interaction network. SARS-CoV-2 PPIN contains 1922 interactions between 14 SARS-CoV-2 proteins and 1395 human proteins and (H1N1) influenza PPIN contains 9174 interactions between 46 (H1N1) influenza proteins and 2751 human proteins.MethodsWe propose a useful analysis approach to compare SARS-CoV-2 and (H1N1) influenza PPINs. At first, we need to select a valid dataset and so, investigate and select suitable features that are meaningful in a biological system. Next, we develop our approach to make comparisons and the results are analyzed. In the following, we describe how to deal with these phases, respectively. The process starts by computing global network properties. In the next phase, 21 different centrality measures are applied to both networks, standard normalization and PCA are used on centrality values, respectively. Using some machine learning methods, the centrality measures are compared and analyzed.Network Global propertiesIn this study, we have considered some of the network properties such as graph density, graph diameter, and centralization. In the following, we review these network concepts. All these properties are calculated and analyzed in both networks using igraph22 R package. Then, the power-law distribution is checked out by computing α and R-squared values. R-squared is the percentage of the response variable variation that is described by a linear model23.Although, PPINs are directed but most of analyzing methods consider PPINs as undirected24,25. For this research study, we considered PPINs as undirected and loop-free connected graphs. So, let \(G = \left( {V, E} \right)\) be an undirected graph. This graph consists of nodes represented by \(V = \left\{ {v_{1},v_{2} , \ldots } \right\}\) and edges \(E = \left\{ {e_{1} ,e_{2} , \ldots } \right\}\) such that any edge \(e_{ij} \in E\) represents the connection between nodes \(v_{i}\) and \(v_{j} \in V\).Graph densityThe density of a graph is the fraction of the number of edges to the number of possible edges26. Density is equal to \(2*\left| E \right|\) divided by |\(V|*\left( {\left| V \right| - 1} \right)\). A complete graph has density 1; the minimal density of any graph is 0. There are some features for identifying biological networks. Often, biological networks are incomplete or heterogeneous which means very low density27.Graph diameterIn a network, diameter is the longest shortest path between any two vertices \(\left( {u,v} \right)\), where d \( \left( {u,v} \right)\) is a graph distance28.HeterogeneityThe network heterogeneity is defined as the coefficient of variation of the connectivity distribution:$$ {\text{Heterogeneity}} = \frac{{\sqrt {variance\left( k \right)} }}{mean\left( k \right)} $$ (1) In PPINs, the connectivity \(k_{i}\) of node \(i\) equals the number of directly linked neighbors. PPINs tend to be very heterogeneous. Highly connected 'hub' nodes in PPINs have an important role in the network. A hub protein is essential and contains many distinct binding sites to accommodate non-hub proteins29.CentralizationCentralization is a method that gives information about the topology of a network. Centralization is measured from the centrality scores of the vertices. The centralization that closes to 1, illustrates that probably the network has a star-like topology. If it is closer to 0, the more likely topology of the network is like square whereas every node of the network has at least 2 neighbors)28. This metric is calculated as follows30:$$ C_{x} = \frac{{\mathop \sum \nolimits_{i = 1}^{N} [C_{x} \left( {p_{*} } \right) - C_{x} \left( {p_{i} } \right)]}}{{\max \mathop \sum \nolimits_{i = 1}^{N} [C_{x} \left( {p_{*} } \right) - C_{x} \left( {p_{i} } \right)]}} $$ (2) where \(C_{x} \left( {p_{i} } \right)\) is any centrality measure of point \( i\) and \(C_{x} \left( {p_{i*} } \right)\) is the largest such measure in the network. Each centrality measure can be used (betweenness centrality, closeness centrality and etc.).Centrality analysisIn this work, the following 21 centrality measures are selected: Average Distance31, Barycenter32, Closeness (Freeman)30, Closeness (Latora)33, Residual closeness34, Decay35, Diffusion degree36, Geodesic K-Path37,38, Laplacian39, Leverage40, Lin41, Lobby42, Markov43, Radiality44, Eigenvector45, Subgraph scores16, Shortest-Paths betweenness30, Eccentricity46, Degree28, Kleinberg’s authority scores47, and Kleinberg’s hub scores47. These measures are calculated using the centiserve48 and igraph22 R packages. We have classified the centrality measures into five distinct classes including Distance-, Degree-, Eigen-, Neighborhood-based and Miscellaneous groups depend on their logic and formulas (Table 1). Tables 2 and 3 show the definitions for 21 different centrality measures based on their group.Table 1 Centrality measures. The centrality measures are classified in five groups depending on their logic and formula.Full size tableTable 2 Definitions for distance based centrality measures.Full size tableTable 3 Definitions for Degree based, Eigen based, Neighborhood based, and Miscellaneous centrality measures.Full size tableUnsupervised machine learning analysisprincipal component analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality-reduction method that is often used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets, by linear transforming a large set of variables into smaller ones50. PCA aims to remove correlated centralities, reduce overfitting, and better visualization. Since the values of centrality measures are in different scales and PCA is affected by scale, Standard normalization has been undertaken on centrality measures before applying PCA. This phase is significant because it helps to recognize which centrality measures can determine influence nodes within a network. Then, PCA is used on normalized computed centrality measures. In the next phase, it is assessed that whether it is feasible to cluster the centrality measures in both networks according to clustering tendency. Before applying any clustering method to the dataset, it is important to evaluate whether the data sets contain meaningful clusters or not. For assessment of the feasibility of the clustering analysis, the Hopkins’ statistic values and visualizing VAT (Visual Assessment of Cluster Tendency) plots are calculated by factoextra R package51. Some validation measures are used to select the most suitable clustering method among hierarchical, k-means, and PAM (Partitioning Around Medoids) methods using the clValid package52. In this study, we apply Silhouette scores to select the appropriate method. After the choice of the clustering method, factoextra package is employed to find the optimal number of clusters51. In the clustering procedure, Ward’s Method53 is used as a dissimilarity measure. Ward’s minimum variance method creates groups such that variance is minimized within clusters.Results and discussionsEvaluation of network propertiesIn this study, both networks were examined to compare global properties. The network global properties were computed for both networks (Table 4). Firstly, we compared the networks based on their nodes. We realized that SARS-CoV-2 and (H1N1) influenza PPINs include 553 common human proteins. The list of these proteins is available and provided as supplementary material (Supplementary File 1). The densities of SARS-CoV-2 and (H1N1) influenza PPINs were computed at 0.0019 and 0.0023 that was expected because biological networks are usually sparse. The network diameters were equal in both networks. SARS-CoV-2 and (H1N1) influenza PPINs were correlated to the power-law distribution with high alpha power and R-squared values. In terms of comparison of heterogeneity values, SARS-CoV-2 PPIN achieved a higher value. But, both networks are relatively heterogeneous. The heterogeneous network exhibits many unique properties of scale-free networks54. Values of network centralization were very close together. Figure 1 demonstrates power law (red curve) and exponential (blue curve) distributions in SARS-CoV-2 and (H1N1) influenza PPINs. Both the degree distributions were left-skewed analogous to scale-free networks.Table 4 Network global properties of SARS-CoV-2 and (H1N1) influenza PPINs.Full size tableFigure 1Fitting both SARS-CoV-2 and (H1N1) influenza PPINs on power-law distribution.Full size imageCentrality analysisIn the next phase, the 21 centrality measures of nodes were calculated in both networks. The centrality measures were divided into two groups according to Table 2: (1) Distance based and (2) Degree based, Eigen based, and Neighborhood based. The top 10 essential proteins identified by 21 centrality measures in PPINs are given in as supplementary material (Supplementary File 2) for experimental validation. The r Pearson correlation coefficients between centralities in two groups and pairwise scatter plots of centrality measures were also shown in Figs. 2 and 3. These plots illustrate that there is a clear correlation in some of the centrality measures. For a better comparison, we also provided the dissimilarity matrix based on the Pearson correlation coefficient for all centrality measures in both networks (Fig. 4). The Pearson correlation coefficient puts within the range [− 1,1]. In some applications, such as clustering, it can be reasonable to transform the correlation coefficient to a dissimilarity measure52. In this way, the Pearson distance lies in the interval [0,2]. A value of 0 indicates that would not be a correlation between the two centrality measures. The higher value demonstrates the more correlation between them. In both networks, the matrixes indicate a high positive association between Average Distance and Radiality centrality measures are highly associated together. Furthermore, in (H1N1) influenza, these correlations are more clear between Average Distance and Lin, Barycenter, Closeness (Freeman), Radiality, Closeness (Latora), Residual closeness, and Decay measures.Figure 2r Pearson correlation coefficients between centralities in the group of Distance based and pairwise scatter plots of centrality measures.Full size imageFigure 3r Pearson correlation coefficients between centralities in the group of Degree based, Eigen based, and Neighborhood based and pairwise scatter plots of centrality measures.Full size imageFigure 4The dissimilarity matrix based on the Pearson correlation coefficient for all centrality measures in both networks.Full size imageDimensionality reduction and clustering analysisIn the next phase, PCA-based dimensionality reduction was applied to centrality measures to show a visual representation of the dominant centrality measures in the data set. The profile of the distance to the center of the plots and their directions were mostly harmonic for both networks as illustrated in Fig. 5. The contribution of each centrality measure for two dimensions is given as supplementary material (Supplementary File 3). The percentage of contribution of variables (i.e. centrality measures) in a given PC was computed as (variable. Cos2*100)/(total Cos2 of the component)). Figure 6 illustrates the first ten contributing centrality measures to PCA for two dimensions. In both networks, the contribution percent for the first ten contributors is too close for the first dimension. For the second dimension, degree centrality is the major contributor for both PPINs. Eigenvector and Eccentricity revealed a low contribution value in both PPINs. In contrast, Closeness (Latora) displayed high levels of contribution in both networks whilst it was the first rank of SARS-CoV-2 PPIN contributors and second rank of (H1N1) influenza PPIN contributors. Also, we have acquired the contribution of each centrality measure for two dimensions sorted by the p-value of the correlation (Supplementary File 4 and 5). The significance level in this study was considered equal to 0.05. A lower p-value in the results exhibits a strong relationship between centrality measures in both networks.Figure 5Biplot representation of the centrality measures in SARS-CoV-2 and (H1N1) influenza PPINs. In each plot, nodes were shown as points and centrality measures as vectors.Full size imageFigure 6The top 10 centrality measures contributing to PCA for two dimensions.Full size imageUltimately, we performed unsupervised classification to cluster centrality values computed in PPINs. First, we executed a clustering tendency procedure. For clustering centrality values in each network, we considered Hopkins statistics were more than the threshold. The threshold value was 0.0517. The results are provided in the first column of Table 5 and supplementary material (Supplementary File 6). Then, silhouette scores were calculated in three methods (i.e. hierarchical, k-means, and PAM) and average Silhouette width were evaluated in clustering the data sets. These scores are available and provided as supplementary material (Supplementary File 7). Finally, based on average Silhouette width, the k-means method was selected for clustering centrality values in both PPINs (Fig. 7). The outputs of the clustering method and the corresponding number of clusters were also shown in Table 5. The optimal number of clusters was also determined by k-means and PAM clustering algorithms. These results are given as supplementary material (Supplementary File 8). The centrality measures were clustered in each PPINs using the hierarchical algorithm based on Ward’s method50 that was shown in Fig. 8.Table 5 Clustering information values for PPINs.Full size tableFigure 7(A) Clustering silhouette plot of the combined-score PPIN.

Silhouette scores of centrality measures illustrated the centrality measures in the same clusters had very close contribution values for these measures (Fig. 7). In SARS-CoV-2 PPIN, Barycenter, Decay, Diffusion degree, Closeness (Freeman), Geodesic K-Path, Closeness (Latora), Lin, Radiality, and Residual closeness measures were in the same cluster. Also, in (H1N1) influenza, Barycenter, Decay, Closeness (Freeman), Closeness (Latora), Lin, Radiality, and Residual closeness were measures were in the same cluster. The average silhouette scores were 0.55 and 0.71 in these clusters for SARS-CoV-2 and (H1N1) influenza PPINs, respectively. The centrality measures namely Shortest-Paths betweenness, Laplacian, Degree, and Markov measures were in a cluster for SARS-CoV-2 PPIN where the mean of their silhouette scores (i.e. 0.48) was higher than the overall average, and in the same way, their corresponding contribution values were high, too. Kleinberg’s hub and Kleinberg’s authority scores are grouped in a cluster in both PPINs and their corresponding contribution values were equal.Our results demonstrated that an exclusive profile of centrality measures including Barycenter, Decay, Closeness (Freeman), Closeness (Latora), Lin, Radiality, and Residual closeness was the most significant index to determine essential nodes. We inferred that both PPINs have close results in centrality analysis. Also, our research confirmed an analogous study17 about the relationship between contribution value derived from PCA and silhouette width as a cluster validation. Furthermore, our centrality analysis resulted in many equal values in all centrality measures that imply dynamic robustness in PPINs. Also, it reveals that PPINs due to sparsity and tree-like topology are more explorable than random networks with higher connectivity55.ConclusionSARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus mostly known as COVID-19, has become a matter of critical concern around the world. Besides, network-based methods have emerged to analyze, and understand complex behavior in biological systems with a focus on topological features. In recent decades, network-based ranking methods have provided systematic analysis for predicting influence proteins and proposing drug target candidates in the treatment of types of cancer and biomarker discovery. SARS-CoV-2 and (H1N1) influenza PPINs have 553 common human proteins. Studying and comparing these networks can be an effective step to identify new drug compounds for biological targets.In this study, we have analyzed SARS-CoV-2 and (H1N1) influenza PPINs topologically. We employed heterogeneity measure to PPINs. The heterogeneity results and fitting distributions demonstrated the properties of scale-free networks in both networks. Subsequently, 21 centrality measures were utilized to prioritize the proteins in both networks. We illustrated that dimensionality reduction methods like PCA can help to extract more relevant features (i.e. centrality measures) and corresponding relationships in unsupervised machine learning methods. Thus, to detect influential nodes in biological networks, PCA can help to select suitable measures. In other words, dimensionality reduction methods can illuminate which measures have the highest contribution values, i.e., which measures contain much more useful information about centrality.

Register ADVERTISEMENT PCR testing of nasal swabs is the recommended method for diagnosing equine influenza. | Courtesy University of Florida Q. I hear that the equine flu is going around right now. Should I be worried? How can I protect my horses? A. Great question! And, yes, it is indeed flu season for horses. Equine influenza (EI), or “flu,” is a highly contagious respiratory virus that can affect horses of all ages. Similar to flu in people, transmission occurs through direct contact (especially nose to nose) and inhalation of aerosolized respiratory droplets from coughing horses. It can also be transmitted via people’s hands, grooming tools, and contact with communal surfaces. Horses with flu develop fever (a temperature of at least 101.5 degrees F), cough, and crusty nasal discharge. Some also show signs of generalized illness (e.g., reduced appetite, lethargy). Nearly all infected horses recover from flu, but it can take weeks to months for their respiratory systems to fully heal after infection. Equine influenza is preventable with a vaccination that’s considered a risk-based vaccine by the American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP). This means horse owners should discuss with their veterinarians whether the flu vaccine is right for their horses. It is generally recommended for any horse coming into contact with new horses—whether that be through travel on and off the property or by living in a barn where other horses come and go. It is also usually a good idea to vaccinate all young horses for flu, as they tend to be more susceptible to developing severe signs of illness when infected. So, what should you do to protect your horse? First, make sure he is up to date on his annual vaccinations. This is especially important here where I’m located in Florida, where mosquito season—and the spread of diseases such as Eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) and West Nile virus (WNV)—begins early. If your barn is experiencing an outbreak of flu, talk to your veterinarian about administering an intranasal flu booster to the horses that have not yet shown any signs of illness. This vaccine can provide immunity in as little as five days and is one of the few vaccines recommended for use in the face of an outbreak. Finally, whenever traveling with your horse, take his temperature twice daily and watch closely for signs of coughing, reduced appetite, or general illness. As always, report any abnormal observations to your veterinarian. Share SallyAnne L. DeNotta, DVM, PhD, Dipl. ACVIM SallyAnne L. DeNotta, DVM, PhD, Dipl.

As of this week, highly pathogenic avian influenza has been found in 24 states and has resulted in the death of 23 million birds. Highly pathogenic avian influenza has affected more than 1 million birds at more than 20 sites in Minnesota as of the first week of April 2022.Contributed By Alex Derosier April 08, 2022 at 10:15 AM Share Share this article ST. PAUL — Minnesota poultry farms are being hit by an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza that has already affected more than 1 million birds at more than 20 sites across the state.As of this week, 23 million birds have been affected in 24 states in the worst avian influenza outbreak in U.S. poultry flocks since 2015. Here’s what we know so far: ADVERTISEMENT What is HPAI? Highly pathogenic avian influenza — or HPAI — is caused by a highly contagious virus that is generally lethal to domesticated birds. There are other strains of avian influenza that are considered low pathogenic where birds either show mild signs of illness or none at all. Once exposed to infection, birds die within about 48 hours, according to Beth Thompson, state veterinarian and executive director of the Minnesota Board of Animal Health.The virus is of particular concern in Minnesota, as the state is the top turkey producer in the U.S. Each year, producers raise about 40 million birds . In the 2015 outbreak farmers lost millions, and nationally the federal government response cost billions of dollars.Thompson said the H5N1 influenza virus currently affecting U.S. flocks was present in Europe more than a year ago. It eventually spread to North America, where migratory birds have been spreading it to poultry operations across the U.S. and Canada.During the 2015 outbreak, 23 counties and more than 100 farms were affected by the virus. While it’s too early to say how severe the current outbreak could become, as of Thursday officials had confirmed the virus’s presence in about a dozen Minnesota counties.As of this week, it is affecting about half of the states in the U.S. and has resulted in the death of 23 million birds in states including Iowa and Wyoming. Thompson said the current outbreak already appears much more widespread than the one in 2015 when more than 50 million birds died of disease or were euthanized. Minnesota Minnesota Legislature sends $1 million emergency bird flu funding to governor's desk To date, the avian influenza has been detected in 21 Minnesota flocks, affecting 1 million birds. Apr 7, 2022 · By Dana Ferguson Transmission The current outbreak of avian influenza virus is being spread by migrating birds, which can be infected without appearing sick. Geese and ducks are on the move as winter ends, and when they land, they can leave fecal matter containing the virus. Avian influenza is so contagious that small amounts of contamination on a farmer's boots could trigger an outbreak in a coop. ADVERTISEMENT "The lakes are starting to open up, the ponds are starting to open up," Thompson said. "All it takes is just a little bit of that fecal matter, and it could be as something as simple as walking through a puddle."There are multiple migratory corridors in the continental U.S. including the East Coast wild waterfowl pathway, one that comes up the Mississippi River, and one just west of Minnesota known as the Central Flyway. There is also a west coast pathway called the Pacific Flyway. The virus is present in all of them, Thompson said.How this outbreak plays out depends on many factors, but warmer weather could be a big help."We need the sunshine. We need summer to come, we need the environment to dry out we need the environment to warm up and we need the wild waterfowl and migratory birds to complete their path up to their northern nesting grounds so they stop flying over the state," Thompson said. "As soon as we can get into some warmer weather I think we'll be moving in a better direction." Stopping the spread When HPAI is identified in the flock, the standard procedure is to euthanize all the birds in order to prevent the virus from spreading more. The virus is extremely lethal to domesticated birds, and most will die shortly after infections are identified.The standard procedure for “depopulating” a coop is to use a machine that spreads foam over the birds and prevents them from breathing. Thompson said the practice is in accordance with guidelines from the American Veterinary Medical Association.Farmers can take biosecurity measures to prevent their flocks from getting infected. University of Minnesota Extension poultry educator Abby Schuft said federal officials require larger operations to have a biosecurity plan in place that gets audited by state authorities every two years. ADVERTISEMENT "The USDA spent billions of dollars in 2015 with depopulating birds and the recovery of those commercial flocks and they decided they didn't want to do that again,” she explained.Many of the steps to prevent the spread are fairly simple. Wearing clean boots when entering a coop and ensuring hands are clean before handling birds are two central rules. It also helps to make farming spaces unattractive to migratory birds by eliminating puddles and ponds and not leaving feed out in the open. Some who raise chickens in urban areas like to leave grain strewn about their yards to allow their chickens to roam and graze, but this can attract unwanted visitors who may bring infection, Schuft said. Can humans get HPAI? Public health officials closely monitor farmers and crews sent out to eliminate infected flocks for signs of animal to human transmission of the virus, Schuft said. So far there have been no reports of the current H5N1 strain infecting humans.Avian influenza viruses rarely infect humans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Animal to human infections typically happen when humans have unprotected contact with infected birds or virus-contaminated surfaces. It is even rarer for a human infected with avian influenza to spread the virus to another human.Federal agriculture officials say it is not possible to get avian influenza from eating poultry or eggs. The chances of infected poultry entering the food supply are extremely low , as birds are typically destroyed.

Dai et al. Nature https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03843-2 (2021)Simple messages derived from behavioural science have increased the uptake of the seasonal flu vaccine1,2,3,4,5, and early studies from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine rollout have found that this strategy works for recently eligible older adults6 and healthcare workers7. However, it is unknown whether messaging on its own will encourage vaccination against COVID-19 among reluctant populations. In a randomized controlled trial (RCT) five to eight weeks after all adults in the study population (n = 142,428) were eligible for vaccination, we find that the best-performing nudge in previous studies2,6 and seven additional messages—stressing vaccines’ safety, efficacy, minimization of bad outcomes, accessibility (free, no identification required), protection of recipients’ families or widespread adoption—had no detectable effect among people who had not been vaccinated according to state records. This suggests an important boundary condition for nudges that is consistent with a recent result from late in the flu season8. Public health authorities should consider simple messages to encourage vaccination at key inflection points (for example, rollout of paediatric COVID-19 vaccines and full Food and Drug Administration approval for adults), but may see diminishing returns if using them to encourage the more hesitant.After a strong initial push, the rate of COVID-19 vaccinations declined in the USA. Efforts to encourage vaccination have run the gamut from free doughnuts and marijuana to million-dollar lotteries and rare experiences such as driving at a superspeedway. Recently, Dai et al.6 reported promising results from an RCT evaluating another tactic—sending people short messages informed by behavioural science. The appeal of this approach is clear: it is cheap and minimally invasive. It is also well supported by convergent evidence: email messages increased COVID-19 vaccination appointment sign-ups among healthcare workers7, and SMS1,2,3, mail4 and email5 messages have increased seasonal flu vaccinations. Moreover, it has garnered considerable media attention9, with pieces advocating it in The Washington Post, Fortune, The Guardian, U.S. News & World Report and this journal10. Policymakers also took note, as several states implemented SMS campaigns9.The Dai et al. study was conducted early in the COVID-19 vaccine rollout with recently eligible older adults. Although the results show the potential of nudges, it is unknown whether short messages can change motivations in the population that did not get vaccinated immediately. Indeed, Dai et. al. distinguish burden reduction (helping people to follow through on pre-existing intentions) from demand creation (changing intentions), and numerous reviews find limited and mixed evidence on what drives demand11,12,13,14.To test whether these findings generalize beyond the initial stages of COVID-19 vaccination, we evaluated the efficacy of text messages sent by the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) to increase uptake in May and June 2021. The messages included the best-performing ‘ownership’ language from Dai et al. and a related flu study2. This language was supplemented in most conditions with information about safety, efficacy or access, for example. This study offers a strong test of direct messaging because recipients were unvaccinated five to eight weeks after becoming eligible. It is also a realistic test of what a government can and, more importantly, cannot do (for example, craft messages containing false claims and send excessive communications).RIDOH maintains separate databases of individuals who have been vaccinated and tested for COVID-19. Our study population is the difference of these lists (tested but not yet vaccinated) matched through a series of quasi-identifiers and excluding people under 18 when tested (final n = 142,428; see Extended Data Fig. 1 for randomization scheme). The primary outcome was vaccination by the end of the measurement period: 25 May 2021 to 21 June 2021 (one week after the last day of messaging). At time of launch, all Rhode Islanders over 16 had been eligible to get vaccinated since 19 April 2021, and free, walk-in availability was widespread. The study was deemed exempt by RIDOH’s institutional review board. The sample size was dictated by policy goals, as all eligible individuals received messages. A previous study2 with more conditions and a sample size similar to our first iteration detected meaningful effects.We created eight messages (Extended Data Table 1, Supplementary Information section 1) on the basis of behavioural science research on COVID-19 health behaviours and other vaccination contexts. All included ownership language (‘a vaccine is waiting for you’)2,6, a sentiment also appearing in a standalone condition. Other conditions further emphasized safety, access, minimal likelihood of bad outcomes, reduced risk to one’s family, social norms or some combination. All included a link to a state-run page providing vaccination options.Individuals were assigned to receive one of eight messages or no message (control group). We randomly divided the population into three consecutive iterations of 40,000, 39,709 or 78,394, and then into roughly equal groups per day within those weeks. Within these strata, individuals were assigned to receive one of eight messages or no message (control group).To maximize overall vaccinations, in iterations 2 and 3 we used an adaptive design such that the likelihood of assignment to any given message was determined by message performance in the previous iteration, with an 𝜀-bounded Thompson sampler adjusting the probability of assignment to condition over time (Supplementary Information section 2).This study is a block-randomized experiment. All analyses (pre-registration: https://osf.io/pkhae) use either the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel (CMH) test for 9 (condition) × 2 (outcome) × 13 (day) strata tables or a block-specific weighting, which provides unbiased estimates of intent-to-treat effects and randomization-justified variance calculations.No SMS message did substantially better or worse than the control whether vaccination rates were measured one week after the messages were sent or at the end of the study period. Figure 1 illustrates the small size of these differences: the largest positive difference was 0.002 for the ‘preventing bad outcomes’ condition (that is, 2% of control and 2.2% of ‘preventing bad outcomes’ were vaccinated). Furthermore, we see no evidence of differences in vaccination rates (however measured) between the control and an aggregated ‘any message’ condition (estimated difference in proportions vaccinated −0.001, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.004 to 0.001, CMH test, P = 0.27), nor between the arms taken all together (CMH test for 9 × 2 × 13 table, P = 0.12). For demographics, see Extended Data Table 2; for additional analyses see Supplementary Information sections 3–6.Fig. 1: Average treatment effects for the eight experimental conditions overall and proportions vaccinated by day.Top left, the differences in the proportion vaccinated by the end of the study between each message condition and the control or ‘no message’ condition (2% of the control condition was vaccinated within the study period). Top right, the differences in the proportion vaccinated within a week of message sending (1% of the control condition was vaccinated within a week of message sending). The total control condition participation was 11,327. The total size of each arm is shown on the right. All point estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). No adjustment was made for multiple testing as no test cast doubt on the null of no difference. Bottom, proportions vaccinated by 22 June 2021 in each message by the date messages were sent. The grey vertical line shows the proportion vaccinated in the control condition. The 95% confidence intervals for small proportions come from the binomial ensemble method of ref. 17.Full size imageWe find no evidence that a strategy found effective early in the vaccine rollout6,7 increased COVID-19 vaccination among people who remained unvaccinated five or more weeks after becoming eligible. Public health officials—especially those avoiding or legally barred from mandates—may turn to this strategy to increase vaccination rates among the less enthusiastic but will probably see minimal impact. Dai et al. highlighted a promising, valuable and low-cost tool that can help to increase vaccinations; although our result does not contradict theirs, it does bound the reach of such approaches, a possibility one of their co-authors contemplated elsewhere10.One limitation of our study is that the initial recipient list may contain some vaccinated people. Rhode Island residents could get tested at home but vaccinated out of state, and certain sites (for example, Veterans Affairs hospitals) do not need to report individual-level records to the state. Base rates may be inaccurate because of this and other sources of noise (Supplementary Information section 6), although this would not mask treatment effects, as message assignment was random. Another limitation is that race and ethnicity information is incomplete (Extended Data Table 2).The study by Dai et al. differed from ours in several ways, including population age (mean age 70 versus 39), message source (recipients’ health network versus a state agency), sign-up ease (recipients being directed to a sign-up system versus a page providing vaccination options) and vaccination context (appointments were scarce in February 2021 but abundant by May 2021). Although these factors could account for the different outcomes, flu vaccine findings suggest otherwise: similar interventions have shown success among younger populations1, when issued by the state15, and using inconvenient media (mailed letters4), and flu vaccines are comparatively easy to procure. One feature that Dai et al. and many flu vaccine studies do share is that they were conducted early in their respective campaigns, whereas ours was not. Notably, a study of older adults found increased uptake of flu vaccines due to postcard messages in October but not November, December or January8. Taken together, this suggests that nudges help early in vaccination campaigns, but the efficacy decays. Another COVID-19 study recently made public provides further support16.Although we cannot identify the mechanism(s) responsible for decaying efficacy of nudges, the possibilities include novelty effects early on, oversaturation effects later on, different types of hesitancy (logistical barriers versus objections to vaccines), and, especially for COVID-19, increasingly polarized discourse, divergent social norms and differential vaccine knowledge. Future work in public health communication should distinguish these mechanisms to better implement message campaigns. It may also be that short messages effectively encourage those somewhat inclined to vaccinate but cannot move those less inclined, regardless of timing, and with time, the former group shrinks. Despite our null result, nudges may serve foreseeable public health needs (for example, vaccinating children under 5 or promoting boosters) if timed correctly. Indeed, we know of no studies showing reduced vaccinations owing to message campaigns, so they carry little potential harm. However, their ability to move the more reluctant may be limited.Reporting summaryFurther information on experimental design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this paper.

Vaccination data comes from medical providers and pharmacies receiving vaccines supplied by the State of Rhode Island, who are required to participate in the Rhode Island Child and Adult Immunization Registry (RICAIR) through electronic data reporting. Immunization records can be accessed by an individual’s medical provider or by authorized RIDOH users conducting public health surveillance activities including linking vaccination records with the state’s COVID-19 testing or case databases to verify information collected during case investigation. COVID-19 testing data (b) is reported to the state through the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS). Our study population is the difference of lists (a) and (b); the resulting database contained 162,504 unique entries. The study ended one day early after RIDOH received complaints about excessive communication. It is unclear how many complaints were received and how many were specifically about this study; other concurrent outreach efforts included SMS messages about COVID-19 testing and phone calls to older adults encouraging vaccination. Nevertheless, leadership halted all such communications out of concern that people would block crucial emergency messages. The final N for the study is 142,428. A small subset of the initial population (N ≈ 800) had chosen Spanish as their preferred language on testing sign-up forms. While we had initially planned to send this group messages translated into Spanish, an unresolved encoding problem prevented Spanish characters from displaying properly on some cell phones. The project team decided to reintroduce these individuals into the general study population for Iteration 3.Extended Data Table 1 Messages used in the RCT and rationalesFull size tableExtended Data Table 2 Demographics for study populationFull size tableSupplementary informationSupplementary InformationThis file contains Supplementary Information, including Supplementary Figs. 1, 2 and additional references.Reporting SummaryRights and permissionsReprints and permissionsAbout this articleCite this articleRabb, N., Swindal, M., Glick, D. et al.

Photos: Frank and Kay Whatley Poultry owners urged to keep birds indoors and report sick birds North Carolina’s State Veterinarian Mike Martin announced on April 5, 2022, that all North Carolina poultry shows, and public sales will be suspended due to the threat of highly pathogenic avian influenza. This includes all exhibitions, farm tours, shows, sales, flea markets, auction markets, swaps and meets pertaining to poultry and feathered fowl in North Carolina. These activities are suspended until further notice. “This suspension is due to the continued spread of HPAI that has affected commercial and backyard flocks in numerous states, including North Carolina,” said Martin. “We do not make this decision lightly. HPAI is a serious threat to our poultry industry and this is a precaution to help limit the introduction of the virus to backyard and commercial flocks.” North Carolina joins several other states, including Georgia, that have also cancelled or altered poultry events due to HPAI. Poultry owners across the state need to practice strict biosecurity. This includes keeping flocks indoors without access to outside and reporting sick birds to your local veterinarian, the N.C. Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Veterinary Division, 919-707-3250, or the N.C. Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory System 919-733-3986. The warning signs of HPAI include: Reduced energy, decreased appetite, and/or decreased activity Lower egg production and/or soft-shelled or misshapen eggs Swelling of the head, eyelids, comb and wattles Purple discoloration of the wattles, comb and legs Difficulty breathing, runny nares (nose), and/or sneezing Twisting of the head and neck, stumbling, falling down, tremors and/or circling Greenish diarrhea Since March 29, HPAI has been detected at seven commercial poultry facilities in Johnston and Wayne counties. More than 90,000 turkeys and more than 280,000 broilers have been depopulated and composted on-site to prevent further spread of the virus. Additional updates to the current HPAI outbreak will be posted to www.ncagr.gov/avianfluewsroom.htm. This type of HPAI virus is considered a low risk to people according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. There are no cases to date of this strain of HPAI infecting a person. The virus is also not considered a food safety threat and infected birds do not enter the food supply. All properly cooked poultry products are safe to consume.

Visitors may notice a difference in a few of the Tulsa Zoo’s exhibits as the avian influenza virus continues to spread in birds across the nation.At least one case has been reported in Oklahoma, in a wild duck in Payne County, so the Tulsa Zoo is taking extra precautions to ensure that none of the birds in its care get sick.The Eurasian H5 type of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, has forced millions of chickens to be euthanized at farms in other states. The plan to protect the zoo’s birds from HPAI is to use enclosed spaces to limit interaction with wild birds such as geese and ducks. “Most of our birds are indoors typically, and so they are exactly where they’ve always been and they can still be seen by the guests for the most part,” said Joe Barkowski, vice president of animal conservation and science for the Tulsa Zoo.

Symptoms include a decrease in water consumption; lack of energy and appetite; decreased egg production or soft-shelled, misshapen eggs; nasal discharge, coughing, sneezing; lack of coordination; and diarrhea.The zoo is working with state veterinarians to determine when they would be able to reopen some of the bird exhibits. “The state veterinarians here in Oklahoma are the ones that helped guide us about what restrictions should be in place, if they’re eased or if they’re increased,” Barkowski said. “So we’re at that level now where all the birds are considered in safe areas, they’re very contained away from other wild birds, and we’re just waiting for further guidance.” Photos: Tulsa Zoo remains open during COVID-19 pandemic TULSA ZOO Addison Valentine, 10, of Houston, Texas, watches an elephant at the Tulsa Zoo Thursday.

(AP) — Zoos across North America are moving their birds indoors and away from people and wildlife as they try to protect them from the highly contagious and potentially deadly avian influenza.Penguins may be the only birds visitors to many zoos can see right now, because they already are kept inside and usually protected behind glass in their exhibits, making it harder for the bird flu to reach them.Nearly 23 million chickens and turkeys have already been killed across the United States to limit the spread of the virus, and zoos are working hard to prevent any of their birds from meeting the same fate. It would be especially upsetting for zoos to have to kill any of the endangered or threatened species in their care.“It would be extremely devastating,” said Maria Franke, who is the manager of welfare science at Toronto Zoo, which has less than two dozen Loggerhead Shrike songbirds that it’s breeding with the hope of reintroducing them into the wild. “We take amazing care and the welfare and well being of our animals is the utmost importance. There’s a lot of staff that has close connections with the animals that they care for here at the zoo.” Toronto Zoo workers are adding roofs to some outdoor bird exhibits and double-checking the mesh surrounding enclosures to ensure it will keep wild birds out. Birds shed the virus through their droppings and nasal discharge. Experts say it can be spread through contaminated equipment, clothing, boots and vehicles carrying supplies. Research has shown that small birds that squeeze into zoo exhibits or buildings can also spread the flu, and that mice can even track it inside. So far, no outbreaks have been reported at zoos, but there have been wild birds found dead that had the flu. For example, a wild duck that died in a behind-the-scenes area of the Blank Park Zoo in Des Moines, Iowa, after tornadoes last month tested positive, zoo spokesman Ryan Bickel said. Most of the steps zoos are taking are designed to prevent contact between wild birds and zoo animals. In some places, officials are requiring employees to change into clean boots and don protective gear before entering bird areas.When bird flu cases are found in poultry, officials order the entire flock to be killed because the virus is so contagious. However, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has indicated that zoos might be able to avoid that by isolating infected birds and possibly euthanizing a small number of them.Sarah Woodhouse, director of animal health at Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium, said she is optimistic after talking with state and federal regulators.“They all agree that ordering us to depopulate a large part of our collection would be the absolute last-ditch effort. So they’re really interested in working with us to see what we can do to make sure that we’re not going to spread the disease while also being able to take care of our birds and not have to euthanize,” Woodhouse said.Among the precautions zoos are taking is to keep birds in smaller groups so that if a case is found, only a few would be affected. The USDA and state veterinarians would make the final decision about which birds had to be killed. “Euthanasia is really the only way to keep it from spreading,” said Luis Padilla, who is vice president of animal collections at the Saint Louis Zoo. “That’s why we have so many of these very proactive measures in place.”The National Aviary in Pittsburgh — the nation’s largest —- is providing individual health checks for each of its roughly 500 birds. Many already live in large glass enclosures or outdoor habitats where they don’t have direct exposure to wildlife, said Dr. Pilar Fish, the aviary’s senior director of veterinary medicine and zoological advancement.Kansas City Zoo CEO Sean Putney said he’s heard a few complaints from visitors, but most people seem OK with not getting to see some birds. “I think our guests understand that we have what’s in the best interests of the animals in mind when we make these decisions even though they can’t get to see them,” Putney said. Officials emphasize that bird flu doesn’t jeopardize the safety of meat or eggs or represent a significant risk to human health. No infected birds are allowed into the food supply, and properly cooking poultry and eggs kills bacteria and viruses. No human cases have been found in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.___Associated Press Writers David Pitt contributed to this report from Des Moines, Iowa, Lindsay Whitehurst contributed from Salt Lake City, Julie Watson contributed from San Diego, Chris Grygiel contributed from Seattle and Tom Tait contributed from Las Vegas.

But bird viruses do, however, have the potential to do economic damage.By Brooks JohnsonApril 6, 2022 at 11:00AMThe largest avian influenza outbreak since 2015 has affected more than 630,000 birds, mostly turkeys, in Minnesota as of Tuesday. (Rich Beauchesne, Associated Press file/The Minnesota Star Tribune)CommentGiftShareListenMore than 23 million birds in 24 states have been affected by the ongoing bird flu outbreak as the highly contagious virus infects flock after flock.The poultry industry, regulators and politicians have repeatedly assured consumers it is not a food safety issue. No human cases have been reported.Highly transmissible bird viruses do, however, have the potential to do economic damage. The 2015 outbreak caused millions of dollars in losses. That episode caused the death of 50 million birds — including 9 million in Minnesota, the nation's leading turkey producer.As of Wednesday, 21 sites in 11 Minnesota counties have reported infections, affecting more than a million birds, according to the state Board of Animal Health. Other than two backyard poultry operations, all of those have been turkey operations since the first reported infections on March 26."This is an active situation in Minnesota and other states across the country, and it is too early at this point to determine the outbreak's impact on the overall turkey industry," the National Turkey Federation said Tuesday. "To date, turkey losses have not reached the levels experienced in the 2015 outbreak, with approximately 1% of U.S. turkey production affected by avian influenza at this time."Minnesota has more than 660 turkey farms that raise about 40 million birds per year.Jennie-O Turkey Store, based in Willmar, Minn., said the virus has hit several of the Minnesota farms in its supply chain.The brand, owned by Hormel Foods, said in a statement it "has been preparing for this situation and took extensive precautions to protect the health of the turkeys in its supply chain."A U.S. Department of Agriculture emergency response team has been deployed to the state to assist farmers and help prevent further spread.Here are answers to common questions about the outbreak.What is bird flu?Related CoverageHome and GardenShould you be concerned about avian flu at your bird feeders?The H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus — HPAI or simply bird flu — is a respiratory disease spread by a variety of bird species. Wild migratory birds are believed to be the primary source of spread across state lines. The first case of the current outbreak was reported at a commercial turkey farm in Indiana in February.What is the risk to humans?Very minimal. No human cases have been reported in the U.S. so far, though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say "some people may have job-related or recreational exposures to birds that put them at higher risk of infection.""Infected birds shed avian influenza A viruses in their saliva, mucous and feces," the CDC says. "Human infections with bird flu viruses can happen when enough virus gets into a person's eyes, nose or mouth, or is inhaled."The type of avian influenza spreading in the U.S. has infected a total of just 880 people worldwide in the past 25 years, according to the agency.Can it reach the food supply in meat or eggs?Unlikely. And if it did, cooking poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 degrees kills the virus."Avian influenza is not transmissible by eating properly prepared poultry," the USDA says. "The chance of infected poultry or eggs entering the food chain is extremely low because of the rapid onset of symptoms in poultry as well as the safeguards USDA has in place, which include testing of flocks and federal inspection programs."What happens when a flock is infected?Behavior changes and sudden die-off can tip off a farmer that avian influenza has reached their flock. The Minnesota Poultry Testing Laboratory or the University of Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory will test samples, which are then confirmed by the USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa.Birds are quarantined and killed to prevent the virus from spreading, and human movement on and between farms is severely restricted. A six-mile control area around the site of the outbreak is monitored, and at least four weeks pass before barns can be restocked.How are farmers affected financially?The federal government spent $879 million responding to the 2015 outbreak — including $200 million in payments for lost birds, according to a USDA report.The biggest shock to the industry could come from lower demand as consumers avoid poultry and eggs. Further hurting demand, prices for eggs are rising as egg-laying hens are killed in the outbreak, limiting supplies.What about backyard chickens?Backyard poultry owners need to follow biosecurity basics and report illness immediately. The Minnesota Board of Animal Health said it is most important to prevent exposure to wild waterfowl.Neighbors worried about avian flu going unchecked on their block can call the Minnesota Avian Influenza Hotline at 1-833-454-0156.What about wild birds?The CDC says wild birds can be infected without appearing sick, and the following precautions should be taken:Avoid direct contact with wild birds and observe them only from a distance.Avoid contact with poultry that appear ill or have died.Avoid contact with surfaces that appear to be contaminated with feces from wild or domestic birds.Bird feeders pose a low risk of contamination, but extra precautions should be taken and waterfowl should not be fed for the time being.How does this outbreak compare to 2015?The deadliest avian flu outbreak in the United States claimed 50 million turkeys and chickens between December 2014 and June 2015. The majority of the infections occurred between April and May. About 12% of the country's egg-laying hens and 8% of turkeys grown for meat were killed by the virus or culled to prevent its spread, according to the USDA.As the outbreak reaches its third month, the National Turkey Federation says "industry, USDA and state animal health officials are engaged in a coordinated effort to respond quickly to avian influenza incidences in commercial turkey flocks. Growers continue to focus on biosecurity and closely monitoring the health of flocks."Can I help?Report sick or dead birds to the Minnesota Avian Influenza Hotline: 1-833-454-0156.Report sick or dead wild waterfowl or birds in groups of five or more to the Department of Natural Resources: 1-888-646-6367.Flock owners and poultry workers can call the Minnesota Farm and Rural Helpline at 1-833-600-2670 or text FARMSTRESS to 898211.ShareCommentabout the writerBrooks JohnsonFood and Manufacturing ReporterBrooks Johnson is a business reporter covering Minnesota’s food industry, 3M and manufacturing trends.See MoreMore from AgricultureSee MoreAgricultureCHS facing competition for its $200M offer to buy West Central cooperativeBrooks JohnsonAgricultureCHS facing competition for its $200M offer to buy West Central cooperativeBrooks JohnsonMinnesota-based CHS also reported a $1.1 billion annual profit Wednesday.AgricultureFarming is more high-tech than ever.

When cases of bird flu are found on poultry farms officials act quickly to slaughter all the birds in that flock even when it numbers in the millions, but animal welfare groups say their methods are inhumane. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall, File) By JOSH FUNK Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — The spread of a bird flu that is deadly to poultry raises the grisly question of how farms manage to quickly kill and dispose of millions of chickens and turkeys.It’s a chore that farms across the country are increasingly facing as the number of poultry killed in the past two months has climbed to more than 24 million, with outbreaks reported nearly every day. Some farms have had to kill more than 5 million chickens at a single site with a goal of destroying the birds within 24 hours to limit the spread of the disease and prevent animals from suffering.“The faster we can get on site and depopulate the birds that remain on site, the better,” Minnesota State Veterinarian Beth Thompson said.The outbreak is the biggest since 2015, when producers had to kill more than 50 million birds. So far this year, there have been cases in 24 states, with Iowa the hardest hit with about 13 million chickens and turkeys killed. Other states with sizable outbreaks include Minnesota, Wisconsin, South Dakota and Indiana. Farms faced with the need to kill so many birds turn to recommendations by the American Veterinary Medical Association. Even as it has developed methods to kill the poultry quickly, the association acknowledges its techniques “may not guarantee that the deaths the animals face are painless and distress free.” Veterinarians and U.S. Department of Agriculture officials also typically oversee the process. One of the preferred methods is to spray water-based firefighting foam over birds as they roam around the ground inside a barn. That foam kills the animals by cutting off their air supply. When foam won’t work because birds are in cages above the ground or it’s too cold, the USDA recommends sealing up barns and piping carbon dioxide inside, first rendering the birds unconscious and ultimately killing them.If one those methods won’t work because equipment or workers aren’t available, or when the size of a flock is too large, the association said a last resort is a technique called ventilation shutdown. In that scenario, farmers stop airflow into barns, which raises temperatures to levels at which the animals die. The USDA and the veterinary association recommend that farmers add additional heat or carbon dioxide to barns to speed up the process and limit suffering by the animals. Mike Stepien, a spokesman for the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said the techniques are the best options when it’s necessary to quickly kill so many birds. “State animal health officials and producers carefully weigh the different options to determine the best option for humane depopulation and do not make such decisions lightly,” Stepien said.Not everyone agrees.Animal welfare groups argue that all these methods for quickly killing birds are inhumane, though they are particularly opposed to ventilation shutdown, which they note can take hours and is akin to leaving a dog in a hot car. Animal rights groups delivered a petition last year signed by 3,577 people involved in caring for animals, including nearly 1,600 veterinarians, that urged the veterinary association to stop recommending ventilation shutdown as an option. “We have to do better. None of these are acceptable in any way,” said Sara Shields, director of farm animal welfare science at Humane Society International.Opponents of the standard techniques said firefighting foam uses harmful chemicals and it essentially drowns birds, causing chickens and turkeys to suffer convulsions and cardiac arrest as they die. They say carbon dioxide is painful to inhale and detectible by the birds, prompting them to try to flee the gas.Karen Davis, of the nonprofit group United Poultry Concerns, urged the veterinary association to stop recommending all of its three main options.“They’re all ways that I would not choose to die, and I would not choose anybody else to die regardless of what species they belong to,” Davis said. Shields said there are more humane alternatives, such as using nitrogen gas but those options tend to be more expensive and could have logistical challenges. Sam Krouse, vice president of Indiana-based MPS Egg Farms, said farmers feel miserable about using any of the options.“We pour our lives and livelihoods into taking care of those birds, and it’s just devastating when we lose any of those birds,” Krouse said. “Everything that we’re doing every day is focused on keeping the disease out and making sure that we’re keeping our hens as safe as possible.”Officials emphasize that this virus that’s spread primarily through the droppings of infected wild birds doesn’t threaten food safety or represent a significant public health threat. Sick birds aren’t allowed into the food supply and properly cooking poultry and eggs kills any viruses that might be present. And health officials say no human cases of bird flu have been found in the United States during this current outbreak. Once poultry are dead, farmers must quickly dispose of the birds. They usually don’t want to risk the chance of spreading the virus by transporting the carcasses to landfills, so crews typically pile the birds up into huge rows inside barns and combine them with other materials, such as ground up corn stalks and sawdust to create a compost pile. After a couple weeks of decomposition, the carcasses are converted into a material that can be spread on cropland to help fertilize crops. In some cases, carcasses are buried in trenches on the farm or incinerated.

On Thursday, retailers paid between $2.80 and $2.89 for a dozen large grade A white eggs in the Midwest, according to the USDA’s daily Midwest regional egg report. That’s more than double the roughly $1.25 they cost in March, according to data compiled by Brian Earnest, lead protein industry analyst at Cobank, which provides financial services to agribusiness. Typically, large white eggs in that region cost somewhere between $0.70 and $1.10 per dozen, said Earnest, who noted that the Midwest prices serve as a national benchmark. Around Easter, when demand is high, those prices can reach about $2, he said — far lower than they were on Thursday. Wholesale egg prices are spiking Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Higher feed costs and supply chain difficulties have made many food items more expensive this year, and eggs are no exception. But this particular spike is being driven by the highly pathogenic avian influenza that has been detected in flocks across the country, Earnest noted. It’s the worst US outbreak of the bird flu since 2015. Though the flu is deadly for poultry, it is “primarily an animal health issue,” according to the Centers for Disease Control, which added that it believes “the risk to the general public’s health from current H5N1 bird flu viruses is low.” Because the flu is so contagious and deadly to birds, the USDA protocol is to kill infected flocks to curb the spread of the disease. In Iowa, the nation’s leading egg producer, “we currently have more than a dozen sites impacted by the disease,” including three facilities where hens lay eggs, said Chloe Carson, communications director of the Iowa Department of Agriculture. As a result “we have had to depopulate 11.2 million laying hens,” out of about 56 million laying hens in Iowa overall, she said. This particular strain of the flu is being spread by wild migratory birds, Carson explained. The migration season typically lasts from March to May, she noted. “As long as the migration patterns continue, there is a risk for disease to continue to be introduced to our domestic populations,” Carson said. Pricier eggs this summer Although wholesale egg prices are spiking, that doesn’t mean supermarkets are passing those costs onto consumers, explained Earnest. Retailers will often “take a loss on eggs to draw in store traffic,” he said. Generally, around Easter or Christmas, when people are more likely to bake, “we’ll see a reduced price on-shelf for eggs.” So rather than raising prices, some stores appear to be dealing with the higher costs by eliminating their egg promotions. “Retail promotional activity was very limited and offered little incentive for shoppers to buy beyond immediate needs,” according to the USDA’s weekly egg markets overview, published last Friday. Eventually, however, prices are likely to go up. “I would expect we’re going to see at least a 30 or 40 percent premium on top of [typical prices] through the summer months this year as a result of the tighter supply,” Earnest said. He also noted that even before the flu was detected in the US earlier this year, the number of egg-laying hens was relatively low. And frozen or dry egg inventories are “down significantly from what they typically are,” he said. That could mean there will be some egg shortages later this year.

The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed the presence of bird flu in a commercial pheasant flock in Texas. Earlier, APHIS confirmed bird flu infections in Massachusetts, Wyoming, North Carolina, Ohio and North Dakota. So far in 2022, HPAI has also been confirmed in commercial poultry flocks in the following states: Kentucky, Delaware, Maryland, Missouri, Iowa, Wisconsin, South Dakota, Indiana, and Minnesota, according to WATTPoultry.com. APHIS said some 7 million chickens and turkeys were to be slaughtered as a result of the latest outbreaks, Meat + Poultry reported (April 4). The largest outbreak was reported in Osceola, Iowa, affecting more than 5 million commercial layer chickens. Jeff Bender, a professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, said the outbreak could have a significant impact on poultry and egg prices for the next six months if farmers are forced to perform a significant cull. So far, more than 17 million birds have been destroyed. An analysis by CoBank indicates egg supplies are going to be tight at a time of year when they normally are plentiful. Egg prices rose 14% year over year in 2020, partly because of COVID-induced production issues. Currently, the number of egg-laying chickens is down nearly 20 million from April 2019 levels. Consumers may be looking at more than $3 a dozen in coming weeks. Egg prices currently are up 52%, Forbes reported (April 4), and the price of chicken parts also has risen significantly, the USDA National Retail Report-Chicken shows. In other agriculture news: Regenerative grazing: Several groups are trying to convince dairy farmers to try out regenerative grazing to fight pollution and ease the impact on the climate. Agriculture has been cited as the greatest contributor to damage to Chesapeake Bay, for example. Groups like the Dairy Grazing Project argue regenerative grazing can eliminate the need for feed crops and help spread manure more naturally. The technique involves rotating the cows through several pastures to stimulate growth, drawing carbon deeper into the soil. Case studies indicate farms that switched to regenerative grazing reduced their greenhouse gas emissions by 42%, Civil Eats reported. Emotional pigs: Pigs may not be able to fly, but an algorithm developed by European researchers could allow humans to decode porcine emotions, a study published in Scientific Reports found (March 7). Pigs produce more sounds than other animals. The researchers collected 7,400 distinct calls from 411 animals and hope the algorithm will lead to better animal management. Wildfires: Experts warn the 2022 fire season in Northern California could outstrip last year when 2.5 million acres burned, the Sacramento Bee reported. The state is poised to enter its third year of drought, with more than 40% of the state considered extremely parched.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy Agriculture Published April 6, 2022 7:28pm EDT Bird flu outbreak affects over 24 states, poultry prices rise Poultry farmers across the country are on edge as the highly pathogenic avian influenza is on the rise in the US, with more than 24 states impacted since the start of 2022. Facebook Twitter Comments Print Email By Mills Hayes FOXBusiness close video Bird flu outbreak affects over 24 states, poultry prices rise Poultry farmers across the country are on edge as the highly pathogenic avian influenza is on the rise in the U.S., with more than 24 states impacted since the start of 2022. Turkey and chicken already cost more at the grocery store, and prices could get even higher because of a new virus. This time it’s not COVID-19. It’s a highly contagious bird flu that’s spreading across poultry farms, particularly in the Midwest. The average American eats about 100 pounds of chicken per year. And this new virus could cause some shortages. Disease precautions kept Fox Business from visiting these farms in person. It’s rare for people to get infected with avian flu, but it’s a death sentence for birds. Executive director of the Minnesota Animal Board of Health says if one bird is infected in a flock, the whole flock has to go. The Minnesota Turkey Growers Association is watching the outbreak closely. The first reported case was March 25. (Credible)"The poultry that are affected do need to be de-populated. Depopulation stops the virus. We don’t want the farm spreading the virus in the community," Dr. Beth Thompson said. Thompson is also the state veterinarian. So far more than 600,000 chickens and turkeys have been affected in Minnesota. "It’s an extremely large industry. We are the No. 1 turkey producing state in U.S.," Pete Klaphake, President of Minnesota Turkey Research & Promotion Council, said. Chicken prices rise as the bird flu hits poultry farmers. According to Forbes, the cost of eggs has doubled since the outbreak. (Fox News)Klaphake also owns R & L Turkeys. He says his company raises around 30 million pounds of turkey a year. They haven’t had an outbreak yet, but they’re anxiously watching as farmers around them see infections. "If we do have a positive — and we could very easily be the next one — we don’t know how to deal with it," Klaphake said. Clean Chickens and Company is the only mobile chicken processing company in Minnesota. "We basically take a chicken out of the barn and clean it so it’s ready for your table," Chief Operating Officer Greg Wierschke said. Their season is going to look a little different as the flu tears through farms. "Some equipment that we’ve used in the past we’re not bringing with us because we can’t get it as clean as we need to," Wierschke said. "It has to be absolutely sterile, or we’re going to spread it from farm to farm, and we would cause problems." The virus has affected nearly 23 million birds in 24 states, in 90 commercial and 38 backyard flocks in the U.S. The hardest hit states are Minnesota, Maryland, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Nebraska and Iowa. The Agriculture Department pays farmers for birds that must be killed if there is an outbreak, but uncertainty remains. "Scary thing is, as this grows, will that safety net be there all the time? And if it’s not, it’s going to be devastating. It’s going to put a company like ours out of business very fast," Klaphake said. States including Nebraska, Iowa and Minnesota have temporarily banned poultry community sales, swaps, fairs and any other kind of event that brings poultry together to get a handle on this virus. Many state boards of animal health are asking people who own chickens or turkeys to watch out for signs their birds are acting unusually and call a vet or the state if they think one of their birds could be infected. Dr. Thompson says the virus is carried by wild water birds-like ducks, geese and swans. If everyone takes all the right precautions … new cases of the virus are expected to stop when those wild birds migrate in the summer.

(photo credit: PETER NICHOLLS/REUTERS) Egg prices in the US continue to rise as over 11 million egg-laying chickens — about 3% of the total flock in the US - have died or been culled due to an ongoing bird flu outbreak in North America.In total, over 17 million birds have died due to Eurasian H5 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in the outbreak which began earlier this year.Egg prices rose to $2.88 per dozen as of Saturday, about a 52% increase since the first case of the virus was detected in a domesticated flock on February 8 and the highest price since the coronavirus pandemic began in March 2020, according to The Wall Street Journal. A number of countries have temporarily banned imports from US states where bird flu is present, with concerns that top buyers such as Mexico, China and Cuba could import less poultry due to the outbreak, Jim Sumner, president of the USA Poultry & Egg Export Council in Tucker, Georgia, told Bloomberg.The number of egg-laying birds has been low since the beginning of the pandemic. The bird flu outbreak and feed shortages caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine could further threaten egg supplies. Workers in protective gear seen in Moshav Givat Yoav, in northern Israel, December 29, 2021, following an outbreak of the Avian influenza. (credit: MICHAEL GILADI/FLASH90)A report by CoBank, a national cooperative bank serving the industry in rural America, stressed that outbreaks were leading to tens of thousands to over five million birds being culled on each affected farm, adding that "it’s hard to say how many more will be lost."The spike in egg prices comes as the Easter holiday draws closer and demand rises. The threat to egg supplies also comes as the Jewish community prepares to celebrate Passover, a holiday when many recipes require large amounts of eggs. Turkey flocks are also being hit by the bird flu outbreak, with Russ Whitman, senior vice president at market research firm Urner Barry, telling The Wall Street Journal that as turkey supplies are already tight and demand is likely to rise, prices could increase even more. At the moment, turkey breasts are already $4.45 a pound, the highest since the avian influenza outbreak of 2015.The virus has been detected in domesticated flocks in almost half of US states: New Hampshire, Missouri, Nebraska, Maine, Wisconsin, Wyoming, North and South Dakota, Illinois, Kansas, Iowa, Maryland, Delaware, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Ohio, Indiana, Connecticut, New York, Michigan, Kentucky and Virginia.Hundreds of cases of wild birds have been reported in most of those states – Virginia, Maryland, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Delaware, Alabama, Kentucky, Maine, New Jersey, Florida, Massachusetts and Tennessee – in addition to South and North Carolina, and Georgia. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now The first confirmed case of HPAI in a US commercial flock since 2020 was detected in a turkey flock in Indiana earlier this month. The flock was infected with the H5N1 subtype, the same strain detected in mid-January in wild birds in North Carolina when the first American cases of HPAI this season were detected.While the risk to the general public's health is considered low, some people who have job-related or recreational exposure to birds may have a higher risk of infection. The CDC stated that it "is watching this situation closely and taking routine preparedness and prevention measures in case this virus changes to pose a greater human health risk."A large number of bird flu outbreaks have been reported throughout Europe, Africa and Asia in recent weeks and months, mostly due to the H5N1 subtype, which comes from the H5 lineage, according to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The organization warned that a further increase in outbreaks is expected in the coming months.Sign up for the Health & Wellness newsletter >> Related Tags United States eggs Virus Assuta Health bird flu Hot Opinion Dear Jared Kushner, the Jewish people need you By JPOST EDITORIAL To recover, Democrats must expel anti-Zionist extremists who put off Middle America By AMOTZ ASA-EL Leaders of the Jewish enemies have always died as weak cowards By URI PILICHOWSKI How will the recent US election affect Iran, Russia, and North Korea?

By Iowa Capital Dispatch Iowa Capital Dispatch The Iowa Capital Dispatch is a hard-hitting, independent news organization dedicated to connecting Iowans to their state government and its impact on their lives. The Capital Dispatch combines state government coverage with relentless investigative journalism, deep dives into the consequences of policy, political insight, and principled commentary. Successful Farming's Editorial Guidelines Published on April 6, 2022 Close Photo: USDA by Jared Strong Wild ducks that are prominent carriers of a highly contagious avian influenza are migrating through Iowa in their greatest numbers this month, said Adam Janke, a wildlife Extension specialist at Iowa State University. There are about 20 different duck species that number in the hundreds of thousands that travel through Iowa on their way to breeding grounds in the northern United States and Canada, he said. The different species can arrive at different times, but now is when there is the greatest overlap and the most ducks passing through at the same time. "We're reaching a peak for duck migration," said Janke, who studies bird migrations. "We're probably in that area of overlap where there happens to be a lot of species right now." The period of overlap can last for about a month, he said. Ducks, geese, and other waterfowl are well-known carriers of avian influenza and may show no symptoms of infection, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The influenza is often lethal for domestic poultry, including turkeys and chickens that are raised for meat and eggs. Versions of the virus have been identified in 14 commercial and backyard flocks in Iowa since March 1. The two most recent confirmations happened Saturday in a commercial turkey flock of 37,000 in Sac County and a commercial breeding chicken flock of about 15,000 in Humboldt County, said Chloe Carson, a spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship. The total number of birds that have been culled this year because of the virus in Iowa is nearly 13.3 million, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. The death toll of domestic birds from the last major outbreak in the state in 2015 was more than 32 million. Half of the state's virus detections happened in the past week, and Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said recently that the situation could worsen. There have been no documented infections of humans by the wild birds this year, state agriculture officials have said, and the meat and eggs of infected birds are destroyed. Geese have accounted for most of the 25 infected wild birds discovered in Iowa, along with a duck and a red-tailed hawk, the USDA reports. But most migratory geese have already come and gone, Janke said. Those geese often continue north as ponds and lakes thaw, feeding on leftover grain in farm fields as they go. Research has shown that geese that arrive earliest at their northern breeding grounds have a better chance of breeding. There are more than 100 species of wild birds that commonly migrate through Iowa, and "the vast majority are still yet to come," Janke said. Some of those that arrive latest are migrating from South America. The infected waterfowl spend their winters in the southern United States. Nationally, they account for most of the highly pathogenic avian influenza detections in wild birds, but other infected birds have included bald eagles, vultures, hawks, and owls. The virus has been detected in 11 Iowa counties so far. Buena Vista is the only county with multiple detections, and it has four. State ag officials have said their goal is to cull infected flocks within 24 hours of detection to stem the spread of the virus because site-to-site infections were a problem in 2015. They have not found evidence that any of the infected sites so far were the result of transmission from another infected site. Naig has said the threat of infection from wild birds could persist for two more months. The infected flocks in Iowa this year include: March 1: A backyard flock of 42 chickens and ducks in Pottawattamie County. March 6: A commercial flock of about 50,000 turkeys in Buena Vista County. March 10: A commercial flock of about 916,000 egg-laying chickens in Taylor County. March 17: A commercial flock of more than 5.3 million egg-laying chickens in Buena Vista County. March 20: A backyard flock of 11 chickens and ducks in Warren County. March 23: A commercial flock of about 54,000 turkeys in Buena Vista County. March 25: A commercial flock of about 250,000 young hens in Franklin County. March 28: A commercial flock of about 28,000 turkeys in Hamilton County. March 28: A commercial flock of about 1.5 million egg-laying chickens in Guthrie County. March 29: A commercial flock of about 35,500 turkeys in Buena Vista County. March 31: A commercial flock of more than 5 million egg-laying chickens in Osceola County. March 31: A commercial flock of about 88,000 turkeys in Cherokee County. April 2: A commercial flock of about 37,000 turkeys in Sac County. April 2: A commercial flock of about 15,000 breeding chickens in Humboldt County.

Credit: Wyss Institute at Harvard University Human Lung Chip Speeds Drug Discovery for COVID-19 and Flu April 8, 2022 In both the upper alveolar channel (left) and lower blood vessel channel (right) of the Alveolus Chips, the cells formed intact tissues held together by proteins between the cells called ZO1 and VE-cadherin, which are stained red and green, respectively. [Wyss Institute at Harvard University] The lungs’ constant pattern of stretching and relaxing that accompanies breathing does more than allow for basic lung functioning—it generates immune responses against invading viruses. Using a human lung chip that replicates the structures and functions of the alveolus, a research team discovered that applying mechanical forces that mimic breathing motions suppresses influenza virus replication by activating protective innate immune responses. They also identified several drugs that reduced the production of inflammatory cytokines in infected Alveolus Chips, which could be useful in treating excessive inflammation in the lung. Haiqing Bai, PhD, brings his experience studying diseases that affect the human lung’s air sacs, or “alveoli” to his research on organ chips. [Wyss Institute at Harvard University]“This research demonstrates the importance of breathing motions for human lung function, including immune responses to infection, and shows that our Human Alveolus Chip can be used to model these responses in the deep portions of the lung, where infections are often more severe and lead to hospitalization and death,” said Haiqing Bai, PhD, a Wyss technology development fellow at the Institute. “This model can also be used for preclinical drug testing to ensure that candidate drugs actually reduce infection and inflammation in functional human lung tissue.” This study is published in Nature Communications in the paper, “Mechanical control of innate immune responses against viral infection revealed in a human lung alveolus chip.” Bai recreated a flu infection in an Alveolus Chip so that the team could study how these deep lung spaces mount immune responses against viral invaders. Bai and his team first lined the two parallel microfluidic channels of an organ chip with different types of living human cells—alveolar lung cells in the upper channel and lung blood vessel cells in the lower channel—to recreate the interface between human air sacs and their blood-transporting capillaries. To mimic the conditions that alveoli experience in the human lung, the channel lined by alveolar cells was filled with air while the blood vessel channel was perfused with a flowing culture medium containing nutrients that are normally delivered via the blood. The channels were separated by a porous membrane that allowed molecules to flow between them. The Human Alveolus Chip contains hollow side channels that allow suction to be applied to the chips, applying cyclic strain that mimics the motions of normal human breathing (left). A permeable membrane separates human alevolus cells in the upper channel from human blood vessel cells in the lower channel, allowing them to exchange molecular signals (right). [Wyss Institute at Harvard University]When the team infected the Alveolus Chips with H3N2 influenza by introducing the virus into the air channel, they observed the development of several known hallmarks of influenza infection, including the breakdown of junctions between cells, a 25% increase in cell death, and the initiation of cellular repair programs. Infection also led to much higher levels of multiple inflammatory cytokines in the blood vessel channel including type III interferon (IFN-III), a natural defense against viral infection that is also activated in in vivo flu infection studies. In addition, the blood vessel cells of infected chips expressed higher levels of adhesion molecules, which allowed immune cells including B cells, T cells, and monocytes in the perfusion medium to attach to the blood vessel walls to help combat the infection. These results confirmed that the Alveolus Chip was mounting an immune response against H3N2 that recapitulated what happens in the lung of human patients infected with flu virus. The team then carried out the same experiment without mechanical breathing motions. To their surprise, chips exposed to breathing motions ​​had 50% less viral mRNA in their alveolar channels and a significant reduction in inflammatory cytokine levels compared to static chips. Genetic analysis revealed that the mechanical strain had activated molecular pathways related to immune defense and multiple antiviral genes, and these activations were reversed when the cyclical stretching was stopped. These immunofluorescence micrographs (at different magnifications) show the 3D cellular structure that develops within the alveolar channel and mimics the microstructure of human alveoli. [Wyss Institute at Harvard University]“This was our most unexpected finding—that mechanical stresses alone can generate an innate immune response in the lung,” said Longlong Si, PhD, a former Wyss technology development fellow who is now a professor at the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology in China. Knowing that sometimes the lungs experience greater than 5% strain, such as in chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) or when patients are put on mechanical ventilators, the scientists increased the strain to 10% to see what would happen. The higher strain caused an increase in innate immune response genes and processes, including several inflammatory cytokines. “Because the higher strain level resulted in greater cytokine production, it might explain why patients with lung conditions like COPD suffer from chronic inflammation, and why patients who are put on high-volume ventilators sometimes experience ventilator-induced lung injury,” Si explained. The scientists then went a step further, comparing the RNA present in cells within strained vs. static Alveolus Chips to see if they could pinpoint how the breathing motions were generating an immune response. They identified a calcium-binding protein, S100A7, that was not detected in static chips but highly expressed in strained chips, suggesting that its production was induced by mechanical stretching. They also found that increased expression of S100A7 upregulated many other genes involved in the innate immune response, including multiple inflammatory cytokines. S100A7 is one of several related molecules known to bind to a protein on cells’ membranes called the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). RAGE is more highly expressed in the lung than in any other organ in the human body, and has been implicated as a major inflammatory mediator in several lung diseases. The drug azeliragon is a known inhibitor of RAGE, so the scientists perfused azeliragon through the blood vessel channel of strained Alveolus Chips for 48 hours before infecting the chips with H3N2 virus. This pretreatment prevented the cytokine-storm-like response that they had observed in untreated chips. Based on this result, the team then infected strained Alveolus Chips with H3N2 and administered azeliragon at its therapeutic dose two hours after infection. This approach significantly blocked the production of inflammatory cytokines—an effect that was further enhanced when they added the antiviral drug molnupiravir (which was recently approved for patients with COVID-19) to the treatment regimen. These results caught the eye of Cantex Pharmaceuticals, which owns patent rights to azeliragon and was interested in using it to treat inflammatory diseases. Based in part on the Wyss team’s work in Alveolus Chips, Cantex licensed azeliragon for the treatment of COVID-19 and other inflammatory lung diseases in early 2022. Given the drug’s excellent safety record in previous Phase III clinical trials, the company has applied for FDA approval to start a Phase II trial in patients with COVID-19 patients, and plans to follow with additional Phase II trials for other diseases including COPD and steroid-resistant asthma.

Gregory Brown / Missouri Department of Agriculture Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save (The Center Square) – The Minnesota Senate and the House have unanimously passed a $1 million bill in response to the H5N1 avian influenza. The bill now moves to Gov. Tim Walz's desk.The Minnesota Senate on Thursday added the emergency avian flu funding to HF 3217, a bill introduced by Rep. Ginny Klevorn, DFL-Plymouth, that proposes to privatize data identifying farmers who seek assistance with mental or behavioral health issues.The funding for the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI; also categorized as H5N1) response now included in the bill would be spent on testing supplies and other emergency response activities such as disease surveillance, the news release said.“HPAI is an urgent problem for poultry producers in Minnesota,” Rep. Mike Sundin, DFL-Esko, House Agriculture Committee chair, said in a statement. “This is certainly a challenge, but our state Agriculture Department, Board of Animal Health and others are well prepared to respond to the crisis. The investment we’re making today on a bipartisan basis will help keep our state’s poultry industry thriving and protect Minnesota turkeys from Avian Influenza.”The influenza was first detected in Minnesota March 25. It has been found in flocks in 12 counties, and more than 1 million birds have been impacted so far. Minnesota is the top turkey producer in the U.S. It has 660 turkey farms, which raise about 40 million birds annually.“HPAI poses little or no risk to humans, and turkey available for purchase to consumers is safe to eat,” the release said.Gov. Tim Walz announced last week that the U.S. Department of Agriculture emergency response team in Minnesota is supporting the state’s disease control and containment efforts. He made an executive order waiving some trucking regulations to help fight the spread of HPAI and mitigating its risk to the poultry industry. The Minnesota Board of Animal Health has banned poultry sales and exhibitions through May 1.The University of Minnesota Extension encourages bird owners to separate flocks from disease sources, separate new or returning birds from existing flocks for 30 days, clean poultry areas and equipment, and avoid sharing equipment among neighbors.

That makes the efforts taking place inside the Willmar lab more important than ever, as staff work to identify new cases of the disease. Building trustThe Minnesota Poultry Testing Laboratory located in Willmar.Paul Middlestaedt for MPR NewsThe Minnesota Poultry Testing Lab was jointly established by the University of Minnesota’s Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory and the state Board of Animal Health. The lab is located in Kandiyohi County for a reason: it's surrounded by chicken and turkey farms that help make Minnesota one of the top poultry producers in the nation. It's more convenient for area farmers to bring samples here than taking them to St. Paul. And Pollock said being local helps the laboratory staff build trust with farmers and the community.“We see these folks all the time,” she said. “We go to church with them. We go to school with them. We go to basketball games. So the testing that we do here really means a lot.”When the lab was started back in the 1960s, it was much smaller, with just one veterinarian and a couple of technicians. Over the years, it changed locations, added staff and became better equipped. Then, in 2015, came a deadly outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza, which resulted in the death of 9 million birds in Minnesota. After that outbreak, the lab quadrupled in size to allow enough space for PCR testing, in which samples are analyzed for genetic material from viruses and other diseases, including avian influenza.“Along the way, we get little challenges,” Pollock said. “Maybe it's not high-path avian influenza. But we get little hiccups along the way, where we have disease events that we've been able to test ourselves and to work this lab. And it works really well."‘A really, really big thing.’Every day, the lab receives samples, typically an oral or rectal swab taken from a sick bird, or from poultry in a control zone around an infected flock.A lab technician prepares samples inside the molecular lab at the Minnesota Poultry Testing Laboratory.Paul Middlestaedt for MPR NewsLead lab technician Dawn Hennen receives the samples, checks the information to make sure it’s accurate and sends them to the appropriate lab. Hennen has gotten to know many of the poultry farmers who routinely come in. Right now, they're worried, “understandably,” she said."It's their livelihood,” Hennen said. “A lot of them [come from] many generations of farmers. So it's a really, really big thing."In the serology lab, technicians carefully prepare samples, using digitally calibrated instruments to measure tiny quantities of liquid. The test will show whether the turkey has developed antibodies, either from being vaccinated, or recently infected. Dr. Jerry Torrison talks about the PCR machines used for testing samples for viruses on Monday at the Minnesota Poultry Testing Laboratory in Willmar, Minn.Paul Middlestaedt for MPR NewsBut lately, the most high-profile work has been taking place in the newest section of the lab, where PCR testing is conducted. Technicians wearing bright blue gloves process samples inside glass biosafety cabinets. Then, the samples go into machines that extract genetic material. The machines can extract the RNA or DNA of about 90 samples at a time, which takes about 20 to 30 minutes, Pollock said. Then, the samples head to another room for the PCR process, or polymerase chain reaction. A small amount of DNA is copied many times to see if it contains genetic material from a virus or bacteria.Next few weeks ‘critical’Although avian influenza is on everyone’s mind right now, Pollock said they look for a host of diseases that can befall poultry, including virulent Newcastle disease and bacterial infections. The lab staff know that containing the latest avian influenza outbreak is an uphill battle. This week, they confirmed several new cases, and they know more are likely coming.Dr. Saad Gharaibeh.Paul Middlestaedt for MPR News"There's so many waterfowl that are tracking it around all over the country and all over the Midwest,” said Jerry Torrison, director of the university's Veterinary Diagnostic Lab. “And so we're monitoring it very carefully, and are very concerned that it could become a large outbreak."But staff also know that the work they're doing here to quickly identify new cases is critical to slowing the disease's spread."The key thing is early detection, and eradication of those infected flocks or to get them out of the production cycle,” said Saad Gharaibeh, the lab's poultry pathologist. “So the faster you get them out of the production cycle, the lower the risk of contamination."The next few weeks will be critical to determining how widespread the outbreak is, Pollock said."People are going to keep testing,” she said. “They have a lot at risk."

Since just last week, the virus has been found at seven commercial poultry facilities in Johnston and Wayne counties. What You Need To Know Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) has been found at seven N.C. commercial poultry facilities Wild birds are known to spread the virus through their feces This strain of bird flu can kill 75% or more of a flock if it is not controlled N.C. State has a poultry science department as well as a veterinary school and, between the two, theyâre working to help the industry weather the storm that the bird flu is creating. Matt Koci, a professor of viral immunology at N.C. State, said this strain of bird flu can kill 75% or more of a flock, and this virus seems to be more widespread. âWe are always doing surveillance. Usually when we find it, we are able to jump on it real quick and keep it contained to just the first farm that it was found on. Again, this year is unusual that so many wild birds seem to be having it, that brush fires are popping up all over the place, and weâre having to run them down and try and stamp them out as quick as we can,â Koci said. Koci said North Carolina produces a lot of broiler chicken meat so if the bird flu gets worse it could cause shortages or price increases at the grocery store. Backyard chickens are also at risk, and thatâs something Ann Larsen, the owner of Little Birdie Hatchery in Wake Forest, is navigating. Larsenâs chickens are used to being free range, but that hasnât been the case since about February when the bird flu started popping up. âI am hoping and praying by keeping them in the run during the day is still enough to keep them safe,â Larsen said. Wild birds are known to spread the virus, and backyard chickens can catch it if they come into contact with feces from a sick wild bird. âI guess about three weeks ago or four weeks ago there was a hawk found just on the south side of Falls Lake that was diagnosed with the bird flu, so yes itâs getting too close for comfort,â Larsen said. People can also unknowingly spread the virus if they step in the feces and wear the same shoes somewhere else. âWorst-case scenario would be one of mine would catch it, it would be one of the big ones. Yes, I would have to shut down and wait however long the period would be before I could start over,â Larsen said. Bird flu often spreads very quickly and is a painful way for birds to die. Out of precaution, Larsen has temporarily stopped selling chicks, but when she resumes sheâll likely do curbside pickup only in order to limit the risk of exposing her animals. âIt would definitely be a financial issue, and I would have to find something else to do in the meantime, but it's not something I like to think about,â Larsen said. Koci also says this strain of bird flu is not known to affect humans. Courtesy of N.C. State Some warning signs and symptoms of bird flu in chickens include lack of energy and appetite as well as decreased egg production. On Tuesday, State Veterinarian Mike Martin announced that all North Carolina poultry shows and public sales will be suspended due to the threat of HPAI. This includes all exhibitions, farm tours, shows, sales, flea markets, auction markets, swaps and meets pertaining to poultry and feathered fowl in North Carolina. These activities are suspended until further notice. âThis suspension is due to the continued spread of HPAI that has affected commercial and backyard flocks in numerous states, including North Carolina,â Martin said. âWe do not make this decision lightly. HPAI is a serious threat to our poultry industry, and this is a precaution to help limit the introduction of the virus to backyard and commercial flocks.â According to the state, more than 90,000 turkeys and more than 280,000 broilers have been depopulated to prevent further spread of the virus in North Carolina.

Here's what that means for you. (Shutterstock)NEW JERSEY — New Jersey officials are on the lookout after some 23 million birds have been destroyed nationwide to control a highly pathogenic bird flu virus causing disease in commercial and backyard poultry in about half of U.S. states. The bird flu outbreak, first reported in a commercial turkey flock in Indiana and the worst since 2015, is further driving up prices for eggs and chickens, which are already high due to inflation. In New Jersey, 21 birds have tested positive for the flu so far, according to the USDA. All of them were wild Mallards tested out of Cape May. Find out what's happening in Across New Jerseywith free, real-time updates from Patch.SubscribeAccording to a map provided by the National Wildlife Health Center, no commercial or backyard flock in New Jersey has been flagged as infected yet. However, between 2021-22, wild birds in South Jersey were confirmed to have tested positive for the virus, per the map. Several other commercial poultry and wild flocks in Pennsylvania and Delaware have also tested positive during that time frame. Other outbreaks have been reported in New York and Connecticut.Find out what's happening in Across New Jerseywith free, real-time updates from Patch.Subscribe“We know it’s in our populations,” Dr. Nicole Lewis, a pathologist for the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife told Patch, noting that a sampling of 21 positive cases in a single state is "definitely abnormal." New Jersey typically sees one or zero positive bird flu cases a year, she said. Lewis added that this Eurasian strain seen in the Cape May mallards is a particularly contagious one, although the ducks seemed to be asymptomatic. “Waterfowl like ducks are known to be reservoirs for the disease…and susceptible species like poultry pick it up," Lewis said. "Then they affect poultry farms." New Jersey Department of Agriculture spokesman Jeff Wolfe confirmed that the state conducts avian influenza testing at live bird markets and of other domesticated poultry upon request. All New Jersey poultry owners, whether commercial producers or backyard enthusiasts, must report sick or unexplained bird deaths to State/Federal officials immediately. Sick or dead poultry can be reported to the USDA APHIS Veterinary Services NJ Area Office at 609-259-5260 or toll-free at 1-866-536-7593. The outbreak is concentrated mainly in the Eastern and Central United States, but cases have been reported in the Dakotas and Wyoming as the bird flu makes its way west, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said. Among the 24 states with bird flu outbreaks are Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Here are five things to know about bird flu: 1. Eggs And Chickens Are Pricier It’ll cost you more to put them on the table, but eggs and chickens are still safe to eat.For example, the Agriculture Department said the cost of boneless, skinless chicken breasts increased to about $5.11 a pound, compared with $3.41 a pound the previous year. In New Jersey, boneless chicken breasts are $3.94 on average, with some store brands costing consumers over $4. Egg prices are increasing as well. Nationally, they cost about $2.88 a dozen, up 52 percent since the first confirmed case of the bird flu in February, according to the USDA. 2. It’s Safe To Eat Chickens And Eggs, But … The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there is no risk to humans who eat eggs and chickens from infected flocks as long as they’re properly handled and thoroughly cooked. Cooking to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit kills bacteria and viruses, including bird flu viruses. The CDC has long advised against eggs cooked sunny side up or over-easy. And while you should avoid eating meat or eggs from poultry infected with bird flu, the Agriculture Department says there’s little chance infected poultry products will enter the food chain.USDA Inspection Service personnel are assigned to every federally inspected meat, poultry and egg production plant in America as part of the agency’s avian flu response program. “All poultry products for public consumption are inspected for signs of disease both before and after slaughter,” the agency said. “The ‘inspected for wholesomeness by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’ seal ensures the poultry is free from visible signs of disease.” 3. There’s Not Much Risk To Humans The CDC stops short of saying there’s no risk to humans from avian flu viruses. “Based on available epidemiologic and virologic information about these viruses, CDC believes that the risk to the general public’s health from current H5N1 bird flu viruses is low,” the agency said, adding, “however some people may have job-related or recreational exposures to birds that put them at higher risk of infection.”As is the case with all viruses, bird flu can mutate, and the CDC said it is monitoring it for “genetic or epidemiologic changes suggesting they might spread more easily to and between people.” 4. Backyard Chickens Are At Risk Backyard chickens are egg producers, but also pets in many cases. To protect them from the avian flu, the extension service at Minnesota State University advises: Separate your flock from diseases sources, including wild birds and other wildlife. Make sure chicken houses, coops and other areas where chickens spend time are clean. When introducing new birds to your flock, or returning birds to the flock, keep them separated for at least 30 days. Never share chicken handling equipment with neighbors. 5. Wild Birds Spread Avian Flu The current outbreak of avian flu is traced to wild birds that showed no signs of illness but likely carried the disease to new areas during migration, the Agriculture Department said. The agency anticipates additional avian influenza outbreaks in more states as it continues wild bird surveillance into the spring. The surveillance program "provides an early warning system for the introduction and distribution of avian influenza viruses of concern in the United States,” the agency said, allowing it and the poultry industry “to take timely and rapid action to reduce the risk of spread to our poultry industry and other populations of concern.”Get more local news delivered straight to your inbox.

(Photo from Zoo New England) By Rick Sobey | rick.sobey@bostonherald.com | Boston HeraldPUBLISHED: April 6, 2022 at 8:48 PM ESTBird enthusiasts heading to the Franklin Park Zoo won’t be able to see every bird there, as zoo workers have moved many of the bird species inside amid avian flu concerns.Staff at Stoneham’s Stone Zoo have also relocated birds to indoor spaces to protect them from Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) — which, for birds, is highly contagious and poses a serious health risk.The avian flu has been confirmed in states within the eastern flyway, including Massachusetts. Wild waterbirds, such as shorebirds and waterfowl, are most likely to carry the virus.“While it may be disappointing to some guests not to see all of the birds, this is an important preventative safety measure for the health of the birds within our care,” said Eric Baitchman, vice president of Animal Health and Conservation at Zoo New England.The staff at Franklin Park Zoo has moved the cranes, kori bustards, ostriches, emus and free-roaming peacocks to covered spaces, so they are not at risk of coming into contact with wild birds.Aussie Aviary, the enclosed free-flight aviary home to hundreds of colorful budgies, is currently closed to the public, as is the enclosed walk-through aviary within the Children’s Zoo.At Stone Zoo, the whooping crane and black-necked crane were both moved to indoor spaces, and the duck pond was drained to prevent fly-in of wild waterfowl. At both zoos, the birds are being closely monitored by their care teams, and all are currently healthy and well.“We have well-established plans and protocols for this type of situation and are working closely with our state veterinarians and ornithologist at the USDA, the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources and the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife,” Baitchman said. “We appreciate our guests’ understanding of these temporary protective measures,” he added.Related Articles Local News | BOS Nation FC’s ‘Too Many Balls’ campaign leads to apology from club: ‘Missed the mark’ Local News | Boston Mayor Wu extends BPS free museum initiative through 2024, but holds off on expanding it to all city kids Local News | Gaskin: White Stadium plans must focus on local benefits In addition to moving birds to indoor spaces, the staff is taking additional preventative measures — including disinfecting foot baths and enhanced cleaning.The virus is easily tracked on shoes and clothing, so these measures are in place to further protect the birds while they are off exhibit.The USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service recently confirmed the virus in a non-commercial, mixed-species backyard flock in Berkshire County. State officials quarantined the site, and birds from the flock of 240 — including ducks, chicken, geese, quail and turkeys — were safely removed and properly disposed, according to officials. Birds from infected flocks do not enter the food system.The CDC said the recent detections are not an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the U.S.As a general food safety precaution, officials are reminding people that they should cook poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 degrees.

PawlowskiWhen a person feels a “stomach flu” coming on, there’s some misery ahead.But even though the term covers a host of unpleasant symptoms and the illness can be caused by a virus, there’s actually no influenza involved.“It has nothing to do with the flu and in fact, (stomach flu) doesn’t have any medical meaning in the medical world,” Dr. Joseph Vinetz, an infectious disease expert and professor at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, told TODAY.The gastrointestinal distress many people are describing is actually gastroenteritis — in its viral form, the second most common illness in the U.S., according to the National Library of Medicine.Here is what to know about the condition:What is gastroenteritis?It’s an inflammation of the stomach and intestines that can be caused by many different viruses (but not flu viruses), bacteria or parasites.“Everybody gets it. I’ve had it,” Vinetz said, recalling it happened to him during his travels. In those cases, the condition is sometimes called traveler’s diarrhea.Many people know about the condition in the context of the highly-contagious norovirus, which is often behind outbreaks on cruise ships. A norovirus infection is sometimes also referred to as winter vomiting disease because it can be more persistent at low temperatures.The virus is “super stable” in the environment and hard to clean, Vinetz noted. You can catch it by consuming contaminated food or drinks, touching a contaminated surface and then putting fingers in your mouth or having direct contact with someone who is infected, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.When people think they have the stomach flu or a stomach bug, it’s probably norovirus, the agency added. Outbreaks have been on the rise since January: There were 448 norovirus outbreaks reported to the CDC from August 1, 2021 to March 5, 2022, compared to 78 during the same period during the previous seasonal year. Experts told NBC News the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions may be helping the norovirus spread. Bacterial gastroenteritis is less common than the viral kind, with E. coli and salmonella among the culprits. This foodborne illness has been previously linked to outbreaks involving romaine lettuce and bean sprouts, Vinetz said: “You eat it, the bacteria come in, they set up shop and produce these bacterial toxins that cause diarrhea.”What are the symptoms of gastroenteritis?The main symptom of gastroenteritis is diarrhea, which may be accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Patients can also experience stomach pain, fever, headache and body aches.What is the treatment for gastroenteritis?In most cases, there’s no specific treatment other than supporting the body as it gets through the illness over one or two days. Gastroenteritis usually gets better on its own, Vinetz said. The main concern is making sure a patient doesn’t get dehydrated. When people have diarrhea, they lose water, sodium and potassium, which can lead to life-threatening alterations in the salts in their blood, he noted. Patients need more than plain water to replenish the lost minerals. Vinetz recommended a product like Pedialyte because it has a better salt mixture than sports drinks. Chicken soup is also a good option, he added.When people can’t keep down what they drink, they need intravenous fluids. If it’s the bacterial form of gastroenteritis and people become seriously ill, get the bacteria in their bloodstream, have an underlying illness or are immunocompromised, antibiotics may be an option, but they’re reserved for very severe cases, Vinetz said. Could COVID-19 be mistaken for gastroenteritis?COVID-19 symptoms can include diarrhea, nausea or vomiting. But the illness generally doesn’t come just with gastrointestinal issues — there are usually other symptoms such as a sore throat, stuffy nose or cough, Vinetz noted.A person can always take an at-home COVID-19 test to make sure.When to seek help for the 'stomach flu'Unless somebody is extremely sick or immunocompromised, a day or two of symptoms typically doesn’t require testing or treatment — it’s just watching and waiting, plus plenty of fluids, Vinetz said.“The general advice is: If you’re not better after a couple of days, go see a doctor,” he noted. “If you can’t keep anything down or are getting dizzy because you’re getting dehydrated, then you need to see a doctor or go to the emergency room.”How to prevent a norovirus infectionWash your hands with soap and water after going to the bathroom and before preparing food. Clean and disinfect surfaces with a solution that contains five to 25 tablespoons of household bleach per gallon of water, the CDC advised.A. PawlowskiA.

How to know as Omicron cases riseWith very limited access to PCR tests across Canada, some people who are getting sick are wondering if they have COVID, or a cold or the flu — and what they should do if they have COVID symptoms but don't actually feel so bad. No specific symptom — or lack of one — can say for sure it's COVID. You have to testStephanie Hogan · CBC News · Posted: Apr 07, 2022 4:00 AM EDT | Last Updated: April 7, 2022COVID-19 cases on the rise in Canada, but it may be hard to know the difference between a cold or COVID without a test. (PhotoMediaGroup / Shutterstock)Social SharingThis story idea came from audience members, like you, who got in touch with us. Send us all of your questions about COVID-19. We are listening: covid@cbc.ca.The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) says a resurgence of COVID-19 appears to be underway, fuelled by the highly transmissible Omicron variant. At the same time, most COVID restrictions have been lifted across the country, more adults are heading back to workplaces, and kids, for the most part, no longer have to wear masks in schools."As of March 31, daily average case counts have increased by 28 per cent nationally," Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam said during a briefing last week. It seems everyone either knows someone who is sick or they are sick themselves. Two of the doctors who spoke to CBC News for this story recently tested positive. But with limited access to PCR tests across Canada, some who are getting sick are wondering if they have COVID or a cold or the flu — and what they should do if they have COVID-like symptoms but don't actually feel so unwell. We'll answer some of those questions here. WATCH | Why Omicron cases are on the rise and how to blunt transmission: Tam discusses reasons for the resurgence of COVID-19 in parts of Canada3 years agoDuration 1:45Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Theresa Tam says that whenever public health measures are relaxed, a resurgence of COVID-19 cases can be expected. Tam says she encourages people to continue wearing masks to keep the pandemic under control.Is it COVID or just a cold? It's impossible to know for sure whether you have COVID-19 without a test, said Dr. Shazma Mithani, an emergency physician in Edmonton. "There's no specific symptom or lack of symptom that can say for sure it is COVID or not."The current list of possible COVID-19 symptoms in Canada is long – 14 in all. And PHAC warns that symptoms vary from one person to another, and that age can be a factor. Right now, some of the most commonly experienced symptoms of COVID-19 include: Sore throat. Runny nose. Sneezing. New or worsening cough. Fatigue. Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Temperature equal to or more than 38 C. "Many people who have COVID infection feel almost nothing or very mild symptoms — especially if they're young and healthy — versus some people as they start to get into their 40s, 50s and upwards seem to be much more symptomatic," said Dr. Lisa Barrett, an infectious disease doctor and researcher at Dalhousie University in Halifax.And a once telltale sign has all but disappeared. "That loss of taste and smell, which was kind of a warning symptom of, like, this is very likely COVID … that has evolved out of the virus, where it's less prominent now," said Barrett. What doctors say they are seeing more of with Omicron is gastrointestinal symptoms, especially diarrhea, but also vomiting and abdominal pain. Still, the bottom line is that testing is the only way to know for sure whether you have COVID-19. If you have manageable symptoms, like a mild cold, should you still do a COVID-19 test? Doctors say yes. "The purpose of a rapid test is not to tell you you're not infected," said Barrett."The purpose of a rapid test at this point is to tell you, if you do have a positive, that it's highly likely that you have Omicron, or COVID."And knowing that is important for several reasons. "If you're a person at high risk, getting a test would make you eligible for antiviral treatment," said Dr. Kashif Pirzada, an emergency physician in Toronto. He recommends anyone who is elderly, immunocompromised, or who has multiple medical conditions to get a rapid antigen test at the very least, though a PCR would be best. Still, he said a positive rapid test "would put you in line to get these new antiviral medications," including Remdesivir or Paxlovid.Rapid testing is also recommended if you are young or otherwise healthy, for a few reasons.A rapid home test for COVID-19 shows a negative result. (David Horemans/CBC)"In the case of a situation where somebody might be unfortunate enough to develop long COVID, it's important to have that documentation of having had COVID," said Mithani.She said it's also important to know so that you can let anyone you were in close contact with know that they've been exposed to the virus. I've heard rapid tests don't work on Omicron, so what's the use? It's not entirely clear yet why the rapid tests don't seem to pick up Omicron as effectively as they picked up earlier variants.Barrett said it is too early to know whether it is the variant itself that is more difficult to pick up, or whether there is less viral load to detect because people getting sick have some level of immunity from vaccination or previous infection. But there are ways to make the test more effective. First, test more often."Testing every 24 hours while you're symptomatic," said Mithani."For at least for every single day that you're symptomatic, I would test every day if you have access to that number of rapid tests. If not, then you can stretch it out every one to two, or one to three days, just to ration tests a little bit."Second, go beyond your nose."Swab both your throat and your nose to improve the sensitivity or the accuracy of the test," said Mithani.She advises swabbing your throat first, around where your tonsils are and where the uvula is in the middle."Swab it aggressively," she said, "and then swab both of your nostrils."Pirzada said you can swab your cheek, too, in between doing your throat and nose.Doctors say swabbing the throat and cheek, along with the nose, can make rapid COVID-19 tests more effective. Here, a woman is seen having her throat swabbed at a coronavirus testing site in Beijing Wednesday. (Andy Wong/The Associated Press)That said, he points out some rapid tests have been found to perform better than others. And all of the doctors agreed that just because you test negative, that does not mean you don't have COVID."As soon as you develop any cold-like symptoms, that's a sign that you might have it," said Pirzada."The rapid test, even if it's negative, don't take that as gospel, especially right now."Does the colour of nasal discharge indicate whether it is more likely COVID? No. Coloured mucus — green or yellow, and sometimes foul-smelling — often comes from a sinus infection, said Pirzada, which can be bacterial. But he said clear or coloured mucus will not tell you with any certainty whether it is COVID. You need to test. I don't know anyone with the flu — is it still around? Influenza rates remain low for this time of year, according to PHAC's FluWatch report. In fact, it says there has been "no evidence of community circulation of influenza" during the entire 2021-2022 season.Despite doing similar numbers of lab tests for flu, the test positivity rate is "exceptionally low" across Canada, at 0.13 per cent, compared to an average of 23 per cent test positivity for the same period in the past six pre-pandemic seasons. This flu season (which began Aug. 29, 2021) has seen just 551 influenza detections reported, compared to an average of 38,193 by this point in the past six pre-pandemic flu seasons. Doctors provide flu vaccinations to patients in their underground parkade in Vancouver in October 2020. Flu rates have been extremely low across Canada for the 2021-22 season. (Ben Nelms/CBC)Mithani said doctors are seeing cases of influenza in Edmonton hospitals, and if someone high-risk comes in with symptoms and tests negative for COVID-19, they will be tested for influenza. It's much the same in other provinces, too. Pirzada said anyone high risk in Ontario will also be tested for influenza if the COVID PCR test in hospital is negative. "So we are still testing for it, it's just not coming back positive very often," said Pirzada. "Some strains of flu have actually gone extinct since the pandemic started."Young children who present at hospital with COVID-like symptoms will also be tested for flu and other respiratory illnesses, including RSV. If people are masking and being careful, why are they still getting colds or flu? While COVID-19 is primarily airborne, colds and flu spread more on surfaces, too, so Pirzada said it's possible people are catching them that way.The other thing, he said, is children."Children are spreading these viruses with gusto with each other, and they're bringing it home. And then you, if you have children, are spreading it to other people at your workplace."The best way to avoid colds and flu, in addition to continuing to wear a mask, is the age-old advice to wash your hands and not touch your face. Children, such as these seen playing together at Dream Magic daycare in Val-d'Or, Quebec, are a main source of spread of colds and other viruses. (CBC/Radio-Canada)What's the biggest misunderstanding about COVID-19 right now?"The most dangerous one is that COVID living means pretending it's not around," said Barrett. "That if you are somebody who wants to live with COVID, that you have to forget about it and just do what you did before COVID — the same amount of interaction, the same type of interaction without a mask, no testing, no isolation. That is the dangerous misconception."Canada's vaccine advisory body recommends 'rapid deployment' of 4th doses for 80+Quebec extends mask mandate until end of AprilPirzada said it's also important to remember that if you get COVID, it doesn't mean you won't get it again. "Even if if you get sick now ... immunity to COVID is very short, so you could get sick in the next wave in two or three months."He said there needs to be a move to policies that cut down on the amount of circulating virus, "like good ventilation, masking in indoor spaces when there's big waves like this, and the rapid tests." WATCH | Why this doctor says masks are still important: Mask mandates should be extended in Quebec, doctor says3 years agoDuration 6:01Dr. Christopher Labos spoke with CBC News about the pandemic's sixth wave in Quebec, and how he thinks it's best for mask mandates to continue for the time being, to reduce the risk of hospitalizations."The most important thing is what I call the vaccine-plus plan," said Barrett. "Which is get all the [vaccine] doses that you're eligible to get. Wear a mask indoors — it's not perfect, but it's certainly helpful. And then, where available, test and isolate and keep your contact number moderate. You don't have to stay home, but keeping it moderate."She said that if you do go out to a restaurant or other indoor gathering without wearing a mask, try to avoid seeing vulnerable people for three days after to make sure you don't develop symptoms. And if you need to interact with someone who is high risk, distance, wear a mask and practise good hand hygiene.

Ruzzon on Unsplash The Heart of the South West Trading Standards Service is reminding all keepers of poultry that they are legally required to take measures to reduce the risk of bird flu spreading. On Wednesday (April 6) avian influenza (H5N1) was confirmed in a bird at a premises near Newton St Cyres, Mid Devon, and another case is suspected at a premises near Tedburn St Mary, Teignbridge. All birds on both premises were due to be humanely culled. A 3km protection zone and 10km surveillance zone has been placed around the Newton St Cyres premises and a 3km Temporary Control Zone and 10km Temporary Control Zone was placed around Tedburn St Mary premises. An Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) came into force across Great Britain last November. This means all bird keepers, regardless of whether they are pet birds, a commercial flock or just a few birds in a backyard, must keep their birds indoors and keep a close watch on them for signs of disease. Bird flu is a notifiable animal disease. If you suspect any type of avian influenza in poultry or captive birds, you must report it by calling the Defra Rural Services Helpline on 03000 200 301. If you find dead wild swans, geese or ducks or other dead wild birds, such as gulls or birds of prey, you should report them to the Defra helpline (03459 33 55 77). Do not touch or pick up any dead or visibly sick birds that you find. For further information go to Defra’s advice to the public page. All bird keepers must follow strict biosecurity measures which include: Disinfecting all vehicles which have been transporting poultry and disinfecting all crates, containers, plastic egg trays and other equipment before and after use.Keep farm access routes, parking areas, yards, areas around buildings and storage areas clean and tidy and well maintained,Keep all poultry houses or sheds well maintained to ensure that wild birds do not nest or roost in them.Keep wild birds, dogs, cats, rodents, and other livestock out of poultry buildings and feed stores. Matthew Fogaty Lead Officer for Animal Health and Welfare at Heart of the South West Trading Standards Service, said: “Whether you keep just a few birds or thousands, poultry keepers are legally required to meet the enhanced biosecurity procedures to protect their birds from this highly infectious virus.“We are responsible for enforcement of these legal requirements and our officers are working hard to help and advise poultry keepers. We recommend all poultry keepers sign up to the Defra poultry register and the disease alert service where they will receive regular text updates.” You can sign up to Defra’s alerts service.

Photo courtesy Government of Saskatchewan REGINA — Samples collected from a snow goose found near Elrose have been confirmed positive for HPAI by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. The Ministry of Agriculture is reminding poultry producers with flocks of all sizes to follow all necessary biosecurity protocols to keep their flocks free of diseases after a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5 strain was detected in a wild bird in Saskatchewan. The confirmation of the strain in the Saskatchewan bird follows the detection of HPAI in poultry and wild birds in the United States and in several Canadian provinces. The last time HPAI was found in Saskatchewan in either commercial poultry or wild birds was in 2007. Protecting commercial flocks includes preventative measures such as keeping wild birds away from poultry flocks and their food and water supply, limiting visitors, and monitoring bird health. Producers should contact their veterinarian immediately if they have concerns about the health status of their flocks. If HPAI is suspected, producers should also contact their local Canadian Food Inspection Agency office. Small flocks are considered high-risk for HPAI infection as they are most often raised in an extensive fashion e.g. allowed access to outdoor pens or free-range. This means there is a high probability of contact with wild birds or environments visited by wild birds that may be contaminated with HPAI virus. Small flock owners are encouraged to confine their birds indoors if at all possible during this high-risk period of wild bird migration, and follow the same measures indicated for commercial flocks. Typically, strains of avian flu do not cause obvious signs of disease in wild birds. However, this H5 strain has resulted in deaths in some species of wild birds, including snow geese and Canada geese, as well as some raptors. As migratory birds make their way back to Saskatchewan, please report any sick or dead birds to the Ministry of Environment to assist with monitoring efforts. If you find any of the following, please contact the Inquiry Centre at 1-800-567-4224 or [email protected]: Clusters of two or more dead waterfowl (e.g. ducks, geese) or other water birds. Dead raptors or avian scavengers (e.g. ravens, crows, gulls). Raptors, waterfowl or avian scavengers that appear to be sick. Large groups of dead birds (e.g. more than 50) of any species. Reports can also be made to the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative at 306-966-5815 or cwhc.wildlifesubmisisons.org. Although the risk of transmission to humans is considered low, people should not touch dead birds or other wildlife with their bare hands. Protective eyewear and masks are recommended as an additional precaution. Hands should be thoroughly washed before and after with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Birds should be placed in a plastic bag prior to submission. This strain of HPAI does not pose a food safety risk. Regular food safety and hygiene precautions should be followed when preparing wild game. Hunters should avoid eating birds that are visibly ill. Anyone with further questions on avian influenza in poultry can contact the Ministry of Agriculture's Veterinary Unit at 1-306-787-2150. Tags: See a typo/mistake? Have a storyip?

French poultry farmers are expected to suffer heavy losses after a second wave of highly pathogenic avian influenza hit the country.

The French government, as well as poultry industry stakeholders, have expressed concern about the spread of the disease in that country’s largest poultry-producing regions. The current outbreak could result in the devastation of poultry flocks, potential trade restrictions, and the risk of transmission to humans, Reuters reported. - Advertisement - Spread by migrating wild birds during autumn in the Northern Hemisphere last year, almost all countries in the EU were affected by these outbreaks, except for Malta and Cyprus, with Italy suffering the most severe damage. According to data from the Word Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the outbreaks had mostly subsided in these countries by the end of March, as was usual during spring. However, the renewed outbreaks in France were being ascribed to wild birds migrating back to the region, and this was the first time cases had been observed in such significant numbers. The first wave of the disease resulted in the culling of about four million birds in the southwestern region of France. “This situation is dramatic for farmers and will lead to a reduction in slaughtering activity or even the temporary shutdown of certain sites,” according to a statement by France’s LDC. S.A, the EU’s largest poultry producer. The company would be halting production at four abattoirs, which processed a total of 1,1 million birds every week, for up to eight weeks, Gilles Huttepain, former LDC chairperson and vice-chairperson of French poultry lobby Anvol, told Reuters. However, volumes would be supplemented by increasing output at other sites, he said. Meanwhile, rising numbers of HPAI in the US were expected to result in egg shortages this Easter. Reuters reported that egg production had not fully recovered from disruptions that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic, and while supply had since stabilised, it was still well below pre-pandemic numbers. “US egg producers have been hard-pressed to align supplies with market demand over the last two years,” said Brian Earnest, lead animal protein economist at CoBank Knowledge Exchange. “The US layer flock typically expands ahead of the surge in demand for Easter and contracts during the summer months. But recent losses due to HPAI, combined with high feed costs and other challenges, are severely limiting flock size management.” Previous articleJohn Deere’s flexible financing solutionsNext articleThe game-changing passion fruit cultivar developed in SA Elizabeth Schroeder MORE FROM FARMER’S WEEKLY First-ever bird flu case in pigs raises concern in the US Worst year since 2007 for US maize farmers Can automation alleviate labour shortages on US farms?
