Flu Season and Pediatric Deaths: More than 100 children have died of the flu this season, with 10 new pediatric deaths reported recently. The number of pediatric deaths is a reminder that the flu can be severe even in previously healthy children. 

Misconceptions about Flu Severity: Many families mistakenly believe that the flu is just another cold virus and not a serious illness. However, healthcare professionals have witnessed critically ill children and even deaths due to the flu. 

Flu Vaccine Coverage: Nearly 90% of the children who died from the flu this year were not fully vaccinated. Vaccination is particularly important for children, with younger children requiring two doses if they have never received the flu shot before. 

Immune Response and Severity: The severity of flu symptoms is determined by the body's immune response, which can sometimes go too far and lead to complications. Influenza can trigger excessive immune reactions and cytokine storms, causing severe symptoms and potentially landing children in the ICU. 

Ongoing Flu Season: Although flu cases seem to be peaking, flu season is not over, and the CDC estimates that there have been at least 28 million flu illnesses and 310,000 hospitalizations so far this year.
