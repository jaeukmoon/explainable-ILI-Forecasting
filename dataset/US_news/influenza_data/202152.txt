Although continuous human-to-human transmission has not been reported, the occurrence of various H7N9-associated epidemics and the lack of production of strong antibodies against H7N9 in humans warn of the potential for H7N9 to become a new pandemic. Therefore, the need for effective vaccination against H7N9 as a life-threatening viral pathogen has become a major concern. The current study reports the design of a multi-epitope vaccine against Hemagglutinin (HA) and Neuraminidase (NA) proteins of H7N9 Influenza A virus by prediction of Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL), Helper T lymphocyte (HTL), IFN-γ and B-cell epitopes. Human β-defensin-3 (HβD-3) and pan HLA DR-binding epitope (PADRE) sequence were considered as adjuvant. EAAAK, AAY, GPGPG, HEYGAEALERAG, KK and RVRR linkers were used as a connector for epitopes. The final construct contained 777 amino acids that are expected to be a recombinant protein of about ~ 86.38 kDa with antigenic and non-allergenic properties after expression. Modeled protein analysis based on the tertiary structure validation, docking studies, and molecular dynamics simulations results like Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), Gyration, Root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) and Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) showed that this protein has a stable construct and capable of being in interaction with Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), TLR8 and m826 antibody. Analysis of the obtained data the demonstrates that suggested vaccine has the potential to induce the immune response by stimulating T and Bcells, and may be utilizable for prevention purposes against Avian Influenza A (H7N9).

The new Asian lineage avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus has a higher infection risk for humans1. Since then, H7N9 infections have continued to occur during five waves of epidemics. The virus has caused increased mortality in any epidemic periodic by causing acute respiratory distress syndrome, especially in the elderly2,3. Influenza A virus (IAV) is a negative single-strand RNA (ssRNA) virus that belongs to the family Orthomyxoviridae. Eight gene segments include HA, NA, Nuclear export protein (NEP), Matrix protein 2 (M2), Nucleocapsid protein (NP), Polymerase PA (PA), Polymerase PB1 (PB1) and Polymerase PB2 (PB2) in the genome, approximately 13,000 bp of IAVs, are responsible for encoding about 17 different types of proteins4,5. Studies have shown that the H7N9 influenza virus originated probably from the reassortment gene so that its surface genes such as HA and NA related to migratory birds and other internal six genes come from H9N2 avian influenza6. In general, gene reassortment, mutation, and recombination are considered as evolution mechanisms in the RNA viruses such as influenza which distinguishes between different strains of influenza7,8,9. HA glycoprotein antigen is known as one of the H7N9 major envelope proteins that are divided into two subunits of HA1 and HA2. Continuous mutations over time have resulted in extensive changes in HA proteins, resulting in all classified influenza strains in two phylogenetic-mediate major groups and six clades: Group 1 [H1 clade (H1, H2, H5 and H6); H9 clade (H8, H9 and H12); H11 clade (H11, H13, H16; and Bat Has clade (H17, and H18)] and Group 2 [(H3 clade (H3, H4 and H14) and H7 clade (H7, H10 and H15)]10. The HA1 subunit is used as a major factor in inducing immune responses in traditional vaccines; however, the presence of continuous mutations due to immune pressure in the HA1 subunit leads to a lack of cross-immune protection in the use of traditional vaccines for new strains11,12. In contrast, the HA2 subunit is known to be conserved in various strains of influenza as stem-located, furthermore, the HA2 subunit provides the neutralizing and protective antibodies against conformational epitopes and linear epitopes13,14. HA also mediates binding to sialic acid receptors and induces entry into host cells. HA, as the main influenza antigen is a key factor in the host-induced immune response15. NA is one of the other major envelope proteins. It has been shown that NA can secrete sialic acid in the form of enzymatic activity, thereby helping to release the virus16. Studies have shown that several mutations that alter the amino acid profile of HA can increase the binding affinity of HA to the sialic receptor in humans, thereby making the virus more susceptible to infection in humans17,18,19.Using vaccination as a strategy to combat infections with potential epidemic and pandemic potential has led to significant advances in the combat against many of these infectious diseases, such as influenza20. Outbreaks appear to be exacerbated by influenza H7N9 strains, and the importance of rapid and effective influenza vaccines over existing vaccines21. To date, several vaccines have been developed against H7N922,23,24,25. Subunit vaccines are very safe, specific, and rarely have post-vaccination side effects. Today, with the advancement of molecular techniques, the production of recombinant proteins has been made possible. This may help to produce a chimeric vaccine containing several virulence factors pathogenic because multicomponent subunit vaccines can elicit a more protective and efficient immune response than a single component vaccine26. The design and evaluation of immunogenicity of a candidate subunit vaccine are performed experimentally using laboratory techniques that are often time-consuming, costly and of low success rates27. Using bioinformatics software is a very viable and justifiable solution to help design and develop drugs and vaccines. Nowadays, in comparison with laboratory methods using predictable and reliable virtual methods for predicting B and T cell epitopes and MHC stimulation reduces the cost, time and risk of experiments. These methods have the following criteria: applicable to each host, the release of immunity at different sites of infection across different methods of application, and protection against different influenza28.Due to the key role of HA and NA in host attachment and pathogenicity and since HA and NA are considered to the determination of the Influenza subtype, we used them as major antigens for designing of H7N9 influenza vaccine. Besides, HA and NA proteins were targeted to induce strong T cell responses specific for Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and Helper T lymphocytes (HTL). Here, we report an effective insilico design strategy for making a recombinant vaccine. For this purpose, we analyzed the A/Shanghai/2/2013 influenza H7N9 strain sequence isolated from China. Suitable CTLs and HTLs epitopes, with the ability to elicit B cell lymphocyte (BCL) responses against HA and NA proteins, were selected, and the vaccine construct with appropriate linkers and two adjuvants were designed to increase the induction of cellular immunity.ResultsPhylogenetic evolution and Protein sequences retrievalEvolution relationships of NA and HA antigens selected from A/Shanghai/2/2013 show that they belong to the Eurasian strain of avian influenza viruses and are closely related to H7N9 subtypes spread to Europe and the United States. HA antigen of A/Shanghai/2/2013 can be seen in a common clade with avian-derived H7N9 (Fig. 1). Besides, HA shows a closer relationship with the 2013 and 2014 subtypes. But it still has a common ancestor with other H7N9s. In the same vein, NA antigen is also found in a clade with several human-derived H7N9s and avian-derived H7N9s (Fig. 2).Figure 1HA circular phylogenetic tree. The amino acid sequence of HA (A/Shanghai/2/2013 H7N9) was evaluated with other 642 (H7N9) HA amino acid-based on NCBI Influenza Virus Resource. The tree scale was considered equal to 0.1. All H7N9 HA proteins are related to human-derived, avian-derived and environment-derived. Spread H7N9 HA in the Americas, Europe and Asia are shown in blue, green and pink line, respectively.

The amino acid sequence of NA (A/Shanghai/2/2013 H7N9) was evaluated with other 620 (H7N9) NA amino acid-based on NCBI Influenza Virus Resource. The tree scale was considered equal to 0.1. All H7N9 NA proteins are related to human-derived, avian-derived and environment-derived. Spread H7N9 HA in the Americas, Europe and Asia are shown in blue, green and pink line, respectively. NA protein of A/Shanghai/2/2013 H7N9 has been magnified and specified in an orange dashed-line box.Full size imageHA and NA proteins of H7N9 influenza were investigated through categorized population frequently and as shown in Fig. 3a and c, it has spread in three continents of Asia, Europe and America. HA of H7N9 influenza is 100% avian-derived in Europe and Canada, while 3% environment-derived of H7N9 influenza was observed in the USA. H7N9 influenza was 16% human-derived in china, as well as 80% and 4% avian-derived and environment-derived, respectively. NA protein showed 100% avian- derived in both Europe and America. Similar to HA protein, NA protein in China was 80% avian-derived while 17% was human-derived.Figure 3Chart frequency of HA and NA proteins from H7N9 Influenza. Frequency of H7N9 influenza HA protein, separately by country (a) and as a whole (b). Frequency of H7N9 influenza NA protein, separately by country (c) and as a whole (d). Human-derived, environment-derived and avian-derived H7N9 influenza (based on HA and NA protein) are shown in purple, yellow and blue, respectively.Full size imageIt was clarified that more than 81% to been avian-derived among 761 HA proteins of H7N9 influenza, while less than 15% were human-derived and the rest were environment-derived (Fig. 3b). Also, 741 NA proteins of H7N9 influenza showed similar percent so that more than 81% were related to avian-derived and less than 16% were estimated to human-derived (Fig. 3d).Linear and conformational B cell epitopes predictionB cell epitopes are an important component of the H7N9vac because of their ability to induce humoral immunity. Both linear and discontinuous B cell epitopes in the final construct were predicted by the BepiPred 2.0 and iBCE-EL servers, respectively. A total of 27 linear B cell epitopes were extracted from the final construct and shown in Table 1. Conformational B cell epitopes from HA and NA are summarized in supplementary Table S1. Each of the 8 predicted scores for conformational B cell epitopes was visualized in supplementary Fig. S1.Table 1 Liner B-cell epitopes predicted from HA and NA antigens.Full size tableSelection of CTL epitopes predictionThe NetMHC4 server was used for HA and NA MHC class I prediction. MHC-I epitopes were selected based on the highest immunogenicity and antigenicity. Furthermore, MHC-I epitopes were considered with a strong binding score based on the NetMHC4 server rating. Selected MHC-I epitopes that had overlapped with each other were merged and finally 13 MHC I epitopes, including 8 HA epitopes and 5 NA epitopes were utilized at influenza construct (Table 2). All predicted CTL epitopes (binding to MHC-I) are included in Supplementary Table S2.Table 2 CLT epitopes prediction by NetMHC4 server. HA and NA epitopes were selected based on MHC-I HLAs binding affinity (nM), %rank and antigenicity rate.Full size tableTAP transport/proteasomal cleavageDue to the importance of TAP transport and Proteasomal cleavage in the antigen presentation pathway binding affinity, HA and NA antigens were examined via the NetCTL1.2 servers. The scores associated with tap transport and Proteasomal cleavage for each of the CTL epitopes shown in Table 2 are shown. The most immunogenic CTL epitopes were used for this section.Selection of HTL epitopes predictionHA and NA antigens were submitted in NetMHCII—2.3 to predict the binding of peptides to MHC class II alleles. All MHC class II epitopes were analyzed and epitopes were selected which show the highest immunogenicity and antigenicity with the stronger binding score. MHC class II epitopes that had showing overlap were considered independent epitopes. All MHC class II epitopes were analyzed based on inducing of IFN-γ and were included in the final construct. A total of 5 MHC class II epitopes including 3 HA and 2 NA epitopes were selected for the construction of the H7N9-Vaccine (H7N9vac) (Table 3). All predicted HTL epitopes (binding to MHC-II) are included in Supplementary Table S3.Table 3 HTL epitopes prediction by NetMHCII 2.3 server.Full size tablePopulation coverageIEDB population coverage tool in http:/ools.iedb.org/population was used to determine the coverage rate of the population for any selected epitope. As can be seen in Fig. 4, the highest population coverage is observed in combined Class I and II, given that the HA and NA antigens associated with the A Shanghai/2/2013 antigen originate from China in Asia. Detailed Class I, Class II and combined Class I and II epitopes population coverage related to continents are summarized in Supplementary Table S4 and Supplementary Fig. S2.Figure 4Population coverage (%) related to selected epitopes HLA binding alleles. A worldwide and an average percentage of population coverage is considered for all selected epitopes. MHC class I and MHC class II and combined MHC class I and MHC class II are shown in blue, yellow and purple color, respectively.Full size imageConstruction design and physicochemical propertiesFinal selected epitopes were linked by linkers so that AAY linkers were selected for linking of MHC-I epitopes as well as GPGPG linkers for linking of MHC-II epitopes. HβD-3 and PADRE sequence as adjuvants were linked by EAAAK linkers in the N-terminal site. The last MHC-I epitope was linked to the first MHC-II epitope via the HEYGAEALERAG linker. KK linkers also were used to bind B-cell epitopes. A “Histidine Tag” was considered in the C-terminal and linked to the final construct through the RVRR linker (Fig. 5a).Figure 5(a) Representation of H7N9vac construct schematic including linkers, adjuvants, CTL and HTL epitopes. EAAAK linkers connect the adjuvants, AAY linkers connect CTL epitopes, HEYGAEALERAG linker connects last CTL epitope to first HTL epitope, GPGPG linkers connect HTL epitope and RVRR linker connects Histidine-Tag to final construct.

Theoretical pI and instability index (II) were estimated equal to 9.80 and 34.65, respectively, that it grouped Influenza vaccine in stable proteins. Furthermore, the influenza vaccine is expected to have a half-life of 10–30 h in the various prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts. The grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) was computed to be − 0.834, as well as an Aliphatic index of 56.26 (Table 4). The predicted secondary structure of the final construct is presented in Supplementary Fig. S3.Table 4 Physicochemical and immunological properties of the final construct.Full size tableThe possibility of disulfide bonds was investigated by the DiANNA server and it was found that the disulfide bonds have been stabilized between 17Cys-Cys168, 24Cys-Cys630, 29Cys-Cys46, 39Cys-Cys359, 47Cys-Cys374, 142Cys-Cys280, 205Cys-Cys628, 343Cys-Cys417 and 355Cys-Cys717 amino acids.Modeling of 3D construct, refinement and validationRoseTTAFold server was used to model H7N9vac 3D structure (Fig. 5b). Next step, the achieved H7N9vac 3D structure submitted to the GalaxyRefine server. The predicted model validation was performed by online software PROCHECK, PROSA. As shown in Fig. 5c, the Z-Score point was set to − 9.29 after refinement. The Z-Score point is used to validate the modeled protein based on the NMR or X-ray methods. The NMR method is used for the crystallography of proteins with fewer than 200 amino acids and the X-ray method for proteins with more than 200 amino acids. If the Z-Score dot in the PROSA graph is located on the (blue–blue) NMR and (pale-blue) X-ray regions, the simulation accuracy is the highest and the simulated model has the lowest error rate with the highest confidence. Local model quality related to structure is shown in Fig. 5d.Model analysis of the predicted model after drawing the Ramachandran graph revealed that 92.4% (714/773) of all residues were in favored (98%) regions. Overall, approximately 97.8% (756/773) of all residues were in allowed (> 99.8%) regions. In the Ramachandran graph, amino acids are grouped according to the angles of phi and psi (Fig. 5e).Insilico cloning and vaccine optimizationCodon Adaptation Tool (JCAT) was used for the optimization of nucleotide sequences of the final construct. E. coli K12 was selected as a host expression organism. Also, we adjust the properties of JCAT to avoid rho-independent transcription terminators, avoid prokaryotic ribosome binding sites and avoid cleavage sites of restriction enzymes. Codon Adaptation Index-Value (CAI -Value) and GC-Content of the improved Influenza construct with 2310 nucleotide sequence (without His-Tag) were 1.0 and 54.20, respectively, which confirms the probability of appropriate protein expression. Nde I and Xho I restriction enzymes was added to the N-terminal and C-terminal of nucleotide sequence, respectively, so that the PelB sequence is removed from the final structure for achieving an intracellular expression. Furthermore, a stop codon was considered after His-Tag sequence. Finally, the construct was cloned in pET-26b(+) plasmid by SnapGene (Fig. 6).Figure 6Insilico cloning of H7N9 nucleotide sequence insertion in pET26b(+) by SnapGene. The H7N9 nucleotide sequence is shown as the blue line. NdeI and XhoI restriction enzymes are represented in the N-terminal and C-terminal of the H7N9 construct, respectively. Considered His-Tag is shown as a purple box in C-terminal pET26b(+).Full size imageNucleotide sequence of H7N9-Vac along with Open reading frames of protein expression are included in Supplementary Table S5 and Supplementary Fig. S4, respectively.Protein–protein dockingDocking results showed H7N9vac can form interaction with TLR7, TLR8 and m826 antibody 3D structures. We selected and included two PADRE and HβD-3 sequences as the adjuvant in the N-terminal of the final construct. As shown in Figs. 7a and 8a, initial areas amino acids of the H7N9vac were involved with TLR7 and TLR8. Furthermore, the H7N9vac directly formed interaction with several amino acids of TLR7 and TLR8 binding sites.Figure 7(a) Visualization of docking HADDOCK results for H7N9vac-TLR7 complex and (b) magnified residues interaction of H7N9vac-TLR7 complex.

Hydrogen bonds are shown as the green dashed line and salt bridges are shown as the red dashed line.Full size imageThe H7N9vac was also able to interact with both the heavy and light chains of the m826 antibody (Figs. 9a and 10a). HCDR1, HCDR2 and HCDR3 loops from the heavy chain and LCDR1, LCDR2 and LCDR3 loops from the light chain were selected from the m826 antibody to bind to specific regions of the HA antigen in H7N9vac. As shown in Fig. 9a and b as well as Fig. 10a, and b, the interaction was established between the amino acids His94, Gly89 and Lys496 from H7N9vac with the amino acids Ser31, Thr57, Ala58 and Asn59 heavy chain m826 antibody. The amino acids Lys378, Glu382, Glu383, Glu335, Arg336 and Glu332 from H7N9vac also are interacted with the amino acids Ser35, Ser32, Tyr33, Arg97 and Thr95 from the m826 antibody light chain.Figure 9(a) Visualization of docking HADDOCK results for H7N9vac-m826 Heavy chain complex and (b) magnified residues interaction of H7N9vac-m826 Heavy chain complex.

H7N9v structure is shown as the carton and sticks in copper color. TLR8 structure is shown as the carton and sticks in cyan color. Hydrogen bonds are shown as the green dashed line.Full size imageThe H7N9vac’s structure and TLR7, TLR8 and m826 were submitted to the HADDOCK server for identifying the interaction reigns by protein–protein docking, respectively. The highest rankings for each complex were selected at the lowest intermolecular binding of the whole-molecular H7N9vac-Proteins complexes from the HADDOCK with the lowest mean RMSD (Table 5). As shown in Fig. 7b, the H7N9-vac interacted with TLR7 via 6 hydrogen bands. Besides, further investigations of HADDOCK server output show that electrostatic bonds also play an important role in the interactions generated in the H7N9vac-TLR7 complex. In this regard, in the H7N9vac-TLR8 complex, 3 hydrogen bonds and 4 salt bridges are responsible for creating interactions between the H7N9vac and TLR8, just as electrostatic bonds play a major role in the interactions of this complex (Fig. 8b).Table 5 HADDOCK clusters results related to H7N9vac-TLR7, H7N9vac-TLR8, H7N9vac-m826 Heavy chain and H7N9vac-m826 Light chain docked complexes. The most reliable cluster was selected based HADDOCK score for each complex.Full size tableRegarding the binding of the vaccine to the m826 antibody, 4 hydrogen bonds in H7N9vac-m826 Heavy chain complex and 6 hydrogen bonds in H7N9vac-m826 Light chain complex were responsible for the interaction between the vaccine and the antibody, respectively (Figs. 9b and 10b). 2D interactions are summarized and visualized in Supplementary Fig. S5. Besides, Graphical HADDOCK results are presented in Supplementary Figs. S6, S7, S8 and S9.Molecular dynamic and MM/PBSA analysisThe complexes were simulated by MD for 40 ns. The MD simulation results showed that the hydrogen bond in the H7N9vac-TLR7 and H7N9vac-TLR8 complexes was formed with the RMSD of 0.5 and 1 nm, respectively (Fig. 11a). Also, RMSD for H7N9vac-m826 Heavy chain and H7N9vac-m826 Light chain complexes were 0.6 and 0.9 nm, respectively (Fig. 11b).Figure 11MD simulation results of H7N9v with proteins complex. (a) RMSD graph of H7N9vac-TLR7and H7N9vac-TLR8 complexes. (b) RMSD graph of H7N9vac-m826 Heavy chain H7N9vac-m826 Light chain complexes. (c), (d), (e) and (f) RMSF graph of H7N9vac-TLR7, H7N9vac-TLR8, H7N9vac-m826 Heavy chain and H7N9vac-m826 Light chain complexes.Full size imageThe RMSF diagram indicated the residues in the H7N9vac-TLR7 and H7N9vac-TLR8 complexes in the MD simulation have very low volatility (Fig. 11c,d). H7N9vac-m826 Heavy chain and H7N9vac-m826 Light chain complexes showed a RMSF about 0.4 to 0.5 nm (Fig. 11e,f). These results indicate the maintenance of H7N9 structure in binding with the TLR7, TLR8 and m826 Heavy/Light chain. The H7N9vac-TLR7 and H7N9vac-TLR8 complexes returned to equilibrium after 12 ns, while, H7N9vac-m826 Heavy chain and H7N9vac-m826 Light chain complexes showed equilibrium about 10 ns since MD starting.The gyration radius related to the H7N9vac-TLR7, H7N9vac-TLR8, H7N9vac-m826 Heavy chain and H7N9vac-m826 Light chain complexes are shown in supplementary Figure S10 as well as the H-Bond overall results.The binding affinity of H7N9vac-TLR7, H7N9vac-TLR8, H7N9vac-m826 Heavy chain and H7N9vac-m826 Light chain complexes was confirmed using MM/PBSA calculations. The energy of the bonds formed between the receptor and the vaccine in each complex is calculated and as shown in Table 6. The total binding energy in H7N9vac-TLR7 and H7N9vac-TLR8 complexes is − 793.544 ± 35 kJ/mol and 1574.578 ± 72 kJ/mol, respectively, which indicated a high affinity between H7N9vac and TLR7. However, the amount of positive energy in H7N9vac-TLR8 complex probably stems from the existence of salt bridges between the H7N9vac and TLR8 structures.Table 6 MM/PBSA analysis of MD simulation results of H7N9vac-TLR7, H7N9vac-TLR8, H7N9vac-m826 Heavy chain and H7N9vac-m826 Light chain complexes.Full size tableThe H7N9vac-m826 Heavy chain and H7N9vac-m826 Light chain complexes also have binding energies of − 503.155 ± 67 kJ/mol and − 657.380 ± 66 kJ/mol, respectively, which indicates that the structure of the H7N9vac binds to both the heavy and light chains of m826 antibody.Besides, further studies show that in addition to total binding energy, van der Waals and electrostatic energies have also influenced the complexes that the contribution of van der Waals energy in the H7N9vac-TLR7 and H7N9vac-TLR8 complexes is − 285.137 ± 24 kJ/mol and 178.801 ± 18 kJ/mol, respectively. The electrostatic energy was − 986.686 ± 83 kJ/mol for H7N9vac-TLR7 complexes as well as 987.490 ± 67 kJ/mol for H7N9vac-TLR8.van der Waal energy and Electrostatic energy for the H7N9vac-m826 Heavy chain complex were − 300.517 ± 14 and − 570.977 ± 89, respectively. In addition, the H7N9vac-m826 Light chain complex had van der Waal energy and Electrostatic energy equal to − 163.482 ± 25 and − 1685.757 ± 160, respectively. Generally, these results indicate that both complexes are stable, especially in H7N9vac-TLR7, H7N9vac-m826 Heavy chain and H7N9vac-m826 Light chain complexes.Immune simulationThe results of online server C-ImmSim showed increased production of secondary immune responses consistent with the actual immune response. Increased levels of IgG2 antibodies and total IgM + IgG1 also increased as the immune response increased (Fig. 12a). The amount of B memory (y2) also increased with decreasing IgG1 and IgG2 isotypes (Fig. 12b). Besides, it has been shown that as TH memory (y2) increases (Fig. 12c), TH and TC cell populations increase (Fig. 12d). Finally, the produced IFN-γ concentration and TH cell population were increased (Fig. 12e,f). The results show that the simulated immune response immunization by the Influenza H7N9vac on the C-ImmSim server corresponds to the actual immune response.Figure 12Simulation of the immune response against H7N9vac construct.

This indicates that birds can be a natural host of the influenza A virus29. Studies have shown that the H7N9 virus is derived by reassortment between antigens expressed on the surface of the virus (H7N9) from wild birds and antigens expressed on the internal of the virus (H9N2) in poultry6. So far, 5 waves of epidemics have been caused by H7N930,31. Reports indicate that the first wave of epidemic viruses is most similar to the first virus discovered from this lineage (A/Shanghai/1/2013)32,33.Phylogenetic tree analysis for both HA and NA antigens showed that all H7N9 viruses in this study were located in polytomous clades with a common ancestor. HA and NA are spread in three continents of America, Europe and Asia. However, A/Shanghai/2/2013 influenza H7N9 from China, as human-derived influenza H7N9 along with avian and environmental influenza H7N9, associated with a common ancestor in the phylogenetic tree. Further studies of source diversity show that more than 81% of HA and NA influenza H7N9 is avian-mediated. Human-mediated H7N9 influenza is also approximately 15% and 16% related to HA and NA, respectively. Influenza virus transmission from birds to humans is rare due to host range restrictions. Besides, studies have shown that influenza A viruses select birds' intestinal tract for replication, while in humans, the virus replicates in the respiratory system. But reports confirm the transmission of H7N9, which can cause infection in humans. Although sustained transmission of avian influenza from human to human has not been reported, the occurrence of mutations in which the virus can adapt to human circulating, along with the lack of protective antibodies for humans, raises the risk of an H7N9 virus pandemic34,35. Furthermore, immune selection pressures, along with natural selection pressures, are the most important causes of antigenic drift and antigenic shift in IAVs, causing them to evolve continuously. As a result of this continuous evolution, the influenza epidemic and recurring pandemics occur, which can have very serious consequences for human society, such as the Covid-19 pandemic36.Here, is introduced a multi-epitope vaccine against the H7N9 virus including immunogenic peptides of HA and NA proteins. HA protein, which is the most important determinant of antigen and viral entry into the host cell. NA protein was also used in the design of the vaccine, which is known for contributing to the release of the influenza virus into cell37. We utilized immunoinformatics tools to develop multi-epitope vaccines that are capable of producing humoral and cellular immunity. The multi-epitope vaccine provides its immunogenicity advantage, based on short immunogenic sequences containing appropriate immune responses. This method can prevent antigen overload as well as allergic responses in the host38. Total antigen sequence analysis can be performed using immunoinformatics and molecular instruments to investigate the possibility of T cell receptor (TCR) binding to host immune proteins39.One of the unique features of multi-epitope vaccines over traditional vaccines is that multi-epitope vaccines can induce both humoral and cellular immune responses due to the presence of both B cell and T cell epitopes40. For screening of predicted CTL and HTL epitopes, special immunological characteristics such as antigenicity, immunogenicity and ability to bind to several MHC class I and MHC class II alleles were considered. T cell epitopes were predicted and it was found that a vaccine candidate made using the appropriate epitope could provide adequate immunogenicity if expressed.B-cell epitopes are regions on the surface of antigens that specific antibodies recognize and attach to and stimulate the immune response41,42,43. The ability to identify these binding sites in the antigen sequence or structure is important for the development of recombinant vaccines44. Linear epitopes, which consist of a linear sequence of residues and conformational epitopes, which are composed of residues that are not interconnected in the native protein sequence, but are assembled by the folded protein structure43. However, the vast majority of B cell epitopes are conformational estimated and to a lesser extent linear45. Using BepiPred-2.0 and iBCE-EL servers, we identified linear B cell epitopes and included them in the final vaccine construct. We also used HA and NA crystallographic structures to identify the conformational epitopes obtained from them and after determining the overlap with the linear B cell epitopes, we included them in the final structure to predict the maximum responses related to humoral immunity.HA, as a well-known trimeric surface glycoprotein, is the primary target for the development of antiviral vaccines against influenza virus. HA can bind to sialic acid receptors through the globular head region of HA1 subunit, thereby facilitating the entry of the virus into the cell46,47. In addition, HA causes fusion between viral and cell membranes under the influence of structural changes caused by acidic pHs. It is noteworthy that most influenza antibodies produced by immunization or infection are directed against five antigen sites on the HA1 globular head, Ca1, Ca2, Cb, Sa, and Sb48,49,50. In addition, studies have shown that mAbs are able to target the stem region of HA2 and exert their antiviral effect through Fc-Fcγ receptor interactions and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)46,51,52,53,54.Analysis of the immunogenic properties of a HA1-specific fully human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) called m826 has shown that m826 binds specifically to hemagglutinin H7 (HA1). The m826 has minimal divergence from their germline predecessors, selected from a big naive antibody library created from the blood of healthy adult donors, and specifically targeting H7N946. Interestingly, Yu et al. Showed that the m826 antibody induces very strong antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity and is highly effective against H7N9 virus infection in the mouse model, and is completely protects mice exposed to the lethal challenge H7N9 virus via mechanisms that may include ADCC46. They also used crystal structure to show that m826 binds with a pH-dependent high affinity to a unique epitope distinct from the common HA1 antigen sites identified in the H7N9 HA1 and m826 complexes46. m826 is a germline antibody. this unique feature demonstrates that m826 as a promising therapeutic candidate, provides a tool to study the mechanisms of inhibition of virus infection by antibodies that could be a model for H7N9 vaccine immunogens as well as have the potential to be developed as antiviral agents for vaccine candidates46. In our immunoinformatics studies, we included HA1 B-cells epitopes involved in the heavy and light chain of m826 antibody in our construct, based on the crystallographic structure of m826 in complex with H7N9 HA1.Prolonged immune responses can be enhanced by adding adjuvants to multi-epitope vaccines55. The multi-epitope vaccines can keep us away from the dangers of working directly with antigens or pathogens factors in vitro56,57. The multi-epitope vaccines, in addition to proving their efficacy in vivo by inducing protective immunity, have also entered phase I clinical trials58,59.The EAAAK linker was used to link the adjuvants to each other and attach them to the construct. As rigid linkers between protein domains, EAAAK provides an Alpha helix-forming structure that increases stability, maintains a constant distance, and maintains the independent function of domains60. MHC-I epitopes were linked through AAY. The AAY linker helps to form epitopes in a natural form and does not allow the formation of junctional epitopes, which improves the presentation of the epitope61,62. CTL and HTL epitopes were fused via HEYGAEALERAG to bring an enhanced epitope presentation for the vaccine. HEYGAEALERAG can provide this property through the creation of a specific cleavage target for Proteasomal and lysosomal degradation systems63,64. The GPGPG linker was used to link MHCII epitopes. GPGPG is a glycine-rich linker that in addition to increasing construct solubility, provides freely of activity and high accessibility and flexibility for adjacent domains65. B-cell epitopes were bonded to each other via KK linkers. The KK linker of the lysosomal protease target sequence is cathepsin B, which is one of the important proteases for antigen processing in the field of MHC-II antigen presentation66,67. Linked peptides by KK can help to specially presentation of each peptide to antibodies via avoiding of inducing antibodies into the amino acid sequence that results from the binding of the two peptides67. Finally, the RVRR linker was embedded in the C-terminal construct, where it provides the binding of the vaccine to the His-tag sequence68.The allergenicity and toxicity of the construct designed using the H7N9vac were evaluated using the AllerTOP v.2.0 and ToxDL servers, respectively, and it was confirmed that this protein is non-allergenic and non-toxic. The ProtParam tool provided by the ExPASy server was used to analyze the physicochemical properties of the designed construct. The M/W of the structure was ~ 86.38 kDa and pI was equal to 9.80. The aliphatic index indicated the thermal resilience of the construct after expression. The estimated instability index puts the H7N9vac’s protein in the classification of stable proteins. Because a protein with an instability index of less than 40 is considered stable, and if it tends to be more than 40, it is predicted to be unstable. The computed GRAVY index of the H7N9vac was considered as a reflection of the polar nature of H7N9vac that its effective interaction with water a lower score indicates the high solubility of this structure.Structural validation of H7N9vac via Z-score by web server ProSA score (− 9.29), indicated that this protein can be expected to fall into the category of proteins that include Z-scores of structures determined by X-ray crystallographic experiments (more than 200 amino acids). These results confirmed the overall quality of H7N9vac. Evaluation of the third structure using Ramachandran diagram analysis showed that the maximum amino acids (99.1% residual) were in the allowed range, so the third validity ofH7N9vac structure is proven.Adding adjuvants to a subunit vaccine can help increase the immune response it produces. Adjuvants can act as agonists for TLRs and can act as an effector to expand antibody recognition69. It has been indicated IVA can be recognized by TLR7 and TLR8 because of the TLR7 and TLR8 ability in coupling to ssRNAs70. TLR-7 has been shown to induce a humoral cellular response and long-term memory response in response to the ssRNA-mediate (Influenza and HIV) infection and vaccination71,72. Besides, TLR7 and TLR8 synthetic agonists have been shown to potentiate innate and adaptive immune responses73.Recognition of ssRNA by TLR7 is primarily associated with the activation of downstream pathways of myD88, which can lead to IFN-α antiviral-cytokine and IL23/IL-1β responses (related to LT CD4+ TH17 and T-helper17) via IRF7 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), respectively. Also TLR 8, after recognition and binding to ssRNA, is associated with the activation of downstream pathways of myD88, which activates IRF3, IFN-B responses, and stimulates B cell-mediated humoral immunity. B cell epitopes are recognized by B cell receptors or secretory antibodies and play a very important role in creating an efficient immune response. Both TLR7 and TLR 8, which are referred to as fraternal twins, are jointly involved in myD88-dependent NF-kB activation, ultimately producing IL-12 and stimulating LT CD4+ TH1 and T-helper1 cellular immunity74,75,76,77,78,79.In this regard, HβD-3 was used as an adjuvant, to take advantage of its synergistic and interactive properties with other TLRs and pathways associated with Myd88 downstream, as well as activating the expression of stimulatory molecules in antigen-presenting cells in this pathway80,81. Besides, studies have shown that HβD-3, through TLR1/TLR2-mediated pathways, can induce IFN-γ secretion associated with the cytokine Th-1; in contrast, it is independently involved in the secretion of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and the activation of natural killer (NK) cells82,83.The interaction of H7N9vac protein structures with TLR7 and TLR8 structures was analyzed by protein–protein docking. Analysis of H7N9vac-TLR7 and H7N9vac-TLR8 complexes showed that 6 and 4 hydrogen bonds involved these interactions, respectively. Also, 4 and 6 hydrogen bonds were involved in the interaction of H7N9vac-m826 Heavy chain and H7N9vac-m826 Light chain complexes, respectively.The H7N9vac-TLR7 and H7N9vac-TLR8 complexes showed that proteins interact with each other through the formation of hydrogen bonds. The H7N9vac-TLR7 and H7N9vac-TLR8 complexes RMSD diagrams showed that the simulation was quite stable. However, the mean RMSD of 0.6 nm for the H7N9vac-TLR7 complex is higher than the mean RMSD of 0.3 nm for the H7N9vac-TLR87 complex, indicating that the intermolecular energies in the H7N9vac-TLR8 complex are higher. H7N9vac-m826 Heavy chain and H7N9vac-m826 Light chain complexes showed they are close to each other and mimic each other in RMSD. Also, the graph of gyration shows the amino acid's consistency in their radial axis and they do not go beyond the range of their radius axis, which confirms the stability of the complex during the simulation. The RMSF diagram is also consistent with the results; implying that the amino acids of the H7N9vac-TLR7, H7N9vac-TLR8, H7N9vac-m826 Heavy chain and H7N9vac-m826 Light chain complexes binding sites maintain their stability during the simulation. In general, docking and MD results showed that the complexes can maintain their stability during the simulation. The obtained results in the present study showed that this recombinant construct can help stimulate TLR7/8. Binding of the heavy and light chain of m826 antibody to the residues of the vaccine structure showed that the production of antibodies against the proposed vaccine in this study is to be expected. Because it's important to have the correct 3D structure of the antigen to be recognized by the humoral immune system. Therefore, the B-cell epitopes in the 3D vaccine structure need to mimics the correct fold in the native structure of the antigen to induce the same immune response46.Besides, the MM/PBSA results showed that in addition to the total energy, the complexes are also affected by the energies resulting from covalent and electrostatic bonds. However, the positive binding energy generated in H7N9vac-TLR8 complex can be affected by the salt bridges in the interaction between the vaccine structure and TLR8. Studies have shown that although salt bridges may help stabilize protein associations, they also destabilize protein cores84. In addition, the findings indicate that the salt bridge interactions between acidic amino acids (Glu− and Asp−) and alkaline amino acids (Arg+, Lys+, and His+) are the strongest residual residue interactions. But, may be weakened by the effects of solvation and broken down by lower pH conditions85. These findings are consistent with our results. As seen in H7N9vac-TLR8, salt bridges are formed between glutamine-arginine, aspartate-lysine, and lysine-glutamine and may have affected interactions between vaccine and TLR8.Influenza viruses are ssRNA that, in addition to the humoral immunity induced by B cells, are also required to activate T cell-dependent immune responses to inhibit intracellular survival and proliferation. As the results of the C-ImmSim Online server prediction show, the development of B cells and T cells caused long-term memory. IgG1 and IgG2, which are indices of Th1 and Th2 response to influenza antigens, respectively, are involved in the protection against influenza infection86,87. Previous studies have shown that both human and avian hosts show a decrease in T cell populations in response to AI infection88. Decreased T lymphocytes are often associated with the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines such as interferons (IFNs), especially IFN-γ, as well as interleukins (ILs) such as IL-6, which eventually lead to hypercytokinemia and Activation of cell apoptosis89. Elevated levels of IL-12 and IFN-γ are due to strong cellular immunity. Although studies have shown that T epitopes of H7N9 strains mimicking human sequencing are associated with attenuated IFN responses in humans, the ICM server results in an excellent stimulation of FN-γ by this shows the vaccine90,91,92. However, ICM server results indicate that the increase in the number of Th1 cells is associated with an increase in the level of Cytotoxic T cells.Material and methodsProtein sequences retrieval and phylogenetic evolutionThe human-isolated H7N9 influenza virus was considered as a well-known H7N9 for this study93. Hemagglutinin and Neuraminidase from Influenza A virus (A/Shanghai/02/2013(H7N9)) were retrieved from NCBI with YP_009118475.1 and YP_009118481.1 reference sequences, respectively.The HA and NA protein sequences of the A/Shanghai/02/2013 (H7N9) strain were compared and analyzed along with the HA and NA protein sequences of different H7N9 strains in the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU/Databaseph-select.cgi?go=database). The phylogenetic tree was constructed so that 119 out of 761 sequences (16%) for HA protein and 121 out of 741 sequences (16%) for NA protein were excluded in total amino acid sequences based on the NCBI Influenza Virus Resource default parameters. Finally, the phylogenetic trees were drawn through the clustering algorithm of the Neighbor-Joining and F84 distance for protein. The phylogenetic trees were visualized and adjusted in iTOL v5 (https://itol.embl.de/) and Illustrator, respectively.Linear and conformational B Cell epitope predictionB cell epitopes are one of the most important factors contributing to the vaccine design because they are characterized by the immune system. In this study, we used BepiPred-2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/BepiPred/) to identify linear B Cell epitope on HA and NA protein sequences43. BepiPred-2.0 is a web server for predicting B-cell epitopes from antigen sequences. BepiPred-2.0 is based on a random forest algorithm trained on epitopes annotated from antibody-antigen protein structures. BepiPred-2.0 utilizes sequence-based epitope prediction both on epitope data derived from 3D structures, and on a large collection of linear epitopes downloaded from the IEDB database.Also, iBCE-EL (http:/hegleelab.org/iBCE-EL/) was used to confirm B-cell epitopes which were selected by BepiPred-2.0. iBCE-EL is a web based prediction server for linear B-cell epitope. It is an ensemble method that combined extremely randomized tree and gradient boosting algorithms, which respectively utilizes a combination of amino acid composition and physicochemical properties and a combination of dipeptide and physicochemical properties as an input features. For a given peptide, iBCE-EL predicts its calss and probability values95.It is estimated that more than 90% of B cell epitopes are discontinuous; implying they contain sequences that are far from each other by long-distance pathogenic protein sequences but are adjacent by protein folding properties. From the server ElliPro (http:/ools.iedb.org/ellipro/) B cell epitopes were used to predict the three-dimensional structure.Cytotoxic T cell epitopePrediction of T cell epitopes was performed using an improved neural network method provided by the NetMHC—4.0 server at https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?NetMHC-4.0. All epitopes were considered as 9mers-long for cytotoxic T Cell prediction (recommended from server), which are recognized by the HLA Class including HLA-B, HLA-B, and HLA-C molecules. The threshold for strong and weak binders was adjusted 0.5 and 2, respectively.Helper T cell epitopeThe NetMHCII 2.3 server was used to predict the binding of epitopes MHC-II. The NetMHCII 2.3 server utilizes an artificial neuron network for predicting epitope affinity for HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, HLA-DP molecules.TAP transport/Proteasomal cleavageNetCTL 1.2 Server was used to predict transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and Proteasomal cleavage. The server uses an algorithm that simultaneously provides an integrated prediction of the peptide MHC class I binding, TAP transport efficiency and Proteasomal C terminal cleavage. The default settings were considered as weight in C terminal cleavage equal 0.15 and Weight on TAP transport efficiency equal 0.05.IFN-γ cytokine inducer predictionPrediction of IFN-gamma cytokine inducer epitopes was performed via the online server http://crdd.osdd.netaghava/ifnepitope/index.php. IFN-γ is considered an important factor in inducing intracellular Th1 immune responses that elicit antiviral activity in both adaptive and innate immune systems. Using this server, MHC class II-binding peptides capable of inducing IFN-γ from CD4 + T cells were predicted and settings were adjusted so that Support Vector Machine (SVM) based was select on IFN-γ versus other cytokines.Determination of population coveragePopulation coverage tool in IEDB server (http:/ools.iedb.org/population) was utilized for determining the coverage rate of the population for any selected epitope. Population coverage estimation can help in an appropriate epitopes prediction for different HLA binding. Epitopes with increased HLA binding can coverage different frequencies in different ethnicities which leads to eliminating denominated MHC restriction of T cell responses. In this regard, MHC-I HLA binding including HLA-B5701, HLA-B5802, HLA-B5801, HLA-B2705, HLA-A2603, HLA-A0203, HLA-B8301, HLA-A3002, HLA-B4002, HLA-B4402, HLA-A2902, HLA-C0401 and HLA-C0303 as well as HLA-A0203, HLA-A6601, HLA-A2402 and HLA-B1517 were evaluated for HA and NA proteins, respectively. Besides, MHC-II HLA binding including DRB1_0101, DPA10103-DPB10301, DPA10201-DPB10501, DQA10501-DQB10201, DPA10103-DPB10401, DRB1_0403 as well as DRB1_0404, DRB1_0402, DRB1_0403, DQA10102-DQB10501, DRB1_1302, DRB1_0401, DQA10401-DQB10402 and DQA10301-DQB10302 were evaluated for HA and NA proteins, respectively.Epitopes conservation analysisIEDB conservancy analysis tool was considered a monitoring tool for investigation of the degree of conservation in the selected epitopes in comparison to other similar sequences. Epitopes are showing with minimum 0 and maximum 100 percent conservation in different lengths.Insilico cloning and vaccine optimizationThe codon optimization for recombinant construct expression in the pET-26b(+) vector was performed applying the Java Utility Server (JCat) (http://www.prodoric.de/JCat). Given that the expression host used in the present study is different from the native influenza host, the codon optimization was adjusted based on the codon preference of influenza structure in E. coli K12. The CAI score and GC content are ideally 1.0 and 30–70% respectively, which are used to predict protein expression measures. Using the SnapGene tool, the sites of the NdeI and XhoI restriction enzymes were identified on the optimized nucleotide sequence, and the recombinant influenza gene sequence was inserted into the pET-26b(+) vector.EAAAK linkers were used to link HβD-3 and PADRE adjuvants at the N-terminal construct. Then AAY linkers bonded CTL epitopes to each other. The HEYGAEALERAG linker was placed as the interface between CTL epitopes and HTL epitopes. The GPGPG linkers also acted as the link between HTL epitopes. The KK linkers were used to stick B-cell epitopes. Finally, RVRR bonded construct to HisTag sequence in C-terminal of vaccine construct.Prediction of disulfide bond formation in construct was performed via DiANNA 1.1 server (http://clavius.bc.edu/~clotelab/DiANNA/main.html). This server utilizes a SVM, along with an architecture neural network state-of-the-art method to determine cysteine species and disulfide connectivity.Physicochemical, antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity properties of the vaccine.ProtParam tool in the ExPASy server (https://web.expasy.org/protparam/) provided a prediction of physicochemical properties for the final protein construct. VaxiJen v2.0 server on http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/vaxijen/VaxiJen.html was used for predicting the antigen. The VaxiJen is considered an independent alignment method. Server accuracy varies from 70 to 89%96. Total protein sensitivity was calculated by AllerTOP v. 2.0 (https://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/AllerTOP/). AllerTOP v. 2.0 server benefits from an auto cross-covariance (ACC) and k-nearest neighbor algorithm (kNN, k = 1) to predict allergenicity of protein in terms of hydrophobicity, molecular weight, secondary structure properties and relative abundance of amino acids. ToxDL server (http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/ToxDL/index.html) was utilized to determine protein toxicity. ToxDL server utilizes an interpretable deep learning-based method to classify proteins in two toxic and non-toxic based on multimodal method including three component of CNNs, InterProscan database and word2vec encoder protein domain.Modeling, refinement, and validation of vaccine constructRoseTTAFold online software (https:/obetta.bakerlab.org/) was used to build the 3D structure. RoseTTAFold is a “three-track” neural network, meaning it simultaneously considers patterns in protein sequences, how a protein’s amino acids interact with one another, and a protein’s possible 3D structure and achieved accuracies approaching those of DeepMind. In RoseTTAFold architecture, one-, two-, and three-dimensional information flows back and forth, allowing the network to collectively reason about the relationship between a protein’s chemical parts and its folded structure97.To ensure the accuracy of the simulated building, http://services.mbi.ucla.edu/PROCHECK and http://services.mbi.ucla.edu/SAVES were used. The PROSA server (https://prosa.services.came.sbg.ac.at/prosa.pHp) determined the Z-Score point and protein energy balance. The Ramachandran plot graph was drawn by the online website http://molprobity.biochem.duke.edu/. Chimera V 1.13.1 software determined the best spatial resolution for the optimal energy used in the present study. The website of http://galaxy.seoklab.org/cgi-bin/submit.cgi?type=REFINE was used to structure refinement.The prediction of protein secondary structureNetSurfP-2.0 online software (https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?NetSurfP-2.0) was used for predicting the second structure. NetSurfP-2.0 as a sequence-based tool provides a prediction of amino acids secondary structure so that with utilizing a deep machine learning it combined predicted structural features of amino acids including disorders, Phi/Psi angles and surface accessibility to visualizes a protein secondary structure.Molecular docking of vaccine constructs with TLR7 and TLR8 receptorTLR7 (PDB code: 7CYN), TLR8 (PDB code: 3w3g) and human germline monoclonal antibody (m826) (PDB code: 5vag) 3D structures were retrieved from RCSB server. Then, the 3D structures of TLRs and m826 were corrected in PyMOL v2.3.4 software for energy. All water molecules were removed from the PDB structure of the vaccine, TLRs and m826. After preparing the 3D structure in Chimera V 1.13.1 software, Influenza constructs, TLR7, TLR8 and m826 were submitted to the HADDOCK server so that the interaction regions will be identified. The highest rankings for each complex were selected at the lowest intermolecular binding of the whole-molecular influenza-TLRs and whole-molecular influenza- m826 heavy and light chains from the HADDOCK with the lowest mean RMSD. H-band formation was assessed by the LigPlot+.Molecular dynamics and MM/PBSA analysisThe molecular dynamics calculation of the vaccine-TLR7/8 and vaccine-m826 complexes were performed by Gromacs v 4.6.5 and CHARMM36 all-atom force field. Protein–protein complexes were filled with water molecules and then the system was neutralized. The energy minimization of the system was done. The NVT and NPT optimization were done at a temperature of 300 K, the pressure of 1 bar and restraint forces of 1000 kJ/mol. Then, molecular dynamics simulation was performed for 40,000 ps. All bonds were constrained by applying the LINCS algorithm during the simulation.Immune simulations of vaccine constructSimulating and predicting the immune response of recombinant influenza structure was performed using the C-ImmSim server. C-ImmSim used an agent-based model for machine learning techniques and immune epitope prediction that utilized a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) that allowed it for the prediction of immune interactions. C-ImmSim simulates three distinct anatomical regions for mammals simultaneously. These include bone marrow (to simulate hematopoietic stem cells, lymphoid cells and myeloid cells), thymus (native T cell selection), and the third lymph node, such as the lymph node. Taking into account the 4-week interval between the first and second dose of the vaccine, the Simulation Steps parameter was set to 1050. Then 3 injections were considered so that time-steps were set at 1, 84 and 168, while an one time-step is equal to eight hours of real life. Other parameters were applied by default in this study.

Here are a few easy ways to tellRight now, other parts of the country are seeing pre-pandemic-like flu seasons.Washington D.C. has some of the highest flu activity. The CDC says that now seven states also have high activity including New Mexico, Kansas, Indiana, New Jersey, Tennessee, Georgia and North Dakota.California is not included in that, but Dr. Stanley Deresinski, an infection disease physician with Stanford Health Care says we may not be far behind."Flu comes later to California every season than to other parts of the country ordinarily," Dr. Deresinski said. "We haven't even gotten into the real peak influenza season here, which may not be until February."RELATED: Experts expect normal US flu season after year off; hospitalizations rise, 2 child deaths reportedChildhood deaths have been one way flu seasons have been compared year to year.The CDC says that in the 2018-2019 flu season 144 children died from the flu, 199 in the 2019-2020 season. During the last flu season, one child died.Dr. Deresinski says more stringent COVID-19 measures likely had something to do with why last year wasn't as tragic.Still, he says that because the flu wasn't as widespread last season, a big concern has been missing out on natural immunity.RELATED: Bay Area counties report record-breaking number of daily, weekly COVID cases"Many people who get exposed to influenza never get ill, don't know about it, but they have some degree of immunity from that exposure," he said. "That pretty much probably didn't happen last year. So those people would be more at risk."Other groups at risk include the elderly and the very young, those who are immunocompromised and pregnant.Symptoms can include scratchy throat, cough, fever, body aches and headaches: all similar to COVID symptoms.Dr. Deresinski says knowing whether or not you have the flu or COVID can't be determined by symptoms alone.RELATED: CDC cuts isolation restrictions for those who catch COVID, recommends shorter quarantine for all"COVID can sometimes, like influenza present with almost no symptoms or no symptoms whatsoever, but can have exactly the same symptoms as in influenza," he said, "So you really can't tell, it really is a matter of being tested."The good news is that if you've gotten your flu shot and are doing the right things to protect yourself from COVID, you're greatly reducing your risk of the flu."It's exactly the same protective measures," Deresinski said.Report a correction or typoCopyright © 2024 KGO-TV.

(Mike Moore/CBC)Environment Canada says a highly pathogenic avian influenza first identified on a farm on the Avalon Peninsula has been found in birds around the St. John's area.In a statement from the City of St. John's on Friday, officials said Environment Canada had confirmed the influenza, known as H5N1 and often called bird flu, has been found in wild birds in Bowring Park, Quidi Vidi Lake and other areas frequented by flocks of birds."Like our human flu, it has variants that we refer to as highly pathogenic, meaning that they cause illness and death in birds that get infected with them," said Ian Jones, a biology professor at Memorial University.The city has asked residents not to feed, touch or handle wild birds, including ducks, pigeons and gulls.Cases of H5N1 were first identified on the island around mid-December on an exhibition farm on the island, according to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and a report from the World Organisation for Animal Health.Discovery of avian flu puts N.L. exhibition farm under quarantineJones said the flu circulates naturally in birds, with higher case numbers in Europe signalling a higher risk for North American poultry flocks this year. The disease is often found in birds such as chickens, turkeys, quails, and guinea fowl, as well as pet and wild birds.Jones suspects the flu came from Europe in recent months, as some species of geese not usually seen in North America have been found in the province following an October windstorm.Storm surge, wind warnings lifted, but gusts persist on Avalon, Bonavista peninsulas"It was a major system filling almost the entire North Atlantic, producing very strong winds from northern Europe straight across and then down to Newfoundland, including the Avalon Peninsula. Migrating waterfowl, especially geese from Europe, were caught up in this," he said."Birdwatchers have observed in eastern Canada an unprecedented number of barnacle geese and pink-footed geese, two European geese species that don't normally occur here."Jones said the risk of humans getting the disease is low and it would involve dealing with the insides of infected animals. The biggest risk, Jones said, comes in agriculture and the poultry industry.The exhibition farm where the disease was first identified doesn't produce birds for sale, the agency said, adding it won't have an effect on poultry trade. The farm was under quarantine, which included a 10-kilometre zone with movement control measures and enhanced biosecurity to limit the potential spread of the disease.According to the World Organisation for Animal Health, 419 birds were identified to be carrying the flu. Of those, 360 died, while 59 had to be euthanized.In a statement to CBC News earlier this month, Country Ribbon — the province's largest poultry producer — said production wouldn't be affected and strict monitoring was taking place to ensure safety at their farms.Read more from CBC Newfoundland and LabradorWith files from William Ping and The Canadian PressCBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices|About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications|Submit a news tip|Report errorRelated Stories Discovery of avian flu puts N.L. exhibition farm under quarantine Storm surge, wind warnings lifted, but gusts persist on Avalon, Bonavista peninsulasFooter LinksMy AccountProfileCBC GemNewslettersAbout CBC AccountsConnect with CBCFacebookXYouTubeInstagramMobileRSSPodcastsContact CBCSubmit FeedbackHelp CentreAudience Relations, CBC P.O.

Fluarix Quadrivalent, pictured here, is the flu shot pharmacies are using to protect against disease caused by influenza A subtype viruses and type B viruses. DEVIN WEEKS/Press Pharmacists Jason Head, left, and Korey Kreider demonstrate a flu shot administration Monday at Medicine Man Prairie Pharmacy. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare announced a Gooding County man older than 65 has been reported as Idaho's first flu death of the 2021-2022 flu season. Previous Next by DEVIN WEEKS Hagadone News Network | December 28, 2021 1:00 AM ▶️ Listen to this article now. An eagerness for community members to be inoculated against influenza has been evident this flu season. Pharmacist Korey Kreider, who co-owns four local Medicine Man Pharmacies, said he calculates about 200 more flu shots have been administered at those four locations this season than were administered last year at this time. Although prime time to receive a flu shot is Oct. 1 to the end of November, Kreider said it's never too late to get one. "It's always good to protect yourself," he said. On Monday, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare reported that a Gooding County man older than 65 was the first influenza-related death of the 2021-2022 flu season. “The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare is reminding residents that flu is here, and it can be very serious,” Dr. Leslie Tengelsen, Idaho influenza surveillance coordinator, stated in a news release. Influenza activity had been detected in Idaho and across the country ahead of the holiday season. "With both influenza and the virus that causes COVID-19 circulating this season, we are concerned that the risk to Idahoans for both infections will increase as families and friends gather for the holidays," Tengelsen said. "One important prevention measure to reduce serious respiratory illness for Idahoans is to get an annual influenza vaccine.” Local pharmacies are experiencing high volumes of requests - but not necessarily flu or other vaccines. "We're getting slammed with COVID tests," Kreider said. He said COVID-19 boosters can be simultaneously administered, although some people might have a response that keeps them on the couch for a day or so. "It doesn’t give you the flu,” he said. “It’s just making your body work so hard that it’s taking all that extra energy to build up your immune response. You’re going to sleep, you’re going to feel like garbage, but it’s going to make you stronger in the next two weeks." Fluarix Quadrivalent influenza vaccine is the shot being used to prevent disease caused by influenza A subtype viruses and type B viruses contained in the vaccine. It's approved for use in persons aged 6 months and older. Flu shots are covered by health insurance and available at area pharmacies. "It's one of the cheapest, easiest ways to prevent getting sick," Medicine Man Prairie pharmacist Jason Head said. A second flu wave usually arrives in February and March, Kreider said. That's why the prime time to receive a flu shot is in late fall. "Your second wave around here, it can knock you on your butt," he added.

The screenshot was liked more than 1,000 times in less than 24 hours. Other posts also received hundreds of likes in just a few hours.But the claim badly mangles the facts.The CDC's PCR test will be removed from the list of tests under emergency use authorization because the demand for it has decreased with the authorization of other diagnostic tests – not because it confuses viruses. Experts say the test would not show false positives for COVID-19 if the person only had the flu.Special access for subscribers! Click here to sign up for our fact-check text chatUSA TODAY reached out to the user who posted the claim and to Gateway Pundit for comment.CDC's PCR test does not confuse COVID-19 and fluThe Gateway Pundit article claims the CDC admitted the soon-to-be-retired PCR test "can not differentiate between the flu and COVID virus."It claimed flu cases were so low in 2020, then, because the test was counting flu cases as COVID-19. But that's nonsense. Gateway Pundit was misunderstanding the use of the term differentiate.In an August news release, the CDC wrote the PCR test was specifically designed only to detect the viral genetic material of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 – not influenza, which causes the flu."It does not detect influenza or differentiate between influenza and SARS-CoV-2," the website states.In other words, it's not that the test can't tell the two apart, it's that the test was designed only to detect COVID-19. The CDC spelled this one by noting someone with the flu would not create a false positive for COVID-19 with this test.Fact check: Made-up Jen Psaki statement on inflation started as satireExperts told USA TODAY in July it's "technically impossible" for the CDC's PCR test to confuse SARS-CoV-2 and the influenza virus.PCR tests identify and amplify converted viral RNA until the virus's genetic makeup can be detected and analyzed.In this case, since the CDC's PCR test was made to only identify SARS-Cov-2, it cannot detect or confuse the genetic sequences of another virus such as influenza, according to Dr. Petros Giannikopoulos, medical director of the Innovative Genomics Institute’s COVID-19 testing consortium.CDC withdrawing PCR test to focus on other goalsOn July 21, the CDC announced it would withdraw the request for an emergency use authorization for the agency-developed PCR test after Dec. 31.The test will be removed because the Food and Drug Administration, which is in charge of approving the use of medical devices and vaccines, has authorized "hundreds" of other COVID-specific tests similar to the CDC's, the agency said in an Aug. 2 clarification after the announcement sparked confusion."CDC began distributing the CDC 2019 Novel Coronavirus Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel to fill a gap," the release said. "The wide availability of other SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests means that the CDC 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel is no longer filling an unmet need."The discontinuation, which only applies to the CDC-manufactured test and not other diagnostic tests authorized for use by the FDA, would also let the CDC "focus its resources on public health surveillance testing and other response activities," according to the release.Fact check: Chris Wallace's CNN+ show has not yet debutedJasmine Reed, a CDC spokeswoman, told USA TODAY in July the agency also wanted to encourage laboratories to start using tests that can detect the influenza virus and COVID-19 in the same swab to conserve time and resources.The CDC has its own test that can detect and differentiate COVID-19 and the influenza A and B viruses. That test is not being withdrawn.USA TODAY reached out to the CDC for comment.Our rating: FalseBased on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that the CDC withdrew the use of its PCR test and admitted it can't distinguish between the flu and COVID-19. The CDC is withdrawing the test, but it has nothing to do with the flu. The agency-created PCR test simply isn't needed because hundreds of tests from private companies have addressed this need and been approved by the FDA. The CDC test properly showed positive results only for COVID-19; a person with the flu could not test positive for COVID-19 using the CDC test, experts say.Our fact-check sources:The Gateway Pundit, Dec. 29, Huge.

Actual increases in the number of ILI cases is seen in Solomon Islands for the week. A reduction of ILI cases were seen in Cook Islands . The decrease seen New Caledonia and Fiji may be due to the decreased number of sites reported for the week. No changes were seen to the number of ILI cases in RMI Nil ILI cases were reported for the week from the Pitcairn Islands and Palau. No reports were available from CNMI, Kiribati, French Polynesia, FSM, Niue, Tuvalu, Tonga, Tokelau, Vanuatu, Wallis & Futuna and Samoa for the week. American Samoa, Guam and Nauru have not participated in the surveillance. Surveillance figures are not intended to capture all country cases but to describe trends over time and are invaluable when trends rise beyond country baselines which should then trigger alerts and timely actions to characterize the actual nature and magnitude of the disease.

Here, we report on a rapidly deployed active syndromic surveillance system for tracking COVID-19 in Israel. The system was a novel combination of active and passive components: Ads were shown to people searching for COVID-19 symptoms on the Google search engine. Those who clicked on the ads were referred to a chat bot which helped them decide whether they needed urgent medical care. Through its conversion optimization mechanism, the ad system was guided to focus on those people who required such care. Over 6 months, the ads were shown approximately 214,000 times and clicked on 12,000 times, and 722 people were informed they needed urgent care. Click rates on ads and the fraction of people deemed to require urgent care were correlated with the hospitalization rate (\(R^2=0.54\) and \(R^2=0.50\), respectively) with a lead time of 9 days. Males and younger people were more likely to use the system, and younger people were more likely to be determined to require urgent care (slope: \(- \,0.009\), \(P=0.01\)). Thus, the system can assist in predicting case numbers and hospital load at a significant lead time and, simultaneously, help people determine if they need medical care.

These methods differ in the size of their cohort, the amount of data collected from each person, and whether the data are collected continuously or only when people experience a medical event. They are mostly passive in that they rely on data that are continuously collected from a predefined cohort and that focus on well-known signals.Internet data in general and search engine queries in particular have come to the forefront of research into syndromic surveillance, especially for tracking respiratory diseases such as influenza-like illness (ILI)6–8, norovirus9, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)10.The application of internet-based syndromic surveillance has, to date, been limited. Several notable examples include the detection of food-borne illnesses through online searches11 and HealthMap’s tracking of the 2009 H1N1 influena epidemic12. During the recent COVID19 pandemic, Public Health England incorporated reports based on Google search data into its weekly reports (https://www.gov.uk/governmentews/weekly-covid-19-surveillance-report-published).The added value of internet data for tracking the above-mentioned conditions stems from the fact that most people with, for example, ILI, will not seek medical care but many will search about the condition or mention it in social media postings13.One of the major disadvantages of passive internet-based syndromic surveillance systems is that data are often available without context and are often not medically validated. For example, the fact that a person queries for influenza treatments does not necessarily mean they are suffering from the disease. Thus, it is necessary to filter these data or use them as input to models which are tuned with data from past outbreaks for which both symptom rates and prevalence are known retrospectively.Another drawback of internet-based syndromic surveillance systems is data access. In most cases, companies collecting internet data tightly control it for privacy reasons. Therefore, access is possible only in aggregate (e.g., Google Trends, www.trends.google.com) or in collaboration with these companies. Interestingly, the COVID-19 pandemic led Google14 and Bing15 to release more granular search engine data pertaining to the pandemic.An alternative to passive syndromic surveillance systems are systems which actively collect syndromic data through, for example, online advertising. Search advertising allows commercial advertisers to show their ads to users who query a search engine for specific terms. The ads comprise of both text and imagery. Users who click on the ads are directed to the advertiser’s website. Users’ interactions with the ads are available in aggregate to advertisers as a way to understand the performance of their ads campaign and to improve it. Advertisers usually pay when users click on the ads. Importantly, in the context of health advertising, ad systems usually limit the terms which can be targeted by advertisers. For example, targeting pharmaceutical drugs usually requires special approval by ad-system administrators.A novel use of advertising is syndromic surveillance, which can enable health organizations to overcome many of the challenges highlighted above, including data access. For example, Eysenbach16 demonstrated that the percentage of flu-related ads which were clicked by users (also known as the clickthrough rate, CTR) searching for flu-related terms was well correlated with the number of influenza cases. Ad systems can be trained to focus on specific users, based on their location, demographics, and past interests, using a feedback mechanism known as conversion optimization. This feature of the ad systems was designed to help advertisers focus on users who will purchase a product, not just click on ads. In the context of health, conversion optimization was previously used to identify people who were likely to suffer from one of three types of cancer17 and help them reach medical care earlier. In that work, ads were shown to people who were looking to self-diagnose one of three solid-tumor cancers. People who clicked on the ads were shown a clinically validated questionnaire whose output was used as the feedback signal to the advertising system. Responses to the questionnaire which were indicative of possible cancer were treated as positive feedback. Over time, the advertising system learned to focus on people who were likely to have questionnaire responses indicative of possible cancer, such that around 12% of the people who clicked on the ads had such questionnaire responses (from a baseline rate of under 1%).COVID-19 was first reported in Israel in late February 202018. By the end of 2020, over 425 thousand cases and 3371 deaths were reported. Here, we describe an active syndromic surveillance system for COVID-19 which builds on the above-mentioned work and was operational for approximately 6 months from April 2020. We report on the development and running of an online advertising campaign which simultaneously assisted in city-level syndromic surveillance and helped people who were experiencing relevant symptoms decide if they should seek medical care.MethodsOverviewWe advertised to people in Israel who made COVID-19-related symptom queries through the Google Ads platform. People who clicked on the ads were referred to the Microsoft Healthcare Bot. The interaction with the bot helped people understand the severity of their symptoms vis-à-vis their demographics and underlying medical conditions. The COVID19 instance of the Bot was created and managed by Israel’s second-largest hospital.The advertising system was set to maximize the number of conversions. People who “converted” were defined as those people whose responses to the Healthcare Bot indicated that they were in need of urgent medical care.Note that the algorithm used by the Healthcare Bot was independent of the advertising system. Therefore, the only way that conversion rates could be increased by the advertising system is by identifying people who were at higher likelihood for hospitalization according to the information that the ads system had about its users.Analysis of user interactions with the ads and the Healthcare Bot at both the country and city levels helped predict COVID-19 case numbers and hospitalizations.Search advertising campaignSearch advertising campaign1s consist of three main elements: keywords that, if used by a searcher, will trigger the appearance of an ad; the text of the ads; and the landing page, which is the page that a user will be referred to by clicking on an ad.Ads were shown on the Google search engine to people in Israel. Google Adwords specifies that a user’s physical location is determined by IP address or by device location (see https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2453995). The ads were shown in response to queries containing one of the following terms (in Hebrew): dry cough, fever, stuffy nose, difficulty breathing, diarrhea, tiredness, headache, nausea, throat pain, or vomiting. The list of symptoms was based on the United Kingdom National Health Service’s first few hundred (FF100) survey on COVID-1919.The ads comprised a short (one sentence) title and a 1–3 sentence body. The ads are shown in Table 1. In practice, Google forbade ads which mentioned COVID-19, and therefore two ads were not shown by the ad system.The campaign was run in Hebrew.Once the elements of the campaign are decided upon (e.g., the text of the ads is prepared) setting up the campaign requires 1–2 h.Google AdWords provides aggregated information on the results of the ad campaign, including measures of the campaign (number of impressions, clicks, and conversions) over time, stratified by city (e.g., Haifa, Jerusalem, etc.), gender, and age group (18–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64, and 65 and over). We denote the number of clicks out of all impressions as the clickthrough rate (CTR). The rate of conversions out of all clicks is denoted by the conversion rate (ConvR). Aggregated information can be downloaded at any time, and its processing, to predict, e.g., future hospitalization rates, can occur in near real-time.Table 1 Advertisement text.Full size tableMicrosoft health botPeople who clicked on the campaign ads were referred to an instance of the Microsoft Healthcare Bot (https://www.microsoft.com/en-usesearch/project/health-bot/) which was installed by the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Israel’s second largest hospital. The bot was configured by medical professionals to ask people about their demographics, underlying health conditions, and the symptoms they were experiencing. At the end of the interaction, the bot provided people with one of three outcomes: stay at home, call the family physician, or go to an emergency room. The latter was used as a feedback signal to the conversion optimization mechanism.Ground truth case dataWe retrospectively compared data from the advertising campaign to the Israeli Ministry of Health’s COVID-19 data repository (https://data.gov.il/dataset/covid-19). Specifically, our data was compared to the COVID-19 by area dataset, which provides information on the number of new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people in each city on each day and the number of hospitalizations at these temporal and spatial resolutions. We refer to these as the case rate and hospitalization rate, respectively.We note that case counts and hospitalizations are known to be noisy proxies for disease incidence, affected by policy, resources, and test accuracy. However, at the time of writing, these are the most comprehensive publicly available city-level data on COVID-19 in Israel.Demographic dataWe collected city-level demographic data from two official sources: Total population and the percentage of Arab citizens in a city from the Israeli Statistic Bureau20 and the median monthly income (2011), percentage of people earning less than the minimum wage and Gini index from the Israel National Insurance Institute21. These were used to evaluate differences in the demographics of people who utilized the campaign.Data analysisThe correlation between the advertising-system measures and the pandemic indicators, taking into account the share of keywords for which the campaign ads were shown, was estimated through a linear model operating at daily granularity. The independent parameters of the model were either CTR or ConvR, expenditure per day, and the share of search impressions that day. The dependent parameters of the model were the case rates and hospitalization rates. Since it is hypothesized that campaign data may predict future indicators of the pandemic, the model is estimated at different lags between the data of the advertising system and those of the pandemic indicators, where a negative lag of k days means that data from the advertising system is correlated with pandemic data taken k days later. Models were estimated for lags ranging from − 14 to + 14 days. ResultsThe advertising campaignThe advertising campaign was run between April 9th and October 12th, 2020. On average, the display of the ads cost US $16 per day. Campaign ads were shown approximately 214,000 times and clicked 11,924 times. During this time period, 722 people completed the interaction with the bot and were advised to reach an emergency room.Through the conversion optimization mechanism, the advertising system was trained to focus on people who it predicted would require referral to urgent medical care. Specifically, we provided a conversion signal from people who received feedback from the Health Bot referring them to urgent care. The average conversion rate per day over the entire campaign was 5.8%. This conversion rate was statistically significantly correlated with CTR (\(r=0.20\), \(P=0.007\)). As Fig. 1 shows, the conversion rate per day rose during the first 21 days of the campaign (\(r=0.47\), \(P=0.033\)), after which it plateaued and was not statistically significantly correlated with the day of the campaign (\(r=-\, 0.09\), \(P>0.05\)).Figure 1Conversion rate per day over the duration of the advertising campaign. The first 21 days of the campaign are colored in blue and the rest in brown. Conversion rate rose during the first 21 days of the campaign (as indicated by the blue regression line) and then plateaued (as shown by the brown regression line).Full size imageThe ad system provides limited information on the performance of the campaign among different populations. An analysis of this information reveals differences in responses to the ad by gender, age, and location. Specifically, CTR among males (6.4%) was higher than that of females (5.6%) (\(\chi ^2\) test, \(P<10^{-5}\)). Similarly, ConvR of males (6.5%) was higher than that of females (5.0%) (\(\chi ^2\) test, \(P=0.002\)).People aged 18–24 had the highest CTR (8.8%), compared to approximately 5.0% for other age groups (\(\chi ^2\) test, \(P<10^{-5}\)). However, ConvR was slightly higher in ages up to 44 (approximately 7.0%), compared to around 4.0% for older people (\(\chi ^2\) test, \(P<10^{-5}\)).A linear regression model in which the independent attributes are gender and age and the dependent variable is CTR is not statistically significant. However, the same model of ConvR reaches \(R^2=0.58\) (\(P=0.020\)). In this model, only age is statistically significantly correlated (slope: \(-\, 0.009\), \(P=0.015\)).City-level models of the number of impressions, CTR and ConvR as a function of the different city’s demographic indicators (see “Demographic data” section) were built to test the economic indicators associated with use of the campaign (\(n=54\)). A model of the number of impressions reached an \(R^2\) of 0.60 with the only statistically significant variable being population (slope: 0.02, \(P=10^{-9}\)). A model of CTR reached \(R^2=0.35\), with the fraction of Arab citizens being statistically significant (slope: 0.01, \(P=0.015\)). Finally, the model of ConvR was not statistically significant.The keywords with the highest CTR were difficulty breathing (10.2%), stuffy nose (5.2%), and dry cough (4.9%). Keywords with the highest ConvR were difficulty breathing (ConvR: 7.9%), throat pain (ConvR: 3.3%), and dry cough (ConvR: 2.7%).Most of the campaign’s ads were shown to mobile platform users (96%), followed by computers (3%), and tablets (1%). However, conversions were most likely on computers (8%) and less so on mobile (6%) and tablets (2%).Correlation of advertising-campaign and pandemic indicatorsThe coefficients of determination (\(R^2\)) between advertising-campaign indicators (CTR and ConvR) and pandemic indicators (case rate and hospitalization rate ) as a function of the lag between the two, for both country- and city-level data, are shown in Fig. 2. The highest value for each is given in Table 2. Note that city-level analysis was conducted for all cities which had at least 20 clicks and 10 days with non-zero conversions over the entire period.The highest correlation is statistically significant in all cases (\(P<10^{-5}\)) and is highest for the correlation between CTR and hospitalizations. The best correlations are reached when data from the advertising system is 8–9 days prior to that of the pandemic indicators. Country-wide correlations are less noisy than city-level indicators, as can be expected. Nevertheless, city-level results are consistent with those of the entire country, with the exception of ConvR, which is correlated with the hospitalization rate at a lag of one day.Figure 2Coefficient of determination (\(R^2\)) as a function of lag for different parameters of the advertising system and indications of the pandemic. The top figures show data for the entire country, while the bottom are at a city level. The left column shows the correlation with CTR and the right column with ConvR. Bold lines denote case rates and dotted lines hospitalization rates. The dots show the highest correlation for each curve. Negative lag indicates that data from the advertising system leads that of the pandemic. Note that vertical axes have different values for country- and city-level graphs.Full size imageTable.2 Highest coefficient of determination (\(R^2\)) and its lag in days (in parenthesis), for different parameters of the advertising system and indications of the pandemic.Full size tableDiscussionMany syndromic surveillance methods exist for discovering emerging disease outbreaks and for monitoring ongoing epidemics. These methods, however, often rely on known cohorts or groups of volunteers, specific disease diagnoses, or known symptom combinations. When a novel outbreak begins, adapting these systems to the new disease can be difficult and can take valuable time.An alternative, especially when some of the people affected by the outbreak may not visit a health provider, is to field an active syndromic surveillance system as described here. Specifically, this system requires two main components: an online advertising system capable of optimizing its resources according to feedback and a questionnaire which provides the system with feedback on whether people who clicked on the ads were relevant to the tracked disease. As we showed, the questionnaire can have the added benefit of informing people whether they should seek medical treatment.The advantage of the syndromic surveillance system described here is that it does not require people to have a verified indication of their condition, which they may not have either because they are not diagnosed yet or because they perceive their condition as not serious enough to warrant visiting a health provider.Our findings indicate that the syndromic surveillance system learned to focus on seriously ill people within the first 21 days of its operation (see the sharp rise in conversion rate during the first 21 days shown in Fig. 1), reaching a conversion rate of almost 6%. After this initial period, conversion rates fluctuate, but this overall slope is close to zero indicating that the advertising system could not significantly increase the conversion rate.During six months of deployment, the system was used by around 12,000 people of which 722 required urgent medical care. Although we do not have information on whether people who were urged to seek medical help did so, past work suggest that many would17. Future work may attempt to use geographic conversion mechanisms (e.g., a conversion which occurs if the user later appears within a healthcare facility) to directly optimize behavior change, similar to the work of Mohanty et al.22.Males were more likely to use the system and were more likely to be identified as having a serious illness. Though the system was used regardless of age and gender, young people were more likely to have serious illness. We attribute both findings to those populations being less likely to seek traditional medical attention23 and also to the fact that younger people feel more comfortable with an online diagnostic platform24,25. Interestingly, the campaign was utilized regardless of economic indicators, implying that people of different social strata were similarly likely to use the system. Additionally, Arab citizens were more likely to click on the campaign ads even though they were provided in Hebrew.The correlation of CTR and ConvR with pandemic indicators was similar, and was strongest at a lag of 8–9 days. Interestingly, the correlation was stronger with the hospitalization rate than with the number of cases. We attribute this to the implementation of the ad system’s conversion optimization mechanism which provided feedback to the ad system to focus on the most severe cases of COVID-19, according to users’ interactions with the Healthcare Bot. Thus, our results suggest an ability to focus on specific segments of the population, for example, those who are severely ill, helping them to reach treatment and assisting health authorities in predicting hospital loads at a significant lead time.The active syndromic surveillance described herein requires knowing that a particular pathogen is circulating in the population, that its symptoms can be recognized by people, and that there exists a clinical questionnaire that can give an indication that a person is ill with the relevant condition. The first limitation means that, unless a very general symptom questionnaire is used, the active syndromic surveillance system can only be implemented once a disease has been identified and a questionnaire for it is designed. The second limitation means that only diseases with external physical symptoms can be addressed. Nevertheless, it may be possible to create a general purpose questionnaire that identifies serious or unusual symptoms, thus creating a system which detects novel diseases appearing in the population, without predefining the specific illness that needs to be tracked, overcoming the first of the above-mentioned limitations.Our campaign was seen by up to approximately 2% of the population (some people may have seen the ads multiple times). A more wide-reaching campaign could have been seen by a larger portion of the population, thereby having a larger influence on the public’s behavior. A wider reach would have the benefit of helping more people reach a useful decision, but it might also reduce the lead time between measures of the ad system (CTR and ConvR) and pandemic indicators (cases and hospitalizations) as it would cause people to reach healthcare systems earlier. Notwithstanding this consideration, while search engines are by far the most widely used method for health-related searches26, not all segments of the population use the internet to the same extent. Therefore, active syndromic surveillance should not be the only method used to track a pandemic. Nevertheless, we believe that our system offers a novel and useful complement to other syndromic surveillance methods. ReferencesHenning, K. J. What is syndromic surveillance? Morb. Mortal.

Published: January 1, 2022 10:03 AM IST By India.com News Desk | Edited by Analiza Pathak Follow Us Israel Detects First Case of 'Florona', A Double Infection Of Covid-19 And Influenza: Report Jerusalem: Amid the ongoing pandemic of the Coronavirus across the globe, now Israel has recorded the first case of “Florona” disease, a double infection of COVID-19 and Influenza, said reports on Thursday. Meanwhile, Israel approved a fourth vaccine dose for people vulnerable to COVID-19 – making it one of the first countries to do so. Addressing a press conference on Thursday, director-general of the Health Ministry Nachman Ash announced the decision, informing that the doses will be administered first to people with weakened immune systems. “We will continue to track the data on a daily basis and we will see if we need to broaden this recommendation to more of the population,” he was quoted as saying by the Associated Press (AP). Israel began testing the fourth dose at the centre earlier this week, administering it to 150 medical staff who had already taken a booster shot in August. Almost a year ago, Israel was one of the first countries to roll out Pfizer’s vaccine and began administering booster doses last summer. However, the country still witnesses a large number of cases fuelled by the Delta variant of the virus and officials have warned of another surge in cases driven by the Omicron variant. COVID cases in Israel There are currently about 22,000 active patients in Israel, with over 90 of them in extremely serious conditions. The country has reported at least 8,243 fatalities from COVID-19 since the pandemic began. It should be noted here that last week, Chile announced that it would begin offering the fourth dose in February. Israel is one of the first countries to get Pfizer’s Paxlovid, a drug that can be used at home to prevent the virus’s most severe symptoms. All of the previously approved medications necessitate the use of an IV or injection. According to Israeli media, the first shipment contains 20,000 dosages, with more on the way as Pfizer ramps up manufacturing.
