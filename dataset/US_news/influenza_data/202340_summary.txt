- Seasonal influenza (the flu) is a common respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses.
- There are around a billion cases of seasonal influenza annually, with 3-5 million cases of severe illness and 290,000 to 650,000 respiratory deaths.
- Symptoms of influenza include fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, and fatigue.
- Vaccination is the best way to prevent the flu.
- Influenza viruses are categorized into types A, B, C, and D, with types A and B causing seasonal epidemics of disease.
- Influenza A viruses are further classified into subtypes based on surface proteins.
- Influenza B viruses belong to either the B/Yamagata or B/Victoria lineage.
- Influenza C virus is less common and causes mild infections.
- Influenza D viruses primarily affect cattle and do not cause illness in humans.
- Severe cases of influenza can lead to pneumonia and sepsis, and can worsen symptoms of other chronic diseases.
- Hospitalization and death due to influenza mainly occur among high-risk groups.
- Misinformation and conspiracy theories about the flu can impact vaccine coverage and public perception.
- Learning from past pandemics, such as the 1918 flu and COVID-19, can inform strategies for managing influenza spread.
- Correct treatment methods, including avoiding antibiotic misuse, are important for effective recovery from influenza.
- Public compliance with health measures, like social distancing and hygiene, is crucial in reducing flu transmission.
