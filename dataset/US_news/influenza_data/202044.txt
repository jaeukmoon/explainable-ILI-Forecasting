There are no effective pharmacological therapies that have been shown to improve outcomes for patients with ARDS. Although the host inflammatory response limits spread of and eventually clears the pathogen, immunopathology is a major contributor to tissue damage and ARDS1,2. Here we demonstrate that respiratory viral infection induces distinct fibroblast activation states, which we term extracellular matrix (ECM)-synthesizing, damage-responsive and interferon-responsive states. We provide evidence that excess activity of damage-responsive lung fibroblasts drives lethal immunopathology during severe influenza virus infection. By producing ECM-remodelling enzymes—in particular the ECM protease ADAMTS4—and inflammatory cytokines, damage-responsive fibroblasts modify the lung microenvironment to promote robust immune cell infiltration at the expense of lung function. In three cohorts of human participants, the levels of ADAMTS4 in the lower respiratory tract were associated with the severity of infection with seasonal or avian influenza virus. A therapeutic agent that targets the ECM protease activity of damage-responsive lung fibroblasts could provide a promising approach to preserving lung function and improving clinical outcomes following severe respiratory infections.

These infections can result in ARDS with pulmonary oedema and hypoxia, causing mild to severe respiratory failure1. Much of the lung damage induced by viral infection is a result of infiltrating immune cells, which kill infected and bystander cells4. Defining the mechanisms that alter the balance between pathogen clearance and immunopathology may enable identification of strategies to improve outcomes following ARDS2. Therapeutic targets include components of the lung ECM, which provides structural support that is critical for lung function and tissue-specific signals to coordinate immune responses5.The ECM consists of structural proteins as well as proteases and glycosidases that degrade or modify the ECM6. Upon lung injury, ECM proteases are upregulated and remodel the ECM, facilitating the migration of immune cells to sites of inflammation5,7. Non-immune lung cells, including epithelial cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts, coordinate immune responses and directly mediate lung function8. Through their remodelling activity, specific cell populations can influence the outcome of infection and long-term sequelae, as has been described for myofibroblasts and lung fibrosis9. The role of lung stromal cell populations in coordinating host responses to active respiratory infections has received less attention than their role in late-stage repair following pathogen clearance. While there is extensive literature on how immune cells regulate the host response to respiratory viral infection8, there is less information on the heterogeneity and role of non-haematopoietic cells.Stromal responses to influenza infectionWe sorted live, CD45− lung cells from mice 0, 1, 3 and 6 days after infection with influenza A virus and performed single-cell gene-expression profiling (scGEX) identifying three main populations: fibroblasts, epithelial cells and endothelial cells (Fig. 1a, b, Extended Data Fig. 1a, b). High levels of viral mRNA, indicative of productive infection, were detected primarily in type I pneumocytes, ciliated epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes (Extended Data Fig. 1c). Fibroblasts were particularly dynamic, with multiple transcriptional states emerging following infection (Fig. 1c, d, Extended Data Fig. 1d). To assess the pathways active in each cluster, we performed gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA), comparing each cluster to a putative baseline cluster (cluster 5) that was present before infection with few differentially expressed genes (Fig. 1c, Extended Data Fig. 2a). We identified three primary functional groups on the basis of gene expression: resting, ECM-synthesizing and inflammatory (Fig. 1c, Extended Data Fig. 2a). ECM-synthesizing fibroblasts (ESFibs) were enriched for genes encoding ECM structural proteins, but lacked inflammatory signatures (Fig. 1d, Extended Data Fig. 2a). Inflammatory fibroblasts exhibited high expression of genes involved in type I interferon, interleukin-6 (IL-6) or NF-κB signalling, whereas resting fibroblasts lacked strong enrichment for pathways involved in either inflammatory responses or synthesis of ECM proteins. (Fig. 1e, Extended Data Fig. 2a).Fig. 1: Single-cell gene-expression profiling of CD45− cells during severe influenza A virus infection.a, Schematic of sample collection for scGEX.

Data are mean ± s.e.m.Source dataFull size imageAmong inflammatory fibroblasts, we identified two distinct activation states, damage-responsive fibroblasts (DRFibs) and interferon-responsive fibroblasts (IRFibs) (Fig. 1d). DRFibs were enriched for pathways involved in tissue-damage responses, including NF-κB signalling and hypoxia, whereas IRFibs were enriched for type-I-interferon-responsive pathways (Fig. 1e, f, Extended Data Fig. 2b). Analysis of five human lung biopsies identified fibroblast activation states analogous to those defined in mouse lungs (Extended Data Fig. 2c) with clusters enriched for ECM synthesis, NF-κB signalling and type-I interferon signalling (Extended Data Fig. 2c, d).To validate these fibroblast activation states, we identified genes encoding surface-protein markers that were enriched in DRFibs and IRFibs in mouse and human lungs (Fig. 1f, Extended Data Figs. 2d, 3a, b). Upregulation of Itga5 and downregulation of Cd9 defined the DRFib transcriptional program, whereas upregulation of Bst2 and expression of Cd9 defined IRFibs (Fig. 1g, Extended Data Fig. 3a). In mice, DRFibs increased in frequency and number over the course of infection, reaching a peak around 12 days (Fig. 1g, h, Extended Data Fig. 3c, d). IRFibs emerged rapidly, by day 3, and gradually decreased in frequency (Fig. 1h). ITGA5hiCD9lo fibroblasts expressed high levels of DRFib signature genes (Lox and Adamts4), whereas ITGA5loCD9hi fibroblasts exhibited a resting phenotype, with low expression of infection-induced genes (Extended Data Fig. 3e, f). Primary lung fibroblasts stimulated with IL-1 and TNF, cytokines known to drive NF-κB signalling, acquired a surface phenotype with higher ITGA5 expression, indicative of a damage-responsive activation state (Extended Data Fig. 3g). Analysis of human lung biopsies identified fibroblasts that exhibited surface phenotypes similar to those in mouse lungs. Activated fibroblasts with a damage-responsive profile (ITGA5hiCD9lo) were present in donors who died of respiratory failure, but were noticeably absent from healthy donors (Extended Data Fig. 4a, b).Regulation of fibroblast activationWe next sought to identify the upstream stimuli that regulate fibroblast activation states. We tested whether in vitro infection of normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBEs) with human seasonal (H3N2) or avian viruses (H5N6 or H7N9) was sufficient to drive inflammatory transcriptional programs in human lung fibroblasts in co-culture (Fig. 2a). Infection of NHBEs induced expression in fibroblasts of genes enriched in inflammatory states, including genes encoding cytokines (IL6) and several matrix proteases (ADAMTS4, MMP3 and MMP13). We also tested the ability of individual cytokines and influenza viruses to stimulate these transcriptional programs in respiratory cells cultured on their own (Fig. 2a, monoculture), comparing them with nasal wash cells from patients infected with influenza virus, which comprise primarily immune cells10. These data demonstrated cell-type-specific expression of ECM-related genes (Extended Data Fig. 5a). In contrast to NHBEs, fibroblasts were highly responsive to stimulation with IL-1 cytokines and TNF, and ECM-related genes were broadly upregulated (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 5b, c). Nasal wash cells exhibited low levels of expression of ECM-related genes encoding both structural proteins and matrix proteases. However, nasal wash and epithelial cells also exhibited high levels of IL1A, IL1B and TNF expression, indicating that they probably provide immune signals to fibroblasts to regulate ECM-related gene expression (Extended Data Fig. 5a).Fig. 2: ADAMTS4 is a lung fibroblast-derived ECM protease induced by influenza virus infection.a, Average log2-transformed fold change in gene expression relative to mock-infected or mock-treated controls.

We assessed the regulation of ECM-related genes in mouse lung homogenates collected at different times during influenza virus infection (Fig. 2b). Detection of ECM proteases and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid corresponded with the kinetics of gene expression in lung homogenates (Extended Data Fig. 5d). Among the tested ECM proteases, the expression of ADAMTS4—one of the enzymes that degrade the proteoglycan versican11—was the earliest to be induced, and its expression continued throughout the repair stage (Fig. 2b). On the basis of scGEX analyses, expression of Adamts4 was restricted to non-immune, stromal cells (Fig. 2c). We next sorted immune and non-immune populations before and after infection. Before infection, Adamts4 gene expression was restricted to fibroblasts and endothelial cells. After infection, a significant upregulation of Adamts4 expression was observed only in fibroblasts, which we conclude account for the bulk of Adamts4 expression in infected lungs (Fig. 2d).To determine the specificity of ADAMTS4 gene expression in human lung disease, we performed a meta-analysis of publicly available scGEX datasets from seven studies of pulmonary fibrosis12,13,14, interstitial lung disease15, allergy and asthma16,17, and viral infection (with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2))18 (Extended Data Fig. 6 a). For reference, we included a study of rheumatoid arthritis, a disease driven by inflammatory fibroblasts19. ADAMTS4-positive cells included mesenchymal cells and endothelial cells, with a smaller number of epithelial and immune cells (Extended Data Fig. 6b, c). Fibroblasts with the highest levels of ADAMTS4 expression exhibited an activated phenotype with enriched expression of genes associated with DRFibs (Extended Data Fig. 6d). Analysis of a subset of data from a study by Habermann et al.12 indicated that expression of ADAMTS4 was markedly increased in inflammatory lung disease compared with healthy control tissue (Extended Data Fig. 6e). Mesenchymal cells expressed the highest levels of ADAMTS4 on a per-cell basis—at least an order of magnitude higher than other cell types, including endothelial cells (Extended Data Fig. 6f). Per-cell levels of ADAMTS4 were low in epithelial and immune cells and did not increase in diseased lungs compared to controls.To determine how fibroblast responses were organized anatomically, we performed spatial transcriptomics on mouse lung sections collected at the peak of respiratory distress (10 days post-infection (dpi)). Unsupervised clustering of transcriptional profiles identified areas of the lung (red, 0) that overlapped with regions of interstitial inflammation (Fig. 2e, Extended Data Fig. 7a). Genes associated with DRFibs, including Itga5, Lox and Adamts4, were enriched in these regions (Fig. 2e, Extended Data Fig. 7b–d). Adamts4 expression was restricted to areas of interstitial inflammation near the alveoli. Expression of DRFib-associated genes was reduced or absent from bronchial regions (green, 2), areas of dense lymphoid infiltration (teal, 3), and from areas of normal alveolar parenchyma (yellow, 1). Together, these data place DRFibs expressing Adamts4 in the distal airways at a critical inflection point when hosts either begin to recover or their condition worsens.ADAMTS4 promotes lethal immunopathologyTo determine the contribution of ADAMTS4 to infection outcome, we challenged Adamts4−/− and Adamts4+/+ mice with a lethal dose of influenza A virus. Adamts4−/− mice exhibited improved survival compared with Adamts4+/+ controls, independently of the viral burden in the lungs (Fig. 3a, b, Extended Data Fig. 8a, b). Neither the frequency nor total number of infected cells differed substantially between Adamts4−/− and Adamts4+/+ mice, although there were modest cell-type-specific differences (Extended Data Fig. 8c). In contrast to wild-type mice, Adamts4−/− mice were able to maintain lung function, as measured by arterial oxygen saturation, at 6 dpi (Fig. 3c). At 9 dpi, Adamts4−/− mice exhibited a significant decrease in immune cell infiltration and alveolar inflammation, with less extensive lung tissue damage (Fig. 3d). Consistent with reduced damage, Adamts4−/− mice had less total protein in BAL fluid compared with Adamts4+/+ controls and lower levels of key inflammatory mediators (TNF and MCP-1) in lung homogenates (Extended Data Fig. 8d, e). These differences in tissue damage translated to improved lung mechanics in Adamts4−/− mice, as measured by airway resistance and dynamic lung compliance (Fig. 3e, Extended Data Fig. 8f).Fig. 3: ADAMTS4 promotes lethal immunopathology during influenza A virus infection in mice.a, Survival curves following challenge with influenza A virus (Adamts4+/+ (WT), n = 33; Adamts4−/− (KO), n = 23; log-rank test, two-sided; data pooled from five independent experiments). b, Representative images of lung from infected mice and quantification of viral spread.

PBS, vehicle control (uncoated membrane). Unless otherwise indicated, data are pooled from two independent experiments. Data are mean ± s.e.m. Groups were compared using a two-sided Mann–Whitney U test.Source dataFull size imageWe examined the consequences of ADAMTS4 deficiency on the levels of versican, a major substrate of ADAMTS4. During inflammation, versican is an important component of the provisional matrix, a loose extracellular network that directs cell migration, proliferation and differentiation20; its function depends on its degradation state and interaction with other ECM proteins. Compared with wild-type mice, Adamts4−/− mice exhibited higher levels of intact versican in areas of lung remodelling after infection (Extended Data Fig. 9a, b). The levels of other known versicanases were not changed after infection in wild-type or Adamts4−/− mice (Extended Data Fig. 9c). As CD8+ T cells are one of the main drivers of immunopathology during infection with influenza A virus4,21, we assessed CD8+ T cell responses in the lungs at 9 dpi, the time point with peak T cell responses and lung damage. Adamts4−/− mice had a significantly lower percentage of IFNγ-producing CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3f, Extended Data Fig. 9d, e). The percentage of influenza A virus-specific CD8+ T cells did not differ between wild-type and Adamts4−/− mice, indicating that Adamts4−/− mice were able to mount influenza A virus-specific T cell responses similar to those of wild-type mice (Fig. 3g, Extended Data Fig. 9f). We observed significantly fewer T cells in lung sections of Adamts4−/− mice compared with Adamts4+/+ mice, with T cells being largely absent from areas with high intact versican (Fig. 3h). We next tested whether fibroblast-derived ADAMTS4 could promote T cell migration across a versican barrier (Fig. 3i). Activated CD8+ T cells migrated across uncoated and versican-coated membranes with nearly identical efficiency in the presence of ADAMTS4-sufficient fibroblasts. By contrast, migration across a versican-coated membrane was reduced by more than 40% in the presence of ADAMTS4-deficient fibroblasts. Consistent with DRFibs being the main producers of ADAMTS4, DRFibs promoted migration across a versican barrier, whereas migration was inhibited in the presence of resting fibroblasts and IRFibs (Fig. 3j), highlighting the distinct functions of the different fibroblast activation states.ADAMTS4 and severe influenza in humansWe next investigated the contribution of ADAMTS4 in the human respiratory tract to severe influenza virus infection in the Paediatric Intensive Care Influenza (PICFLU) network. We analysed samples of endotracheal aspirate (ETA) collected within 72 h of admission to intensive care from a multicentre cohort of 84 paediatric patients with influenza virus infection (Extended Data Fig. 10a). Levels of ECM proteases and TIMPs were analysed in the context of inflammatory mediators22. Controlling for age, ADAMTS4 was positively correlated with levels of IL-1B and TNF, which we identified as upstream regulators of ADAMTS4 expression, and with IFNγ, which was expressed at a higher frequency in CD8+ T cells in ADAMTS4 sufficient mice during influenza A virus infection (Fig. 4a). We next tested whether levels of ADAMTS4 in ETA were associated with the severity of influenza-related disease using three indicators: prolonged multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (PrMODS) or death, prolonged acute hypoxic respiratory failure (PrAHRF) or death, and fewer than ten ventilator-free days (VFDs) (Extended Data Fig. 10b). In each case, the log of the ADAMTS4 concentration was significantly associated with disease severity outcome after controlling for age, gender and baseline health status (PrMODS/death: odds ratio = 3.14, P = 0.003; PrAHRF/death: odds ratio = 2.27, P = 0.018; VFD < 10: odds ratio = 2.95, P = 0.027; Fig. 4b, Extended Data Fig. 10c).Fig. 4: ADAMTS4 levels are associated with severe seasonal and avian influenza infections.a, Correlation matrix of analytes for the PICFLU cohort.

Analytes are arranged by hierarchical clustering. b, Odds ratios for VFD < 10 with gender, previously healthy, age and steroid treatment as covariates.

Odds ratios in b, d determined using logistic regression with false-discovery rate adjustments for multiple testing; positive (red) or negative (blue) association.Full size imageTo determine whether these findings translated to adults, we analysed samples from two distinct, primarily adult cohorts: one from Taipei, representing moderate-to-severe cases of seasonal influenza (37 individuals) and one from Guangzhou, representing severe cases of H7N9 avian influenza (16 individuals) and seasonal H1N1 influenza (14 individuals) (Extended Data Fig. 10d). We tested samples from multiple respiratory compartments (ETA, sputum and BAL fluid). Individuals from the Taiwan cohort were sampled at a single time point after symptom onset, whereas most of those from the Guangzhou cohort were sampled at multiple time points.A correlation matrix of the same analytes indicated similar patterns of ECM protease, TIMP and cytokine regulation in the cohorts of primarily adult patients with influenza (Fig. 4c). We tested whether ADAMTS4 was associated with a particular respiratory compartment, including 131 nasal wash samples from the Taiwan cohort. ADAMTS4 was detectable at very low levels in 5% (6 out of 131) of nasal wash samples tested, but at higher frequencies and concentrations in each of the lower respiratory tract (LRT) compartments, suggesting that the source of ADAMTS4 is localized to the LRT during infection (Extended Data Fig. 10e).Finally, we tested whether ADAMTS4 is a predictor of disease severity during adult infection with influenza virus. To make the data comparable with the PICFLU cohort, we focused on the earliest available ETA sample, including only the first BAL fluid or sputum sample (in that order) when an ETA sample was not available. The log of the ADAMTS4 concentration was significantly associated with severity of disease, as determined by fewer than ten VFDs (odds ratio = 1.95, P = 0.020) (Fig. 4d). By combining samples from all three cohorts, the log of the ADAMTS4 concentration was associated with VFD values of less than ten, including age and gender as potential covariates (odds ratio = 2.22, P = 3.1 × 10−5) (Extended Data Fig. 10f). On the basis of these results, we propose that the level of ADAMTS4 protein in the LRT is a strong predictor of hypoxic respiratory failure and mortality following severe influenza virus infection across a wide range of ages.DiscussionSurviving a severe respiratory infection is dependent on a delicate balance between mounting a sufficient immune response to clear the infection and maintaining lung function despite immunity-induced tissue damage. Fibroblasts are located at the interface of the epithelial site of infection and the endothelial entry point of immune cells, well placed to integrate inflammatory signals and coordinate immune responses through modification of the local tissue environment23. In this study we provide evidence that lung fibroblasts are critical for coordinating immune responses at the site of viral infection in the tissue, starting soon after infection and continuing throughout the repair process. During infection, lung fibroblasts respond to damaged epithelial cells, transmit inflammatory signals and modify the ECM to generate a tissue environment that promotes robust immune responses to infection. Recent studies have described both protective24 and pathogenic25,26,27 roles for ECM proteases in the host response to influenza virus. Whereas these studies identified immune cells as the primary sources of ECM proteases, the data presented here indicate that inflammatory fibroblasts integrate danger signals from epithelial cells and resident immune cells to produce diverse inflammatory cytokines, ECM components and degradative enzymes that modify the local tissue environment. In mice, deficiency of ADAMTS4 activity in the lung preserves intact ECM-localized versican and modulates immune cell migration into areas of infection. Previous studies have indicated that intact versican is able to suppress cytotoxic T cell responses and inhibit migration24,28,29,30. Our data from studies with human participants suggest that ADAMTS4 is an important determinant of influenza disease severity across a wide age range. High ADAMTS4 concentrations in endotracheal samples from the paediatric cohort—collected soon after admission to intensive care—were strong predictors of PrAHRF and PrMODS, and in all cohorts, high ADAMTS4 concentrations in LRT samples were associated with fewer ventilator-free days. The role of ADAMTS4 in promoting excessive immunopathology also warrants further investigation in the context of other severe respiratory infections, including infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Understanding the basis for activation phenotypes in fibroblasts will be a critical future direction for these studies. Determining whether these are true differentiation lineages or if the cells can revert back to a resting state will require the development of precise lineage-tracing models. Currently, there are no effective therapeutic agents to treat severe complications of respiratory viral infections such as ARDS, and treatment is supportive1. We propose that targeting the ECM protease activity of damage-responsive fibroblasts could provide clinical benefits, by both limiting excessive inflammation and maintaining the integrity of lung tissue, and that ADAMTS4 activity may be a suitable target for therapeutic intervention.MethodsNo statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomized. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments. The investigators were blinded to outcome assessment in some experiments as indicated below.MiceB6.129P2-Adamts4tm1Dgen/J (Adamts4−/−) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories. These mice were backcrossed with C57BL/6J mice for at least 10 generations to generate congenic Adamts4−/− and Adamts4+/+ mice. Mice were housed at 68 °F, 12 h light/dark cycle and approximately 45% humidity.Studies involving mice were approved by the St Jude Children’s Research Hospital Committee on Care and Use of Animals. All mice that were tested in this study were bred and maintained at the St Jude Children’s Research Hospital under specific-pathogen free conditions.Single-cell RNA sequencingWhole lungs were collected from pathogen-free C57BL/6 mice (Taconic Biosciences) at 0, 1, 3, 6 and 21 days after initial infection. Four or five mice for each time point were infected with 2500 EID50 of mouse-adapted influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) virus intranasally in 30 μl of 1× PBS31. Lungs were perfused with 10 ml cold 1× PBS injected into the right ventricle of the heart and then minced and digested in lung digestion buffer containing 400 U ml−1 collagenase I (Worthington Biochemical Corporation) and 50 U ml−1 of DNaseI (ThermoFisher) in Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS) for 75 min at 37 °C. Digested lungs were filtered through a 100-μm cell strainer and washed with HBSS. Red blood cell were lysed and resuspended at 1 × 106 cells per ml. Cells were incubated with Ghost Dye Violet 510 (Tonbo) (1:100 dilution) and APC anti-mouse CD45.2 (clone 104, Biolegend) (1:100 dilution) for 30 min at room temperature. Live, CD45− cells were sorted into 1.7-ml microfuge tubes and then centrifuged at 400g for 5 min. Cells were then incubated with PE-conjugated anti-mouse H-2 antibody (1:100, clone M1/42, Biolegend) for 30 min on ice.Human lung biopsy samples from de-identified, deceased patients were obtained through the National Disease Research Interchange (NDRI). Cause of death of these patients was unrelated to respiratory tract infection or lung damage, and they did not have a history of tobacco use or lung cancer. Fresh 5 cm × 5 cm × 5 cm lung biopsy samples were minced and digested in 400 U ml−1 of collagenase I (Worthington Biochemical Corporation) and 50 U ml−1 of DNaseI (ThermoFisher) in HBSS for 90 min at 37 °C. Lung samples were first filtered through sterile gauze and then through a 100-μm cell strainer and washed with HBSS, then red blood cell lysis was performed. Single-cell suspensions of total lung cells were frozen in freeze medium (90% FBS, 10% DMSO) at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells per ml. For single-cell RNA sequencing using 10X Genomics, vials of cells were thawed and incubated with Ghost Dye Violet 510 (Tonbo) (1:100 dilution) and APC anti-human CD45 (1:200) for 30 min at room temperature. Live, CD45− cells and live, CD45+ cells were sorted into 1.7-ml microfuge tubes and then centrifuged at 400g for 5 min. Following sorting, cells were incubated with PE anti-human β2 microglobulin (1:100) and PE anti-human CD45 (1:100) antibodies for 30 min on ice.For both mouse and human lung samples, cells were washed three times and then incubated with custom-designed hashtag oligos (HTO) conjugated to anti-PE antibodies (Thunder-Link PLUS Oligo Conjugation System, Expedeon), unique for each individual mouse. After incubation, cells were washed three times and then pooled within each time point. Approximately 25,000 cells per sample were loaded onto the Chromium controller (10X Genomics) to partition single cells into gel beads. Single-cell transcriptomic libraries were generated using the 5′ Gene Expression Kit (V2, 10X Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with the addition of primers to amplify HTOs during cDNA amplification. Sequencing was performed on the Illumina NovaSeq to generate approximately 500 million reads per sample.Single-cell gene-expression analysesThe 10X gene-expression data were first processed using CellRanger (v.3.0.2, 10X Genomics). Human data were processed using version 3.0.0 of the GRCh38 10X reference, whereas mouse data were processed using the mm10 reference altered to include the PR8 influenza genome. CellRanger was then used to aggregate species-specific samples, normalizing by the number of mapped reads per identified cell. Normalized feature-barcode matrices including both gene expression and HTO counts were then imported into Seurat (v.3.0.0.900) for downstream analysis32.Data were first filtered by excluding any gene that was not present in at least 0.1% of total called cells and then by excluding cells that exhibited extremes in the species-specific distributions of: the number of genes expressed (mouse: <100 or >5,550; human: <100 or >4,500), the number of mRNA molecules (mouse: >30,000; human: >20,000), or the percentage of expression owed to mitochondrial genes (mouse and human: >7.5%). Gene-expression counts were log-normalized using a scaling factor of 1 × 104, variable features targeted for downstream analysis were identified using the ‘vst’ method with default parameters, and cell-cycle scores were generated for each cell using markers identified elsewhere33. Gene expression was then scaled to regress out the effects of total transcript expression, percent of mitochondrial expression, and cell cycle scores. For first-pass analyses of entire datasets, we selected principal components (PCs) visually using an elbow plot of the PC standard deviations (mouse: 25; human: 19). These PCs were then used for t-SNE dimensionality reduction and cell clustering with Seurat’s shared-nearest-neighbour modularity algorithm to broadly characterize the cell types in the entirety of each sample. Individual cell subsets were annotated using known markers from the literature.For more detailed analyses of fibroblast differentiation states, we generated a subset of the identified fibroblast clusters, identified the top variable features within this subset, and re-scaled those data as described above. For the mouse fibroblast data, we also regressed out the effects of days post infection to more precisely characterize the variance among fibroblast clusters and distinguish cellular responses to experimental infection. After repeating principal component analysis, principal components were scored for significance (false-discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P < 0.05) using random permutations as implemented in Seurat. Differential gene expression was assessed among clusters for all genes expressed in at least 1% of cells within a cluster using a generalized linear hurdle model that incorporates both expression frequency and abundance34. For pairwise cluster comparisons of interest, genes were then ranked as a function of the product of their average log fold change, the absolute value of the difference in percent expression, and the inverse of the scaled, FDR-adjusted P value. These gene-rank lists were then analysed using preranked GSEA35.Meta-analysis of publicly available human single-cell gene-expression datasetsHuman single-cell gene-expression data from published reports (Extended Data Fig. 6a) were obtained from online data repositories. From ref. 17 we were only able to obtain data from four healthy controls, as other data, including the data from patients with asthma, were not publicly available. Each dataset was filtered to exclude cells with more than 20% mitochondrial content, fewer than 200 genes, or fewer than 200 RNA molecules before being normalized, scaled, and assessed for variable features using the SCTransform wrapper in Seurat32. Focal analyses of specific datasets were conducted on these resulting data objects. We also compiled the datasets for meta-analysis using reference-based integration with 3,000 integration features, with data from ref. 12 as the reference, again using the SCTransform normalization method. Downstream analyses were focused on the subset of cells that contained at least one ADAMTS4 transcript. Dimensionality reduction and clustering were conducted as described previously, but in this case using the integration assay. Differential gene-expression analyses were conducted on the RNA assay of the integrated object using default parameters in Seurat.Flow cytometry for lung stromal cells and FACSAt the indicated time point after infection, lungs were perfused with 10 ml cold 1× PBS injecting into the right ventricle of the heart and then minced and digested in lung digestion buffer containing 400 U ml−1 of collagenase I (Worthington Biochemical Corporation) and 50 U ml−1 of DNaseI (ThermoFisher) in HBSS for 30 min at 37 °C. Digested lungs were filtered through a 100-μm cell strainer and washed with HBSS. Red blood cell lysis was performed, and cells were washed and resuspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (1% FBS and 2 mM EDTA in 1× PBS). CD45+ cells were depleted using mouse CD45 Microbeads (Miltenyi) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, cells were incubated with microbeads for 15 min on ice, washed with FACS buffer, and resuspended in 500 μl of buffer. CD45+ cells were then depleted using a Miltenyi LS column, and the flow through (CD45− cells) were collected. For antibody staining, 1 × 106 cells were plated and then incubated with Fc block for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed one time with FACS buffer and then resuspended in 100 μl of an antibody cocktail containing the following: Ghost Dye Violet 510 (1:100), BV605 anti-mouse CD45 (1:200), BV421 anti-mouse EpCAM (1:200), PerCP/Cy5.5 anti-mouse CD31 (1:200), FITC anti-mouse BST2 (1:100), PE anti-mouse CD9 (1:100) and APC anti-mouse CD49e (1:100). Cells were incubated with the antibody cocktail for 30 min at room temperature and then washed twice with FACS buffer before resuspending in a final volume of 150 μl. For single-cell suspensions from human lung biopsy samples, cells were washed one time with FACS buffer and then resuspended in 100 μl of an antibody cocktail containing the following: Ghost Dye Violet 510 (1:100), BV605 anti-human CD45 (1:100), BV785 anti-human EpCAM (1:100), APC Fire 750 anti-human CD31 (1:100), PE/Cy7 anti-human CD140a (1:100), APC anti-human CD49e (1:100) and PE anti-human CD9 (1:100). Cells were incubated with the antibody cocktail for 30 min at room temperature and then washed twice with FAC buffer before resuspending in a final volume of 150 μl. Cells were analysed using a BD LSRII Fortessa and BD FACSDIVA software (Becton Dickinson). Data were analysed using FlowJo software (FlowJo).High-throughput quantitative PCRFor in vitro stimulation of primary mouse lung fibroblasts, fibroblasts were isolated from C57BL6/J. Lungs were collected, minced, and then digested in lung digestion buffer containing 0.1% collagenase I (Worthington Biochemical Corporation) and 2.4 U ml−1 dispase (Thermo Fisher) for 90 min at 37 °C. Digested lungs were filtered through a 100-μm cell strainer and then washed with 15 ml of 0.05 M EDTA in 1× PBS. Cells were centrifuged at 400g for 10 min and then resuspended in complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (cDMEM) and plated in a T75 tissue-culture flask (Corning). For cytokine and virus stimulations, 2 × 105 cells were plated in each well of a 24-well plate 24 h before stimulation. Fibroblasts were stimulated with the following mouse cytokines: IL-1B (10 ng ml−1), IL-1A (10 ng ml−1), IL-33 (10 ng ml−1), IL-18 (10 ng ml−1), TNF (200 ng ml−1), IFNα (1,000 U ml−1), IL-6 (40 ng ml−1), TGFβ (2 ng ml−1), IL-17A (50 ng ml−1), IL-27 (50 ng ml−1), and GM-CSF (40 ng ml−1). For the virus stimulations, cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2. Virus inoculum was incubated with the cells for 1 h at 37 °C. The following influenza viruses were used for the stimulations: A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8), A/California/04/2009 (CA09) and A/Perth/16/09 (Perth). The supernatant was removed, and cells were washed three times with cDMEM. The wells were replenished with 1 ml of cDMEM, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. To collect BAL fluid, a catheter was inserted into the trachea, and 3 ml of 1× PBS was used to wash the lungs. BAL fluid was centrifuged at 400g for 5 min to pellet cells, and then the cells were resuspended in 350 μl Trizol reagent.For co-culture experiments, normal human lung fibroblasts (Lonza) were plated at a density of 2,500 cells per cm2 in the basal chamber of a 24-well plate and cultured in fibroblast growth medium (Lonza) overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2. NHBEs were seeded at a density of 10,000 cells per cm2 in 12-mm Transwell inserts (Corning) coated with human placental collagen and then added to plates containing fibroblasts. Co-cultures were cultured in bronchial epithelial growth medium (BEGM) (Lonza) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 7–10 days. Co-cultures were then taken to the air–liquid interface and basolateral medium was exchanged for medium consisting of 50% DMEM and 50% BEGM supplemented with the BEGM BulletKit (Lonza). Medium was changed every 2–3 days until the cells were fully differentiated (2–3 weeks). For infections, NHBEs were inoculated at a MOI of 2 using the following influenza A virus strains: H3N2 A/Perth/16/09, H5N6 A/Oriental Magpie Robin/Hong Kong/6154/2015, and H7N9 A/Hong Kong/125/2017. Infections with avian strains were performed in an ABSL3+ facility.For monoculture experiments, NHBEs from a single donor were plated in 24-well Transwell plates (Corning) and cultured in bronchial epithelial basal medium (BEBM) (Lonza) supplemented with bovine pituitary extract, insulin, hydrocortisone, gentamicin-amphotericin, transferrin, triiodothyronine, epinephrine, epidermal growth factor and retinoic acid until wells were confluent and cells formed tight junctions. Supernatant was then removed from the apical side of the Transwell and cells were taken into the air–liquid interface for 2–3 weeks. NHBEs were then stimulated with the following human cytokines adding each factor to medium in the basal chamber: IL-1B (10 ng ml−1), IL-1A (10 ng ml−1), IL-33 (10 ng ml−1), IL-18 (10 ng ml−1), TNF (200 ng ml−1), IFNα (1,000 U ml−1), IL-6 (40 ng ml−1), TGF-β (2 ng ml−1), IL-17A (50 ng ml−1), IL-27 (50 ng ml−1), and GM-CSF (40 ng ml−1). For virus stimulations, cells were infected at an MOI of 2. Virus inoculum was incubated with the cells in the apical chamber for 1 h at 37 °C. The supernatant was removed, and cells were washed three times with BEBM, and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Normal human bronchial fibroblasts (NHBFs) (Matek) were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells per well and cultured in cDMEM. NHBFs were stimulated with the cytokines and viruses listed above. Following incubation, the supernatant was removed and cells were collected in 350 μl Trizol Reagent (Thermo Fisher). RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen) were then used to isolate RNA from the samples according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Following RNA isolation, the amount of RNA input was normalized (200 ng), and cDNA was generated using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Biorad). cDNA was then prepared for quantitative PCR (qPCR) using the Fluidigm Biomark (Fluidigm). Data were collected using the Fluidigm Biomark data collection software (Fluidigm). Exon-spanning qPCR primers were designed to target a panel of 96 ECM-related genes for humans (Supplementary Table 1) and mice (Supplementary Table 2).For whole lung homogenates from mice, lungs were collected at 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 30 and 40 days after infection. C57BL6/J mice were infected with 2500 EID50 PR8. Whole lungs were dissected and homogenized in 750 μl Trizol reagent using the TissueLyser II (Qiagen). RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer’s protocol.Spatial transcriptomicsC57BL/6J (Jackson Laboratories) were infected intranasally with 2,500 50% egg infective dose (EID50) of influenza A virus PR8 in 30 μl of 1× PBS. Lungs were dissected from the mice 10 days after infection. Sections obtained from four distinct mice were imaged and processed for spatially resolved gene expression using the Visium Spatial Transcriptomics kit (10x Genomics). Lungs were inflated with 300 μl of 50% OCT and 50% PBS v/v and immediately snap-frozen in OCT using isopentane that was cooled in a liquid nitrogen bath. For each lung, the same left lobe was collected and stored at −80 °C until cryosectioning. For cryosectioning, samples were equilibrated to −22 °C. Exploratory sections were stained with a fluorescent lectin and DAPI to determine areas of immune infiltration and remodelling, and then blocks were trimmed to 5 × 5 mm to encompass normal and remodelled areas before sectioning directly onto the spatial transcriptomics kit slide. Tissue permeabilization was optimized at 12 min on independent lung sections. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq platform at 28 × 120 base pairs, and resulting data were processed using SpaceRanger (v.1.0.0, 10X Genomics) with manual alignment of fiducial markers, manual tissue identification, and r2-length trimmed to 91 base pairs. Downstream analyses were conducted with Seurat (v.3.1.4.9901)32.Adamts4 −/− and Adamts4 +/+ survival experimentsMice were anaesthetized with 2,2,2-tribromoethanol by intraperitoneal injection and infected intranasally with 6,000 EID50 of PR8 in 30 μl 1× PBS. Following infection, mice were monitored twice daily and their weight was recorded. Mice were euthanized if they become severely moribund based on body index score and substantial weight loss31. Righting reflex of severely moribund mice was assessed to determine whether immediate euthanasia was necessary. Mice that lost more than 20% of their body weight were placed on their backs, and if unable to right themselves within 10 s, were euthanized. Mice were identified by ear tag numbers, and investigators assessing morbidity were blinded to the genotype.Plaque titresBAL fluid was used to obtain viral titres inoculating Madin–Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells. MDCKs were obtained from and authenticated by the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The cells were not tested for mycoplasma contamination. MDCKs were plated in 6-well tissue culture plates at a density of 4 × 105 cells per well. Twenty-four hours after plating, cells were washed three times with 1× PBS and then incubated with 1 ml of BAL fluid, after six tenfold dilutions in serum-free MEM. Cells were incubated with inoculum for 10 min at 4 °C and then for 50 min at 37 °C. Inoculum was removed and 3 ml of MEM containing 0.9% agarose and of trypsin containing 1 mg ml−1 TPCK was overlaid onto the cell monolayer. Plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 72 h, and then plaques were counted after staining the cells with crystal violet.Pulse oximetryMice were inoculated intranasally with 6,000 EID50 of influenza A virus (IAV) PR8 and arterial oxygen saturation was measured using the MouseOx system (STARR Life Sciences). Following infection, fur was removed around the neck of the mouse, and arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) was measured using a throat collar sensor. After acclimatization, oxygen saturation measurements were recorded for 3 min, and measurements were averaged over the measurement period.Histology and morphometry viral-spread analysisLungs were dissected at 3 and 6 days after infection with 2,500 EID50 of PR8. Lungs were inflated with 1 ml of 10% neutral-buffered formalin, and then placed in a 15-ml conical tube containing a further 3 ml of formalin. Lungs were incubated in formalin at room temperature for at least 72 h to ensure complete fixation of the tissue. Lungs were embedded in paraffin blocks and then sectioned onto glass slides. Serial tissue sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin for histology. Immunohistochemical labelling of viral antigen was completed by using a primary goat polyclonal antibody (US Biological) against influenza A, USSR (H1N1) at 1:1,000 and a secondary biotinylated donkey anti-goat antibody (sc-2042; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:200 on tissue sections subjected to antigen retrieval for 30 min at 98 °C. The extent of virus spread was quantified by first capturing digital images of whole-lung sections stained for viral antigen using an Aperio ScanScope XT Slide Scanner (Aperio Technologies) and then manually outlining fields with the alveolar areas containing virus antigen-positive pneumocytes. The percentage of each lung field with infection/lesions was calculated using the Aperio ImageScope software. For histologic grading of lesions, a pathologist blinded to treatment group identity evaluated pulmonary lesions in haematoxylin and eosin-stained histologic sections and assigned scores on the basis of their severity and extent as follows: 0, no lesions; 1, minimal, focal to multifocal, barely detectable; 15, mild, multifocal, small but conspicuous; 40, moderate, multifocal, prominent; 80, marked, multifocal coalescing, lobar; 100, severe, diffuse, with extensive disruption of normal architecture and function.Assessment of IAV-infected cells by flow cytometryLungs were perfused with 10 ml cold 1× PBS injected into the right ventricle of the heart and then minced and digested in lung digestion buffer containing 400 U ml−1 collagenase I (Worthington Biochemical Corporation) and 50 U/ml of DNaseI (ThermoFisher) in HBSS for 30 min at 37 °C. Digested lungs were filtered through a 100-μm cell strainer and washed with HBSS. Red blood cell lysis was performed, and cells were washed and resuspended in FACS buffer. Cells were washed and then incubated with Trustain FcX anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (Fc Block) at a dilution of 1:100 for 10 min at room temperature. For surface staining, cells were then washed and incubated in 100 μl of FACS buffer (1% FBS, 1 mM EDTA in 1× PBS) containing Ghost Dye Violet 510 (1:100), PE/Cy7 anti-mouse CD45.2 (1:200), PacBlue anti-mouse CD11c (1:100), APC/Cy7 anti-mouse CD11b (1:100), BV650 anti-mouse Gr-1 (1:200), APC anti-mouse CD326 (EpCAM) (1:100), PE anti-mouse CD90.2 (1:100), PerCP/Cy5.5 anti-mouse CD31 (1:100) for 30 min at room temperature. For intracellular staining, cells were fixed and membranes permeabilized by incubating in 100 μl fixation–permeabilization solution (BD Biosciences) for 20 min on ice. Cells were washed with permeabilization buffer and then incubated with FITC anti-influenza A (1:100).Assessment of CD8+ T cell responsesIn order to assess immune cell populations by flow cytometry, whole lungs were dissected, minced, and incubated with spleen dissociation medium (STEMCELL) for 30 min at 37 °C. Red blood cell lysis was performed, and cells were washed with HBSS and counted using a Vi-CELL XR cell counter (Beckman Coulter). For ex vivo stimulation and intracellular cytokine staining, 1 × 106 total lung cells were plated in a 96-well plate for each condition. Cells were stimulated with Cell Stimulation Cocktail (Biolegend), containing PMA, ionomycin and brefeldin A, at a dilution of 1:500 or with influenza peptides at a concentration of 1 μM for 4 h. Following stimulation, cells were washed and then incubated with Trustain FcX anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (Fc Block) at a dilution of 1:100 for 10 min at room temperature. For surface staining, cells were then washed and incubated in 100 μl FACS buffer (1% FBS, 1 mM EDTA in 1× PBS) containing Live/Dead Aqua (1:100), APC anti-mouse CD45.2 (1:100), FITC anti-mouse CD3 (1:100), BV650 anti-mouse CD8 (1:200) and APC/Cy7 anti-mouse CD4 (1:200) for 30 min at room temperature. For intracellular staining, cells were fixed and membranes permeabilized by incubating in 100 μl fixation–permeabilization solution (BD Biosciences) for 20 min on ice. Cells were washed with permeabilization buffer and then incubated with PE/Cy7 anti-mouse IFNγ (1:100) for 30 min on ice.For IAV peptide:MHC tetramer staining, 1 × 106 total lung cells were plated in a 96-well plate for each sample. Cells were incubated with APC PB1 (residues 703–711) tetramer (1:750), PE PA (residues 224–233) tetramer (1:750), and BV785 NP (residues 366–374) tetramer (1:250) for 1 h on ice. Then, cells were surface stained with FITC anti-mouse CD3 (1:100), BV650 anti-mouse CD8 (1:200), APC/Cy7 anti-mouse CD4 (1:200) for 30 min on ice.Lung tissue immunofluorescenceLungs were dissected 9 days after infection with 2,500 EID50 of PR8. Lungs were inflated with 1 ml fixative containing 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% DMSO and then transferred to a 15 ml conical tube containing 3 ml of fixative for 24 h before cryoprotection with 30% sucrose in PBS for an additional 24 h. Tissues were cryosectioned at 10 μm thickness and blocked in buffer comprised of PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 5% donkey serum. Tissues were stained overnight in blocking buffer containing 4 μg ml−1 rat anti-CD3 (Biolegend, clone 17A2) and 4 μg ml−1 rabbit anti-mouse versican GAG beta domain (Millipore Sigma, AB1033). Sections were washed in PBS before incubation with CF488-conjugated donkey anti-rat IgG (Biotium, 20027, lot 16C0301, 2 μg ml−1), CF568-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Biotium, 20098, lot 19C0110, 2 μg ml−1) and 10 μM DAPI for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were washed with PBS and mounted with Prolong Diamond Hardset Mounting Medium (ThermoFisher). High-resolution images were acquired using a Marianis spinning disk confocal microscope (Intelligent Imaging Innovations) equipped with a 40× 1.3NA Plan-Neofluar objective, 405-nm, 488-nm and 561-nm laser lines and Prime 95B CMOS camera (Photometrics), and analysed using Slidebook software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations). For quantification of CD3+ cells, 3–4 fields of view in the areas of tissue remodelling were collected for each lung.Lung function testFor lung function studies, mice were infected with 2,500 EID50 of PR8. At 10 dpi, mice were anaesthetized with 2,2,2-tribromoethanol by intraperitoneal injection and a tracheal tube was inserted. Airway resistance and dynamic lung compliance were measured using the Buxco Finepointe Resistance and Compliance system (Data Sciences International). Data were collected using Buxco Finepointe software (Data Sciences International). Mice were mechanically ventilated at a rate of 140 breaths per minute. Five methacholine challenges were performed at doses of 1.5625, 3.125, 6.25, 12.5 and 25 mg ml−1, administering the methacholine in 0.010 ml PBS. Following each methacholine challenge, resistance and compliance were measured for 3 min allowing the mice to recover for 1 min after each measurement. Measurements for resistance and compliance were averaged over the 3 min measurement period for each methacholine challenge and baseline measurements.T cell migration assaysFor migration assays, CD8+ T cells were isolated from spleens of C57BL/6J mice. To enrich for CD8+ T cells, samples were magnetically depleted using a cocktail of the following biotinylated antibodies: anti-mouse B220 (1:50), anti-mouse MHC class II (1:50), anti-mouse CD11b (1:100), anti-mouse CD49b (1:200), and anti-mouse CD4 (1:100). Up to 109 total spleen cells were incubated with the antibody cocktail for 15 min on ice. Cells were washed with FACS buffer and then incubated with Miltenyi Streptavidin microbeads (1:25) for 15 min on ice. The cells were centrifuged at 500g for 5 min and then resuspended in 1 ml FACS buffer. The sample was added to a pre-equilibrated Miltenyi LS column and the flow-through enriched by CD8+ T cells was collected. CD8+ T cells were then activated with anti-mouse CD3e (1 μg ml−1) and anti-mouse CD28 (3 μg ml−1) antibodies in complete RPMI at 37 °C for 72 h. Forty-eight hours before the migration assay, primary mouse lung fibroblasts, which were plated at a concentration of 105 cells per well in a 24-well plate the previous night, were stimulated with IL-1B (10 ng ml−1) and TNF (200 ng ml−1). For activation states (resting, DRFib, IRFib), sorted fibroblasts were plated at a density of 104 cells per well 48 h before the migration assay. 6.5 mm polycarbonate Transwell inserts with 8.0-μm pore size (Corning) were coated with 10 μg ml−1 versican purified from bovine aorta29 for 2 h at 37 °C. Versican was aspirated and Transwell inserts were transferred to the 24-well plate with stimulated fibroblasts. To test migration, 105 activated CD8+ T cells were added to the apical chamber of the Transwell in a volume of 100 μl complete DMEM. Cells were allowed to migrate to the basal chamber for 4 h at 37 °C. After 4 h, supernatants from the basal chamber were collected and the number of lymphocytes were manually counted.Quantification of proteins in mouse lung homogenates and bronchoalveolar lavage fluidCytokine levels in lung tissue homogenates were measured using LEGENDplex cytokine bead arrays (Biolegend). Lungs were dissected from PR8-infected mice at 6 dpi and homogenized in 500 μl of PBS. Homogenized lung samples were centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 10 min, and 25 μl of undiluted supernatant was tested in the assay. The assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.BAL washes were performed using 500 μl of PBS. Matrix protease levels in mouse BAL fluid were quantified using ELISA or a multiplexed, Luminex-based fluorescent assay. A custom Luminex kit (R&D Systems) was used to assay the following analytes: MMP-2, MMP-8, MMP-9, MMP-12, TIMP-1 and TIMP-4. Duoset ELISA kits (R&D Systems) were used to assay the following analytes: ADAMTS4, MMP-3, MMP-13, and TIMP-3.Human cohortsFor the PICFLU cohort, the study was approved by the lead site Boston Children’s Hospital (IRB X08-11-0534) and then at each enrolling site’s IRB (enrolling sites are listed in acknowledgements) and written informed consent was obtained from at least one parent or guardian. Patients were excluded before enrolment if they had an underlying condition predisposing them to severe influenza infection as has been described previously36,37. Additional cohort information is presented in Extended Data Fig. 10a. Endotracheal aspirate samples were obtained using standardized methods with 1.5 ml of sterile normal saline down the endotracheal tube then 3–4 breaths before obtaining the sample with 2 suctioning attempts aiming to collect at least 2 ml of aspirate. The sample was put on ice and transferred immediately to the laboratory for processing. One aliquot was immediately frozen (−80 °C) and the rest was centrifuged. The supernatant was aliquoted and frozen at −80 °C.For the Guangzhou cohort, the study was approved by the ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University (no: 2016-78), and informed consent was obtained from all patients or their guardians. Additional cohort information is presented in Extended Data Fig. 10c.For the Taiwan cohort, the human participants’ protocol was reviewed and approved by the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital Institutional Review Boards (IRB00091667). Informed consent was obtained from all patients or their guardians. This protocol allowed for the collection of residual BAL and sputum samples that were initially collected for clinical purposes from patients with influenza (Extended Data Fig. 10c).For lung samples from de-identified, deceased donors, the tissues used were procured by the NDRI with support from NIH grant U42OD11158. All NDRI consent forms and protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Pennsylvania. Research involving these tissues was determined to not involve human participants by the Institutional Review Board at St Jude Children’s Research Hospital.Quantification of matrix protease and cytokine/chemokine protein levels in human samplesCytokine and chemokine levels were measured using Milliplex Human Cytokine/Chemokine Magnetic Bead Panel—Premixed 41 plex. MMP and TIMP protein levels were quantified using the following Milliplex bead-based multiplexed assay: Human MMP Magnetic Bead Panel 1 (MMP-3, MMP-12, MMP-13), Human MMP Magnetic Bead Panel 2 (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-7, MMP-9, MMP-10) and Human TIMP Magnetic Bead Panel 2 (TIMP-1, TIMP-2, TIMP-3, TIMP-4). ADAMTS4 and ADAMTS5 were measured using Duoset ELISA kits (R&D Systems).Cytokine correlation matricesCorrelation matrices were generated using samples analysed in severity analyses, with log10-transformed cytokine levels. To control for potential effects of age and day of sample collection (days after symptom onset), we computed partial pairwise Spearman correlations and assessed their statistical significance using the R psych package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/psych/index.html). Correlations were visualized using the R corrplot package (https://github.com/cran/corrplot/blob/master/R/corrplot.R), and correlations with P < 0.05 after FDR adjustment were excluded.Severity analysesFor analysis of association of ADAMTS4 levels with severity of infection in the PICFlu cohort, we used three distinct indicators of severity: PrMODS or death, PrAHRF or death, and VFDs less than 10. In survivors, ‘prolonged’ was defined as being present on or after day 7 of admission to paediatric intensive care or being on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation on or after day 7. PrAHRF was defined as partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio less than 200 and mechanical ventilator support, which are criteria for moderate-severe ARDS1. VFDs were defined as days alive and free of invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation up to 28 days38. Owing to the bimodal distribution of VFDs, we used a cut-off of 10 VFDs to classify cases as severe (Extended Data Fig. 10b) ADAMTS4 was modelled as a predictor of these categorical outcomes using logistic regressions in R that explicitly included gender, age, baseline health (‘previously healthy’), and steroid administration. FDR adjustments for multiple testing were applied independently to each model. Patients were considered ‘previously healthy’ if they were, upon admission, otherwise healthy, on no prescription medications, without underlying medical conditions, and not dependent on any medical devices before initial admission to the hospital for flu. No violations of the model assumptions were found in any reported results after specifically checking for: (1) the assumption that the relationship between continuous predictor variables and the logit of the outcome is linear, (2) evidence of extreme values in continuous predictors (as indicated by standard residuals with an absolute value over three), and (3) evidence of multicollinearity among variables (as indicated by variance inflation factors (VIFs)). Odds ratios were visualized using the sjPlot package in R (https://strengejacke.github.io/sjPlot/).Sequence data used for analysesHallmark gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database were used for GSEA (https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp).

It might also shield some people from a severe case of COVID-19 — even though the infection is caused by an entirely different virus. People who received a flu vaccination in the year before testing positive for the novel coronavirus were nearly two-and-a-half times less likely to be hospitalized for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, than those who were unvaccinated, an analysis of patient data by University of Florida Health researchers has found. And those with a flu vaccination were more than three times less likely to be admitted to an intensive care unit. The effect could be the result of a general priming of the immune system that boosts the body’s readiness to attack, no matter the invader. “This would actually be a pretty easy way of keeping some people out of the hospital and out of the ICU,” said Arch G. Mainous III, Ph.D., the study’s senior author and a professor in the department of health services research, management and policy at the UF College of Public Health and Health Professions. The study, which the researchers believe is the first peer-reviewed investigation to document this protective effect, examined de-identified information for the 2,000 patients at UF Health who tested positive for COVID-19 between March and August. The researchers said more investigation is needed to confirm this association. They said it is important to note the limitations of their work, including that it involved just one medical center. So, it’s unclear if results would also be seen in patients across the nation. Additionally, the number of vaccinated patients in the group studied is relatively low — 10.7% of the total, or 214 people. However, all of the data, including COVID-19 tests, hospitalizations, ICU admissions and influenza vaccination status, come from the patients’ electronic health record and not surveys of patients. Numbers were adjusted for age, ethnicity and comorbidities, such as diabetes, obesity and other chronic illnesses that can increase the severity of COVID-19. “We think this gives people a huge incentive to get a vaccination. It’s a double-win in many ways because the vaccination is, of course, helping protect you from influenza as well,” said Mainous, also vice chair for research in the UF College of Medicine’s department of community health and family medicine. Nothing in the study, however, should be construed as suggesting COVID-19 is identical to flu — COVID-19 is still more lethal than influenza and a far more serious public health concern, Mainous said. The lead author of the study, published today in the Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine, is Ming-Jim Yang, M.D., a third-year resident in family medicine at UF Health. “People who were vaccinated seem to be more protected,” Yang said. “Many of them seem to be able to avoid hospitalization. And when they are hospitalized, fewer of them are being upgraded to the intensive care unit. We were pleasantly surprised by the results.” Mainous and Yang said the findings potentially have important implications for defending patients against a disease with few proven effective treatments. Yang noted this protective effect appears to be present even in the absence of actual flu infection. Why the vaccination might benefit COVID-19 patients remains unclear. “Honestly, we don’t know why,” said Mainous. “There are a number of ideas out there. And obviously, our study doesn’t point to a specific mechanism.” One thought is that the flu vaccine essentially primes the body’s natural killer cells, which are part of the immune system. They can target tumors or virally infected cells, containing infections while the immune system’s other defenses are called into action to destroy a pathogenic invader. If the natural killer cell levels increase because of vaccination, they could presumably mount an attack on infections other than influenza, Yang said. Scientists “have shown in a couple of other studies that natural killer cell quantities in the lungs are decreased when you’re infected with COVID-19, especially if you have moderate to severe disease,” Yang said. So, he said, anything that enhances natural killer cell numbers could be beneficial to COVID-19 patients. Another theory is that components added to the flu vaccine to make it more effective — called adjuncts — heighten the body’s immune response generally. Previous research, Yang said, shows that vaccines with specific adjuncts might have offered protection to those infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, an earlier, less-deadly coronavirus infection first identified in 2003. Regardless of the mechanism, Mainous said, the patient data are clear. “The effect is there,” he said. “And it’s very, very strong.” Mainous and Yang said their research group also will continue to look at whether other types of vaccinations offer the same benefit, particularly the pneumococcal, or pneumonia vaccine, which typically is administered to older patients. Mainous said he hopes the study will spur people to get their flu vaccinations, especially with the influenza season quickly approaching. A majority of Americans, he said, don’t get their flu vaccinations. “One of the biggest problems we have with any preventive measure is getting people to do it,” Mainous said. “So, maybe this would be a pretty good push for people to go out and get their flu shot.” Media contact: Ken Garcia at kdgarcia@ufl.edu or 352-273-9799.

Right now is the right time to get your flu shot at your doctor's office, place of work, pharmacy or public health clinic. Photo by Getty Images Amid the autumn surge in COVID-19 cases throughout the U.S., infectious disease experts remain worried that a second and more worrisome scenario will eventually play out: an outbreak of seasonal influenza on top of the coronavirus pandemic. For that reason, they are urging all Americans to get their flu shots. Now. They are widely available, provided through some employers, colleges, at drug stores and doctorâs offices. Insurance through the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, Medicaid, and most private plans cover flu shots, and public health clinics typically provide them free or at low-cost. Ideally, a flu shot should be taken by the end of October. It takes two weeks for vaccine to build up enough antibodies against influenza, for a season that usually peaks from December through February. So far this year, because of mask-wearing, reduced travel and policies aimed at limiting indoor gatherings from schoolrooms to barrooms, there is very little influenza activity right now, in the U.S. or abroad. In fact, flu cases in the Southern Hemisphere, where winter occurs during our summer months, Â virtually disappeared as nations there responded to COVID-19. That is unusual. It is encouraging news. But the situation could change quickly. Despite low flu activity in the U.S., Â there have already been a small number of reported dual infections with both COVID-19 and influenza, including one confirmed last week in the San Francisco Bay Area. Fred Hutch infectious disease expert Dr. Steven Pergam Photo by Robert Hood / Fred Hutch News Service Doctors worry that the same pandemic fatigue that has led to behaviors that are rapidly spreading the coronavirus today could drive a surge of influenza should that virus pick up steam in the Northern hemisphere. We donât have a vaccine for COVID-19, but there is one for flu â nearly 200 million doses are available in the U.S. for this season. âWe think there is a good chance it is going to be a mild influenza season, but we canât be sure â so we need to prepare as we always do,â said Seattle flu researcher Dr. Steve Pergam, a professor at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and director of infection prevention at its clinical care partner Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. âPlanning is the key. It is very important to get a flu shot now, because we donât need an outbreak in addition to COVID-19,â he said. Since March, more than 225,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, and most of these tragedies play out in hospital intensive care units, which are being stretched to capacity in the latest surge. A sudden influx of influenza could be catastrophic. Only three years ago, an especially hard 2017-2018 flu season led to 810,000 hospitalizationsÂ and 61,000 deaths. Graphic courtesy of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Find out more about the flu The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health organizations provide a wealth of online information about influenza. Here are some important links: Key facts about flu vaccines from the CDC Flu Trends provides excellent interactive charts tracking flu cases. FLUView is the CDCâs detailed weekly analysis of influenza in the U.S. CDC estimates of influenza illness, hospitalization and deaths in recent flu seasons. The Immunization Action Coalition provides detailed, up-to-date expert answers to questions about flu. The nightmare that haunts doctors dealing with COVID-19 patients is that their intensive care units become overwhelmed. That is why many medical organizations, including Fred Hutch, are mandating flu shots this year for all employees. âIn bad flu season, it really puts a stress on the health care system,â Pergam said. âFor a front-line physician, the more respiratory illnesses that are coming in the door, the more personal protective equipment we have to use, the more testing we have to do, and the more beds and ICUs we use. A bad flu season can really shift that in a negative way.â As director of infection control for a cancer hospital, Pergam stresses that getting a flu shot, like wearing a mask, is an action that not only helps to protect you from disease, it can protect others from infection you might be carrying. Like COVID-19, influenza is particularly dangerous for the elderly. Cancer patients on chemotherapy, and especially those who are recovering from stem cell transplantation, are especially vulnerable to infectious diseases. A patient doesnât have to look ill to be at risk â by outward appearance they might look just as healthy as anyone else. Having a flu shot can protect friends, loved ones and strangers from getting influenza from you. sabin-russell Sabin Russell is a former staff writer at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center.

By City News Service • Published October 30, 2020 • Updated on November 1, 2020 at 2:33 pm AP Photo/Michel Euler The Riverside County Department of Animal Services today warned horse owners to beware of an equine influenza outbreak that has killed an estimated three dozen wild burros in the region. County and state officials are monitoring the outbreak while urging horse owners to check in with their veterinarians about booster vaccines for previously vaccinated animals. Horse owners are also being advised to ensure their animals are not exposed to sick burros by moving their animals away from fence lines in areas where the burros frequent. The first burro death occurred about two weeks ago and the death count is expected to rise, according to Animal Services officials. The highly contagious virus is specific to equids -- such as horses, mules and donkeys -- with severe symptoms more common in donkeys and mules, as well as in younger horses, ages one to five, said Animal Services spokesman John Welsh. Older horses typically exhibit milder symptoms, and the disease does not affect other species of animals, he said. Signs of the virus include fever, edema and enlarged lymph nodes. The disease -- one of the most common infectious diseases of the respiratory tract in horses -- spreads rapidly through groups of equids in aerosolized droplets dispersed by coughing or through fomite transmission -- meaning objects or surfaces which have become infected, officials said. Shared waterers, feeders and other equipment can transfer the disease from one animal to another. Emily Nietrzeba, an equine specialist veterinarian with the California Department of Food and Agriculture, said humans can not contract the disease, but people can carry the infection and transmit the virus between horses. County officials are reminding the public that feeding the wild burros is against the law and urged people to avoid all contact with the burros, especially anyone who owns horses.

Most of the wild burro deaths have occurred in the Reche Canyon area, but about six have occurred in the foothills along Pigeon Pass Road, Heacock Street and Redlands Boulevard, said Welsh. San Bernardino County officials said they have not had any reported cases. It is uncertain how many burros are in the hills between Riverside and San Bernardino counties, but some estimates put the number at approximately 500, Welsh said.

Col. Lisa Dennis, deputy commander of administration, Desmond T. Doss Health ClinicOctober 28, 2020 Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share on Reddit Share on LinkedIn Share via Email Beneficiaries can receive their flu shot at DDHC’s drive-thru flu drive at the Wheeler Gulch Multiple Deployment Facility (MDF) Warehouse. (Photo Credit: Jessica Meyer) VIEW ORIGINAL SCHOFIELD BARRACKS, Hawaii – This year’s influenza (flu) season will be significantly more challenging with the combination of COVID-19. Although Oahu is finally seeing a decrease in COVID-19 cases, there is a concern the flu season will complicate the treatment of ill patients who may have similar symptoms. Desmond T. Doss Health Clinic has been preparing since May for the flu season, specifically on making sure families understand the importance of getting their annual flu shot. “Traditionally, we like to set up a large family event where parents and kids can come to our clinic on a Saturday or during the week when school is out,” said Dr. Robert Neufeldt, chief of the DDHC Primary Care Clinic. “This gives us an opportunity to vaccinate a large number of people in our community at one time.” “Integrating measures that protect staff and patients from COVID exposure is paramount in supporting USARHAW [U.S. Army Hawaii] and the State of Hawaii’s efforts in stopping COVID,” Neufeldt added. According to the Centers for Disease Control, flu activity in the United States typically begins in the October to November timeframe and peaks between the months of December to February. The flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by the influenza virus, whereas COVID-19 is caused by infection with a new coronavirus known as SARS-CoV02. Many symptoms of the two are similar and will cause additional testing, since symptoms alone won’t be able to identify which illness a person might have. Symptoms of the flu include fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, muscle aches, headache and fatigue. The best way to prevent the flu is by getting vaccinated each year. The flu vaccine is recommended for everyone six months of age and older, including pregnant patients. Drive-thru Flu Shots Available at DDHC To ensure the maximum safety of beneficiaries and the DDHC staff during the ongoing pandemic, DDHC will be conducting flu vaccines in a drive-thru setting. “I have been a part of flu drives for over 10 years; this will be the first time I have ever initiated one as a drive-thru, where the majority of our patients remain in their vehicles to receive their vaccine,” said Jason Martin, population health nurse at the DDHC Primary Care Clinic. “It’s a unique challenge, but one we have trained for extensively, and we believe it will be well-received by the community.” The drive-thru setup is centered on safety, social distancing, and maximizing the number of patients vaccinated. Organizers said there will be adult and pediatric lanes in the drive-thru. Vehicles in which all passengers are age nine and older will be directed to the adult lane; vehicles will drive into a warehouse where staff will administer the vaccine while patients remain in their cars. “Having our flu-drive at this site will help our staff and community prepare and successfully execute any unexpected emergent mass vaccination event, so in the event we get a COVID-19 vaccine, how we are administering the flu shot this year would be very similar to how we would administer a COVID vaccine,” Neufeldt said. Vehicles with at least one child under nine will be directed to the pediatric lane. Once there, patients will get out of the vehicle and head to a social distancing area, where staff members will safely administer vaccines. Families will be able to receive the flu vaccine together in the pediatric lane. “Nine is the age we can safely administer a vaccine in their vehicle; however, there may be exceptions to this rule, which will be looked at on a case to case basis and we will be able to address those as families come through,” said Martin. “The flu drive will take place at the Wheeler Gulch Multiple Deployment Facility (MDF) Warehouse which is an excellent location for a drive-thru flu drive due to its large open space with zero chance of backing traffic up onto busy roads or past gates," said Lt. Col. Andy Torres, a nurse practitioner and chief nurse officer at the DDHC Primacy Care Clinic. Because of the pandemic, DDHC is planning for increased interest in this year’s flu-drive, organizers said. “We have had six months of advance planning, we have successfully completed our staff competency training and conducted several small ‘dry-runs’ in order to prepare for this event,” said Torres. The flu drive is scheduled for Nov. 18-20 from 9:30 a.m.-6 p.m., and Nov. 21 from 9 a.m.-4 p.m. at the Wheeler Gulch MDF Warehouse. Additional Information: Masks are required. Please wear a short sleeve shirt. Children under six years old should wear shorts. All non-active duty, TRICARE eligible beneficiaries including family members and retirees, regardless of branch of service or military treatment facility they are enrolled at, are welcome.

Since 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that influenza has resulted in between 140,000 and 810,000 hospitalizations each year and 12,000 to 61,000 deaths. There is always uncertainty surrounding how severe the influenza season will be from year-to-year. The severity of the season affects the amount of available healthcare resources, and this year is further complicated by COVID-19. The CDC highlights that, because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, reducing the spread of other viral respiratory illnesses like the flu this fall and winter is more important than ever. Getting the flu vaccine can decrease the number of deaths and complications from influenza, and decrease the complications due to COVID-19 infection. The flu vaccine does not protect against COVID-19, as these are different viruses. Symptoms of influenza and COVID-19 are similar. It is important to identify symptoms of possible influenza or COVID-19 early and contact your healthcare provider at the first sign of symptoms. Influenza may be treated with antiviral medication. The influenza season occurs primarily in the fall and winter, typically peaking between December and February; however, flu activity is seen as late as May. Getting vaccinated for the seasonal influenza is the best way to prevent influenza infection, and the CDC recommends everyone 6 months of age and older receive a flu vaccine every year. Although the flu vaccine will be available throughout the influenza season, to best protect yourself and your family, Cure SMA recommends getting your flu shot by the end of October or early November. Having SMA can result in more severe influenza infection and complications, due to underlying muscle weakness including respiratory muscle weakness and fatigue, or chronic lung issues related to aspiration. To reduce health complications, ensure individuals with SMA, their caregivers, and close contacts are up to date on their immunizations. General health maintenance is essential for everyone. In the context of COVID-19, all preventative measures matter. Individuals with SMA should ensure all their immunizations are current. Pneumococcal vaccines, including Prevnar 13 (PCV13) and Pneumovax (PPSV23), should be up to date, especially for older people with SMA. Pneumococcus is a common bacteria that causes infection in the respiratory system, including pneumonia and ear infections. After receiving the first tetanus, pertussis, and diphtheria vaccine, a tetanus booster vaccine should be obtained every 10 years. Additionally, Synagis (palivizumab) is a treatment used to help prevent serious lung disease caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in high-risk children under the age of 2 years during the viral season. Generally, a well-balanced diet will provide the vitamins and minerals your body needs to keep you healthy. Many people are vitamin D deficient especially during the winter months in colder climates. Please discuss whether you may benefit from a Vitamin D supplement with your healthcare provider. Some families and individuals may choose to supplement their diets with naturopathic options, like Vitamin C, echinacea, or elderberry. There is little published evidence of efficacy for these supplements. Be sure to communicate any supplements or medications you are taking with your healthcare team and be wary of anything that seems too good to be true. If you have any questions regarding this article or recommendation for flu/other vaccination, please reach out to us at [email protected]. COVID-19 Vaccine Precautions With the potential for a COVID-19 vaccine in the future, all individuals with SMA should take caution before volunteering for vaccine clinical trials. We encourage you to talk with your neurologist about trials and potential interactions with your current treatment protocols. This consideration is especially important for those considering gene replacement therapy, such as Zolgensma. Some COVID-19 vaccines are using Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV), and Zolgensma uses the AAV9 vector to deliver the SMA gene. Antibodies to AAV can interfere with the effectiveness of AAV-based gene replacement therapies. Additionally, steroids, like those used with Zolgensma treatment, may impact the timing of vaccinations. Vaccines may be delayed while on prednisone, depending on dose and duration. Any new vaccine that contains AAV should be discussed with your healthcare team. Do you like what you're reading? Help make a difference in the lives of people affected by spinal muscular atrophy.

Editor's note: This article was originally published by the HCPro Accreditation & Quality Compliance Center.As of January 1, 2021, you will have one less thing to worry about: The Joint Commission (TJC) is eliminating its requirement that hospitals set a goal toward achieving a 90% vaccination rate under Infection Prevention and Control standard IC.02.04.01.That standard requires hospitals to offer a flu vaccination to its licensed independent practitioners and staff.Under Element of Performance 5, hospitals were told to set “incremental influenza vaccination goals, consistent with achieving the 90% rate established in the national influenza initiatives for 2020.” Those initiatives, outlined in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Action Plan to Prevent Healthcare-Associated Infections, set the goal of a 90% vaccination rate among healthcare personnel. But in the August publication of the HHS “Healthy People 2030” goals, that 90% rate was removed, according to TJC’s announcement.Be aware that while the goal has been deleted, the rest of the standard remains in effect.And IC experts and emergency planners have encouraged hospitals to step up flu vaccinations along with the general public as the nation continues to battle the rising cases of COVID-19 from the 2019 coronavirus pandemic. Earlier this month, HHS extended through January 21 the national emergency declared in March because of the pandemic.“Organizations should continue to strive to increase compliance with influenza vaccinations and take action to improve vaccination rates,” according to TJC’s announcement. “Moving forward, The Joint Commission will not score noncompliance if the organization has not reach 90%, but instead will review that organizations have a goal to improve influenza vaccination rates and have leadership support and processes in place to support achievement of these goals.” A.J.

Video Ad Feedback Why Covid-19 spreads more in the winter 01:32 - Source: CNN CNN — In the deadly fall wave of the 1918 flu pandemic, millions of people were doomed because they didn’t know what we know now about how viruses and respiratory illnesses spread. We might face a similar fate if some people continue to ignore what a centuryof scientific progress and hindsight have taught us about ending pandemics. The 1918 pandemic transpired in three waves, from the spring of 1918 to the winter of 1919 — ultimately killing 50 million to 100 million people globally. The first wave in the spring of 1918 was relatively mild. A majority of 1918 flu deaths occurred in the fall of 1918 — the second, and worst, wave of the 1918 flu. The St. Louis Red Cross Motor Corps was on duty with mask-wearing women holding stretchers at the backs of ambulances during the influenza epidemic in Missouri in October 1918. Library of Congress Health experts expect Covid-19 infections to increase this winter because the virus that causes Covid-19 is a coronavirus, and other coronaviruses spread more during winter. In wintry, less-humid air, virus-carrying particles can linger in the air longer. Additionally, our nasal membranes are drier and more vulnerable to infection in winter. And as the weather gets colder, we spend more time indoors without sufficient ventilation, which means the virus has a higher likelihood of spreading. Covid-19 hasn’t “claimed as many lives yet as did influenza. Basically, around 675,000 people died in the US by the end of the 1918 pandemic,” said Dr. Jeremy Brown, an emergency care physician and author of “Influenza: The Hundred-Year Hunt to Cure the Deadliest Disease in History.” “That would, today, be around 3 million people in the US. The good news is that we haven’t seen those numbers — of course, the numbers are really quite appalling. “But, of course, the story that we’re talking about isn’t over yet,” Brown said. Why the second wave was so deadly There are several possibilities why the 1918 second wave was so horrible, including a virus that possibly mutated and patterns ofhuman movement and behavior at the time. Winter meant that influenza also spread more and people were indoors more often. “My guess is it wasn’t great at infecting people in the spring and had to sort of adapt,” said John M. Barry, author of “The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History.” “Then a mutation took over that was very good at infecting people and also more virulent.” In 1918 flu patients, pneumonia often quickly developed and killed people by the second day. Efforts for the First World War had taken over, so rampant spread was facilitated by troop movements and crowded military camps. Where military personnel traveled, so did the virus — resulting in influenza and pneumonia sickening 20% to 40% of the US Army and Navy personnel in the fall, interfering with induction, training and efficacy. “Influenza and pneumonia killed more American soldiers and sailors during the war than did enemy weapons,” a 2010 study reported. The 39th Regiment marched through the streets of Seattle in December 1918, while wearing masks made by the Seattle Chapter of the Red Cross. National Archives Six days after the first case of influenza was reported at Camp Devens, Massachusetts, cases multiplied to 6,674 cases. When Colonel Victor C. Vaughan remembered Camp Devens, “it was shocking,” wrote Gina Kolata, a science and medicine reporter at The New York Times, in her book “Flu: The Story of the Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918 and the Search for the Virus That Caused It.” “Here was Vaughan, in the midst of the first war to use modern weapons, a war that was felling young men with machine guns and gas warfare, and yet it was all nothing compared to this illness,” Kolata wrote. An immense obstacle wasalack of knowledge of the virus’ character, behavior and severity. The pandemic came before awareness of what a virus looked like and how to isolate and learn it. The vengeance of the second wave led some people and doctors to think they were dealing with a disease different than what had plagued them that spring. The announcing of the armistice on November 11, 1918, was the occasion for a grand celebration in Philadelphia. Thousands of attendees were infected with influenza. National Archives Flu deaths peaked in November 1918, which was possibly the deadliest month of the pandemic. A Philadelphia parade held on Armistice Day on November 11 gave thousands of attendees the flu. The social impact The 1918 flu ripped at the fabric of society. Roughly half of the deaths were among young adults ages 20 to 40, in contrast to the current pandemic, with older adults more likely to experience serious illness and death from Covid-19. Many events, schools and public spaces were canceled and closed. “‘The ghost of fear walked everywhere, causing many a family circle to reunite because of the different members having nothing else to do but stay home,’” wrote Kolata, quoting an Arizona newspaper. Female clerks in New York work with masks tied around their faces on October 16, 1918. National Archives Authorities imposed mask-wearing and anti-spitting laws. City officials inflicted punitive measures including fines against people who broke the rules. The Provost Marshal General of the US Army in October canceled a draft call of 142,000 men, despite Europe’s need for them. The toll on adults in their prime meant that many children lost one or both parents. The world lost generations of young people, and for them the pandemic and World War I became the central experiences of their lives. Modern-day advantage Now, let’s fast-forward to the year 2020. Multiple scientific advances have allowed us a slight advantage in mitigating the spread and effects of respiratory illnesses like the flu and Covid-19. Technological improvements have allowed researchers to view cells and viruses through electron microscopes and X-ray crystallography, which also enables capturing millions of images of them. Microbiologists can now isolate, identify and describe the structure of viruses. Although we have coronavirus tests, one shortcoming is “that we don’t have sufficient testing ability and the tests take so long,” Kolata said. “And when you start having something like the coronavirus where the symptoms can mimic those of the flu — high fever, chills — you can overwhelm the testing system really easily if the flu season really gets underway.” BURBANK, CALIFORNIA - AUGUST 24: Mend Urgent Care workers wearing personal protective equipment perform drive-up COVID-19 testing for students and faculty on the first day of school at Woodbury University on August 24, 2020 in Burbank, California. Most California schools are have gone virtual while others are placing physical distancing and other protocols like testing to keep in-person classes in session. (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images) Kevin Winter/Getty Images Related article Plenty of coronavirus tests are available, but they're not being used Thankfully, we’re not in a global war. Hindsight and years of scientific progress have taught us how respiratory illnesses spread by encounters with respiratory droplets facilitated by close contact and insufficient hygiene. However, to be effective, these scientific and medical advantages require public compliance. What we can do Though Covid-19 cases are increasing and could spike this winter, there are things we can do to stem the spread. Precautions such as physical distancing, avoiding gatherings and unnecessary travel, hand-washing and mask wearing are still important. Stocking up on grocery, medical and emergency preparedness items — responsibly and in a manner that’sconsiderate of others — can help limit trips to stores, thus decreasing chances of spread. In 1918, there wasn’t an approved and regulated vaccine. This time around with coronavirus, Operation Warp Speed and other programs are testing vaccines to be able to inoculate the public potentially by spring 2021.

This article is part of Infectious Disease Advisor’s In-Depth HIV coverage of the IDWeek 2020 meeting. The high-dose influenza vaccine (HDIV) demonstrated a 50% reduction in influenza-like illness (ILI) compared with the standard dose in HIV-infected patients, according to research presented atIDWeek, held virtually from October 21 to 25, 2020. In a retrospective cohort study, conducted at the University of Kansas Medical Center, included 219 patients with HIV during the 2017-2018 influenza season. The median age was 53 years and 197 patients (89.9%) were men. Within the cohort, 13.7% had a HIV viral load greater than 40 copies/mL and 5% had CD4 count less than 200 cells/µL. HDIV and standard dose influenza vaccines (SDIV) were administered to 119 patients (54.3%) and 77 patients (35.2%), respectively, and 23 patients (10.5%) were unvaccinated. A modified CDC definition of ILI, defined as fever and cough, sore throat, or shortness of breath occurred in 8 patients (10.4%) in the SDIV group compared with 6 patients (5.0%) in the HDIV group (P =.16). A broader protocol-defined ILI, defined as sore throat, cough, or shortness of breath with either fever, chills, headache, or myalgia was reported in 16 patients (20.8%) and 12 patients (10.1%) of the SDIV and HDIV groups, respectively (P =.04). There was no difference in confirmed influenza cases between groups. Vaccine side effects were mild, occurring in 11 patients (14.3%) in the SDIV group compared with 13 patients (10.9%) in the HDIV group (P =.5). Vaccine dose (SDIV odds ratio [OR], 2.34; 95% CI, 1.04-5.37; P =.04) and age in years (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.94-1.0; P =.045) were associated with protocol-defined ILI. HDIV remained protective regardless of age. The CDC reported an influenza attack rate of 14.7% in US adults and an overall vaccine effectiveness of 38% for the 2017-2018 influenza season. This study “demonstrated a 50% relative reduction in protocol-defined ILI with the HDIV compared [with] standard-dose vaccine our HIV clinic in 2017-2018,” study authors concluded. Investigators, therefore, recommended a larger prospective randomized control trial on the effectiveness of the HDIV in HIV patients.

Skip the Advil, Aleve, for Mild Discomfort It’s best to avoid common pain relievers after a flu shot because they can dilute the power of the vaccine, according to research conducted at the University of Rochester Medical Center. Ibuprofen (Advil), aspirin and naproxen (Aleve) dampen the production of necessary antibodies that protect the body against illness, scientists said. Many over-the-counter pain and fever-reducers are classified as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), which act in part by blocking the cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2) enzyme. But blocking the cox-2 enzyme is not a good idea in the context of vaccination, because the cox-2 enzyme is necessary for high production of B-lymphocytes. When people take medications like Advil for discomfort at the injection site they’re also inadvertently reducing the ability of B cells to make the antibodies that protect against the flu. “Unless your health care provider tells you otherwise, it’s best not to take pain relievers one or two days before the flu vaccine and for a week afterward,” said David J. Topham, Ph.D., a study author and professor in the Center for Vaccine Biology and Immunology at URMC. What about low-dose aspirin? Individuals who take aspirin for cardiovascular or vascular disease should talk to their doctors before stopping even low-dose aspirin. And people who take medications such as Celebrex for arthritis or other chronic pain also should consult their physicians. Scientist Richard Phipps, Ph.D., who led the research, gained national attention in 2009 when he presented the flu data at a scientific meeting, and then published two scientific articles in the journals Vaccine and Immunology.

This level of outreach is intended to alleviate any anxieties Veterans have about additional impacts the flu has in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. Dr. Jose Cadena-Zuluaga, chief of Infectious Diseases (left), and Shay Keen, associate chief of Pharmacy, explain which vaccines are available. Pandemic or not, Dr. Jose Cadena-Zuluaga, chief of Infectious Diseases at STVHCS, says the flu vaccine has two purposes. “It’s important to get the vaccine because it can prevent the disease. If they get sick, it can also make it milder and protect them from complications and hospital admissions.” The latter benefit is critical during this time because throughout many metropolitan areas, bed space is an important component in handling any surge of COVID or influenza cases. Like clockwork Army Veteran Luis Ramirez, who transferred his care from Puerto Rico to San Antonio four years ago, said he gets his vaccinations like clockwork. “Since I was in the Army for 20 years, I was just used to getting them. It was just easy to do when I started getting seen at VA.” Throughout the presentation, the audience was presented poll questions. The first queried the VA services available. When asked if Veterans were aware that VA provides all qualifying Veterans the flu vaccine, 80% polled responded yes. Marine Corps Veteran Candor Tovar takes advantage of the South Texas VA’s drive thru flu clinic, which opened after the tele townhall. Another polling question asked Veterans if they knew the South Texas VA offered the flu vaccine at eight drive-thru locations across the city. One Veteran who already knew about the drive-thru clinics was Marine Corps Veteran Candor Tovar, who drove up with his daughter. He has been with STVHCS since it opened in 1974. He gets his flu shot because he took his doctor’s advice: “I get my shot every year because my doctor recommends it. Even if I still contract the flu, it will be much less severe.” Multiple functions Tovar went through the line quickly. The drive-thru clinics opened for this season were meant to make the process convenient for patients. Only 10% of Veterans realized this service was offered. Another function of the town hall was to increase the public’s knowledge of influenza. Cadena-Zuluaga asked the participants, “Does the flu vaccine increase the risk of contracting COVID?” He answered: “There is no evidence of this. The flu vaccine will not increase the chances of contracting COVID.” Cadena-Zuluaga closed out the session by reiterating the importance of the high-risk group getting vaccinated. That group includes young children, patients with a high body mass index, nursing home residents, immunocompromised, diabetics and the elderly. This high-risk group makes up a majority of South Texas patients. For this reason, STVHCS continues to offer vaccinations across the city at all its clinics.

Our study aimed to explore the spatial and temporal characteristics of wild migratory waterfowl’s wintering habitat in the Republic of Korea (ROK) and to evaluate the impact of these habitats on the risk of HPAI outbreaks in commercial poultry farms. The habitat use of 344 wild migratory waterfowl over four migration cycles was estimated based on tracking records. The association of habitat use with HPAI H5N8 outbreaks in poultry farms was evaluated using a multilevel logistic regression model. We found that a poultry farm within a wild waterfowl habitat had a 3–8 times higher risk of HPAI outbreak than poultry farms located outside of the habitat. The range of wild waterfowl habitats increased during autumn migration, and was associated with the epidemic peak of HPAI outbreaks on domestic poultry farms in the ROK. Our findings provide a better understanding of the dynamics of HPAI infection in the wildlife–domestic poultry interface and may help to establish early detection, and cost-effective preventive measures.

It is adapted to a broad range of host species from wild birds to humans1,2. HPAI infection has been a high-priority concern in the global poultry industry because of the massive financial losses associated with HPAI outbreaks3,4,5. Migratory waterfowl of the genus Anas, or “dabbling ducks”, are considered one of the most important reservoirs and long-distance carriers in the global spread of HPAI1. This information is supported by experimental evidence of asymptomatic avian influenza virus (AIV) infection and viral shedding in waterfowl6,7,8,9,10,11,12, the genetic relatedness of AIV strains between poultry and wild birds13,14,15, and the spatial and temporal proximity of HPAI infection in domestic poultry16,17,18. The poultry industry in the Republic of Korea (ROK) (i.e., South Korea) has suffered each year due to the introduction of novel HPAI strains since the early 2000s19,20. In every HPAI outbreak, migration of wild waterfowl from other countries has been suspected as a major source of novel AIV introduction to domestic poultry farms6,20. The global outbreak of HPAI H5N8 in 2014 was an unprecedented event that demonstrated the impact of long-distance migration of wild waterfowl on the global spread of this novel HPAI strain21. In January 2014, two novel strains of HPAI H5N8 virus were identified in wild waterfowl in the ROK; one of the strains led to HPAI outbreaks in domestic poultry farms in 2014 and 201513,17,22. This HPAI H5N8 strain was subsequently identified in Japan, Europe and North America23,24,25,26,27, and was comprised of five gene segments (HA, PB2, PA, M, and NS) from the novel HPAI H5N2 virus in 2014 that caused unprecedented HPAI outbreaks in the US4,14,28. The global consortium for H5N8 and related influenza viruses reported phylogenetic, biological and ecological evidence supporting the role of migratory waterfowl as a factor in the long-distance spread of HPAI H5N8 virus6,29,30. However, understanding the epidemiological impact of spatial and temporal overlap between domestic poultry farms and wild waterfowl habitats on HPAI outbreaks is still limited. Investigating the introduction of a novel pathogen and its spillover from wildlife to domestic animals has been challenging using conventional epidemiological approaches because of the difficulty in gauging exposure dynamics at the wildlife-domestic interface31.Recent improvements in tracking technology have enabled high-resolution measurement of wildlife habitat use by large and small animals both on land and in the air32,33. Traditionally, the identification of wildlife habitat has been limited to a few observations in multiple fixed locations34,35. However, this approach has difficulty capturing the spatial and temporal dynamics of wildlife behavior relevant to studying the wildlife-domestic interface. Current light-weight tracking devices using solar-powered batteries can track a small flying animal over several months, recording a high-quality trajectory with limited impact on natural behavior32,33. Concurrent with the technological advancement of tracking devices, novel statistical approaches in combination with high computational power allow us to precisely estimate wildlife habitats from collected trajectories36,37. The dynamic Brownian bridge movement model (dBBMM) presented by Kranstuaber et al.38 provides a valuable statistical framework to estimate utilization distribution (UD), a probability density illustrating the relative frequency of an animal's habitat use during the period of observation, derived from a trajectory of the wild animal’s dynamic movement pattern by selecting the best-fit combination of multiple motion variances. Both technical and theoretical advances in trajectory-based habitat estimation give us an opportunity to better explore the complex eco-epidemiology of wildlife9,39,40,41,42,43.Our study focused on defining the spatial and temporal characteristics of the habitats of three representative wild migratory waterfowl species wintering in the ROK. Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of these wild waterfowl’s habitats on the risk of HPAI outbreaks in commercial poultry farm locations. Our results aim to provide a better understanding of the dynamics of wild migratory waterfowl’s habitats at fine spatio-temporal scales, and how these dynamics affects the risk of introduction or transmission of novel pathogens from wildlife to domestic animals. Ultimately, our study presents a novel epidemiological approach combining trajectory-based habitat estimation for monitoring influenza virus at the wildlife-domestic interface and provide a baseline for HPAI risk-based surveillance in commercial poultry farms in the ROK.ResultsOur study estimated the habitat use of 344 wild migratory waterfowl for three major species (Common Teals, Mallards and Spot-billed Ducks) wintering in the ROK from 2013 to 2016 (Table 1). Most migratory waterfowl returned from Northeast China or the far east regions of Russia to western and mid-central provinces of the ROK (JN: Jeollanam-do, JB: Jeollabuk-do, CN: Chungcheongnam-do and CB: Chungcheongbuk-do) for autumn migration between September and November (Fig. 1a,e,i). During the wintering period, from December to January, all three species showed short-range movements within a limited area for feeding or resting; Spot-billed Ducks and Mallards changed their habitats once or twice to southern regions in the western provinces of the ROK (Fig. 1b,f,j). Wild migratory waterfowl expanded their habitat use during the spring migration from February to March. All Common Teals migrated to Northeast China, Primorsky or Khabarovsk regions of Russia (Fig. 1c). 41.1% of the Mallards (39/95) migrated to northeast China, Mongolia, and Russia (Fig. 1g). 2.4% of Spot-billed Duck (1/41) migrated at the end of March; the remaining 97.6% of Spot-billed Ducks (40/41) did not migrate and remained in the ROK (Fig. 1k). During the breeding period from April to August, we observed a secondary migration of Common Teals to the North Chukotka region of Russia (Fig. 1d). 80.5% of Mallards (33/41) migrated to Northern China, Mongolia, or Russia but the remaining 19.5% (8/41) stayed in the ROK (Fig. 1h). 88.5% of Spot-billed Ducks (23/26) did not migrate until April; 11.5% of three birds (3/26) migrated to Northeast China during breeding period (Fig. 1l).Table 1 Summary of wild migratory birds marked and tracked in our study.

All UDs were estimated and plotted using R version 3.6.1 and ArcMap version 10.7.Full size imageA total of 386 HPAI H5N8 outbreaks occurred between Jan. 2014 and Nov. 2015. These were classified by three epidemic waves; 209 HPAI outbreaks in the 1st wave (Jan. 2014 to Aug. 2014), 154 HPAI outbreaks in the 2nd wave (Sep. 2014 to Jun. 2015), and 23 HPAI outbreaks in the 3rd wave (Sep. 2015 to Nov. 2015) (Fig. 2a). The HPAI H5N8 outbreaks occurred on 350 poultry farms; a total of 26 poultry farms were infected more than twice during the three H5N8 epidemics periods. During the three epidemics, duck farms showed a five times higher incidence of H5N8 outbreaks than chicken farms (Fig. 2a). During the autumn migration period, HPAI H5N8 outbreaks only occurred at duck farms in two southwestern provinces (JN and JB) (Fig. 2b). HPAI H5N8 outbreaks were identified in both duck and chicken farms, across all of the western provinces (JN, JB, CN, CB & GG: Gyeonggi-do), and in one southeastern province (GN: Gyeongsangnam-do), during the wintering period (Fig. 2c). The western provinces (JN, JB, CN, CB and GG) showed the highest incidence of infection during the spring migration period compared to the other seasonal periods (Fig. 2d). HPAI H5N8 incidence decreased in these provinces during the breeding period from April to August (Fig. 2e).Figure 2Summary of HPAI H5N8 outbreaks in the Republic of Korea from 2014 to 2016. (a) The number of HPAI outbreaks per month in 5 types of commercial poultry farms by the annual cycle of migration of wild migratory waterfowl [Period 1(P1): The autumn migration from September to November, Period 2 (P2): wintering from December to January, Period 3 (P3): the spring migration from February to March and Period 4 (P4): breeding from April to August]. Maps of centroids of HPAI case and non-case farms and incidence of HPAI in each province in (b) Period 1, (c) Period 2, (d) Period 3 and (e) Period 4. All Maps were made using ArcMap version 10.7.Full size imageThe habitat predictor selection among three UDs using cumulative probabilities (75, 95 and 99%) determined that the best-fit predictors occurred in the 95% UDs for all three species, except in the best-fit predictor of Common Teals in the period concurrent with an HPAI outbreak (75% UD) (Supplementary Table S1). We found that a commercial poultry farm located within a wild migratory waterfowl habitat during an epidemic had 3–8 times higher odds of HPAI outbreak than poultry farms outside of waterfowl habitat (Table 2). Conversely, poultry farms within the habitats of Mallards and Common Teals during the period prior to an HPAI outbreak had 3–4 times lower odds than the farms outside of the habitat (Table 2). Commercial poultry farm type was a risk factor for an HPAI outbreak in all six regression models (Table 2). Duck farms had a significantly higher odds for an HPAI outbreak than chicken farms; breeding duck farms showed the highest odds for an HPAI outbreak among the five types of poultry farms. The flock size of the farm was not a significant predictor in the regression models and was excluded in the final model selection. Our final model included farm type, and geographical location of commercial poultry farms: inside or outside of Common Teals’ and Mallards’ habitats in both the concurrent period, and the period prior to an HPAI outbreak, and Spot-billed Ducks’ habitat in the period concurrent with an HPAI outbreak, as five significant predictors (Table 3). Poultry farms within the habitat of all three wild migratory waterfowl in the period concurrent with an HPAI outbreak, showed a positive association with the risk of HPAI outbreak on the poultry farms. On the other hand, poultry farms within the habitat of Mallards and Common Teals in the period prior to an HPAI outbreak were negatively associated with the risk of HPAI outbreak. The final model’s ability to predict HPAI outbreaks was high, with an AUC of 0.86 for the ROC curve, and used to generate the HPAI risk map. The predictive HPAI risk map revealed that western and mid-central provinces of ROK had the highest risk for HPAI outbreaks, and that the risk was mostly concentrated during the spring migration period (Fig. 3).Table 2 Results of the multilevel logistic regression model including one variable of wild waterfowl species habitat.Full size tableTable 3 Results of the final multilevel logistic regression model including all variables of wild waterfowl species habitat.Full size tableFigure 3Risk maps and uncertainty maps of HPAI outbreaks in commercial poultry farms predicted by the final model with Kernel density considering migratory waterfowl habitat uses and demographic factors of poultry farms.

The risk and residuals of HPAI were estimated and plotted using R version 3.6.1 and ArcMap version 10.7.Full size imageDiscussionOur study investigated the spatial characteristics of the annual migration cycles of three wild migratory waterfowl species abundant in the ROK, and their association with the outbreaks of novel HPAI virus on domestic poultry farms, using satellite telemetry data from over 300 birds and national HPAI epidemic data. Our results revealed that commercial poultry farms located within the habitats of Common Teals, Mallards and Spot-billed Ducks, especially within the regions used for resting and feeding via short and mid-range flights (95% UD), showed significantly higher risk for HPAI outbreaks compared to poultry farms outside of the habitat. Consistent with previous studies6,7,8,9,11,12,14,17,19,20,21,29,44, our results showed that the core movement of wild migratory waterfowl likely plays an important role in the spillover of HPAI virus between wild birds and domestic poultry farms. Specifically, we found that the expansion of the habitat range of both migratory and non-migratory sub-populations of wild migratory waterfowl during the spring migration coincided with the highest risk of disease outbreak during the HPAI H5N8 epidemics from 2014 to 2015. During spring migration, non-migratory sub-populations of wild waterfowl showed physiological migratory restlessness, called Zugunruhe45. Although our study did not address the pathway of HPAI virus spillover between wild birds and domestic poultry farms, the increase in short-range movements of non-migratory sub-populations during the spring migration season may result in extensive spillover of HPAI virus between wild birds and domestic poultry farms through direct introduction and/or accidental infection by wild animals residing in proximity to poultry farms46,47.Our findings suggest that commercial duck farms could play a pivotal role in linking the introduction of novel HPAI strains from wild waterfowl and the spread of HPAI outbreaks between poultry farms.In January 2014, two novel HPAI H5N8 strains were detected in wild waterfowl in a major wintering site of wild migratory waterfowl; one of the novel HPAI strains was subsequently identified in a commercial duck farm close to the detection site17. The initial HPAI epidemic wave started at commercial duck farms during the autumn migration period. Duck farms had approximately three times higher risk of HPAI outbreaks than chicken farms during the HPAI epidemics period. Duck farms in ROK have been more susceptible to spillover of novel HPAI strains from wild birds than chicken farms due to the lack of enhanced biosecurity facilities and practices, and the higher density of duck farms around major wintering sites of wild migratory birds compared to chicken farms40,48,49,50,51,52. Furthermore, the HPAI H5N8 strain in the ROK is considered to be more host-adapted to the order Anseriformes based on its lower mortality among, and higher transmissibility and affinity for, ducks compared to other HPAI strains30. Mild clinical signs in ducks could also have led to late detection of HPAI H5N8 infection, potentially allowing “silent” inter-farm transmission to chicken farms as well as additional duck farms. Even though the role of wild migratory waterfowl as carriers of HPAI virus in the transmission chain among poultry farms is still controversial12,41,53, our study supports this. Given the epidemiological conditions of the ROK’s poultry industry (Abundance of duck farms), the link between commercial duck farms and wild waterfowl could contribute to amplifying the spillover of novel HPAI strains through the wildlife-domestic interfaces leading to increase inter-farm transmission48,50,54. Therefore, risk-based surveillance conducted for both wild waterfowl and duck farms, especially during the autumn migration period, may enable rapid detection of novel HPAI viruses and the initiation of cost-effective preventive measures for HPAI outbreaks in domestic poultry.Long-distance spring migrations of three wild waterfowl species to breeding grounds in high-latitude regions may play an important role in the international transmission of HPAI virus. The annual census of wild birds in the ROK estimates that more than 300,000 Mallards are annually observed in South Korea. Our tracking records indicated that around 240,000 Mallards (80%) are expected to migrate to breeding sites in Northeast China and Mongolia—the corridor of the East Asia and Australian flyway, and the Central Asian flyways toward the Arctic coast of the Eurasian continent. Although only 11% of marked Spot-billed Ducks migrated to Northeast China, we expect Spot-billed Ducks to have a large number of migratory sub-populations as one of the most abundant wild migratory waterfowl wintering in the ROK (Approximately 1.8 million birds). The spring migration of Mallards and Spot-billed Ducks could potentially contribute to the spread of HPAI strains across the Eurasian continent, considering the significant association between the spatial and temporal overlap of wild migratory waterfowl and poultry farms with HPAI outbreaks, abundance of species, detection of HPAI antigen and antibodies17, and the short duration of spring migration (1–2 days) compared to asymptomatic infection duration (3–5 days)41. The population of Common Teals is estimated at approximately 30,000 birds in the ROK. All tracked Common Teals migrated to the Bering strait along the East Asia and Australian flyway. The convergence of East Asia and Australian, and Pacific American flyways suggests the exchange of HPAI strains during the post-breeding staging of Common Teals could play an important role in the intercontinental transmission between North America and East Asia21. However, the short asymptomatic HPAI infection duration (< 3 days) of the Common teal in comparison to their stopover period (3–5 weeks) makes it unlikely that the Common Teal is a major HPAI carrier throughout their two-stage migration from the ROK to the North Chukotka region of Russia55. Investigation of HPAI infection and recombination in the key stopover sites in the Primorsky and Khabarovsk regions of Russia may explain how migration of the Common Teals influences the transmission of AIV between North America and East Asia.Despite recovering more than 400 satellite tracks of wild migratory waterfowl, with a high tracking success rate (≈ 70%), our study highlights the technical limitations to using tracking devices. According to the annual census of wild birds, more than 250,000 waterfowl belonging to 400 species migrate to winter in ROK. Even though we tracked a much larger number of wild waterfowl compared to previous studies39,41,43,56, and observed fine-scale habitat use of the most common and abundant species, our observations are still limited in terms of characterizing the movements of the full diversity of wild waterfowl species that overwinter in the ROK31 (400 trajectories ≈ 0.18% of the population). Furthermore, due to the lack of firmly-established evidence defining the HPAI spillover interval between wild birds and domestic poultry, we aggregated the UD of a species not by a regular interval between the habitat use of wild birds and HPAI outbreak in a poultry farm, but by the four periods of the annual migration cycle. Trajectories recorded by different devices posed an additional challenge in aggregating habitat use from individual to species level. The number of tracking points and positional error of the device are key parameters to improve the precision of dBBMM estimation by decreasing the variance of a UD. Across the period of wild bird tracking from 2013 to 2016, our CTT transmitters improved in regard to duration of observation, positional error, and the number of tracking points (from 1 to 12 locations per day) (Table 1). Every year, device advancements improved the precision of individual level UD. However, the aggregation of multiple individual level UDs into a species level UD resulted in a loss of overall precision due to the averaging of variances. Consequently, the aggregation might overestimate the relationship between the wild migratory birds’ habitat use and an HPAI outbreaks by including potential “false positive” case farms that overlapped with the aggregate UD, but were actually spatially and temporally mismatched. In the future, we will attempt to address these limitations by collecting additional tracking records from global data-sharing platforms that provide an accessible web-based database (e.g. Movebank)57,58. Furthermore, we will apply of advanced methods to harmonize the aggregation of UDs with inconsistent variance (e.g. weighted linear methods59) and/or estimate the suitability of habitat use based on fine-scale environmental factors (e.g. species distribution model)60,61,62.We acknowledge that the horizontal transmission of HPAI through poultry trade networks between poultry farms was likely a significant factor in its spread, and these events were not fully captured in our study52. While the multiple-site production system of the modern livestock industry has significantly improved the efficiency of production, livestock movement between farms is considered an important route of disease transmission63,64,65,66,67,68,69. Even though the farm type (X2), and the flock size of the poultry farm (X3) could partially capture the frequency and intensity of poultry shipments, those factors were likely not enough to allow the quantification of the full impact of poultry trade on HPAI outbreaks. In the future, if shipment records between poultry farms and/or the genetic information of the HPAI virus isolated from both wild birds and poultry farms become available, we will explore the impact of inter-farm transmission of HPAI among commercial poultry farms, and evaluate how poultry trade contributes to HPAI outbreaks compared to the role of wild birds53.We provided fine-scale risk maps capturing the intersection of habitat use between wild migratory waterfowl and domestic poultry in different periods, and measured the strength of association between the wildlife-domestic interface and HPAI outbreaks. This approach assists us to have a better epidemiological understanding of the dynamics of the wild-domestic interface in Northeast Asia and its impact on disease spread to commercial livestock farms. Prediction tools for HPAI outbreaks not only inform policy makers in the establishment of cost-effective early detection and preventive measures for novel HPAI strains in the ROK, but also support international initiatives to prevent and control HPAI epidemics globally. The future of global infectious disease surveillance, including HPAI, should follow a One Health framework as many emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic, affecting wildlife, livestock, and humans31,70,71,72,73. The use of eco-epidemiological approaches, such as the one presented in this study, may assist to evaluate how short, medium, and long-term changes in environmental, climatic, and land-use factors may affect the dynamics of the ecosystem and contribute to disease spread42,74,75,76.MethodsTrajectories of wild migratory waterfowlOur study collected trajectories of wild migratory waterfowl from the division of veterinary epidemiology in the Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency (APQA) in ROK. A total of 641 wild birds from 15 species were captured and marked from March 2013 to March 2016 in major wintering habitats of migratory waterfowl in the ROK (Supplementary Fig. S1). The trajectories of captured birds were recorded by either Platform Terminal transmitter (PTT-100) using satellite telemetry or Cellular Tracking Technology (CTT), which transmits the signal of a geographical location, with a range error of less than 50 m every 6 h using cellular networks. The CTT transmitter weighed less than 2% of the body weight of the birds. Marked birds were released near their capture location (Table 1). All procedures for marking, capture and handling are reviewed annually and were approved by the research authority of APQA in the ROK.Habitat estimation of wild migratory waterfowlOur study selected a subset of wild migratory waterfowl the trajectories (n = 344) for three species (Common Teals, Mallards and Spot-billed Ducks) from the original 15 species based on three criteria: (1) large population size based on the annual census of wild birds reported by the Ministry of Environment in the ROK, (2) HPAI H5N8 virus or antibody identification during annual wild bird surveillance17,77,78 and (3) experimental evidence of asymptomatic HPAI infection55,79. Wild migratory waterfowl wintering in the ROK follow an annual cycle of migration at distinct times. To identify the habitat use of three species during the phases of migration, and how this characteristic influences the risk of HPAI outbreak at commercial poultry farms, trajectories were separated into seasons of the annual cycle as defined by the National Institute of Biological Resources in the ROK16: Period 1: Autumn migration (September to November); Period 2: Wintering (December to January); Period 3: Spring migration (February to March), and Period 4: Breeding (April to August). Trajectories with less than two locations per a day and shorter than two weeks were excluded (n = 49). Finally, a total of 492 trajectories for 344 birds across four periods were used to estimate the UD, a probability density representing the relative frequency of an animal's occupation in the region during the period of the trajectory observation36. For example, 50% of the UD depicts the region where a bird spent 50% of the observation period considering motion variance and positional error. The UD of a trajectory was estimated by dBBMM38 using the “Move” package80 in R studio (Version 3.6.1)81,82. Each UD of a trajectory was summarized by three isopleth maps with cumulative probability contours of 75%, 95% and 99%, which represent the spatial distribution where the bird spent 75%, 95% and 99% of their time during the observation period. Following previous behavioral studies of migratory birds39,43, we assumed that the isopleth maps within 75% of the UD were used for resting and core movement during short flights, those between 75 and 95% UD were used for feeding and scouting during mid-range flights, and those between 95 and 99% UD were used for long-distance flights with temporary stops. A bird-level isopleth map was merged with a species-level isopleth map using three cumulative probabilities in four periods with ArcGIS (V 10.7, ESRI, US). Finally, a total of 36 isopleth maps (three species x three probabilities x four periods) were made to identify the most likely habitat use for each of the three species of wild migratory waterfowl for each period.Estimation of risk of HPAI outbreaks on poultry farms by overlapping with wild waterfowl habitatsWe conducted a cross-sectional study involving HPAI positive case farms and counter-matching samples from nested cohort non-case farms to evaluate the risk of HPAI outbreaks on poultry farms by overlapping with wild waterfowl habitats. During the HPAI H5N8 outbreak period from January 2014 to November 2015, national surveillance was conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, ROK. Every commercial poultry farm registered in the Korean Animal Health Information System (KAHIS) was diagnosed at least once by both HPAI H5N8 antigen and antibody tests. All diagnostic tests were conducted by the animal disease diagnostic laboratory of APQA in the ROK. A “case farm” was defined as a commercial chicken or duck farm with positive test results for either antigen or antibody of HPAI H5N8 virus. A total of 350 commercial poultry farms in 386 HPAI H5N8 outbreaks were included in this study. A “non-case farm” was defined as a commercial chicken or duck farm where neither antigen nor antibodies of HPAI H5N8 were detected through the national surveillance. A total of 772 non-case farms were randomly selected from 37,867 non-case nested cohort farms with 80 (5 × 16) strata to ensure equivalent representation of the five commercial poultry farm types (chicken layers, broilers, chicken breeders, fattening duck, and breeding duck farms) within each of the 16 provinces reported in the poultry industry census published by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, ROK in 2016. The ratio between case and non-case farms (case = 350, non-case = 772; total n = 1,122) equated to a 1:2 ratio to account for the cost of data collection and validation, and to ensure a statistical power higher than 80% (99.999% × 0.91 = 91%). The data were comprised of farm ID, species, production type, flock size, latitude and longitude of the farms’ centroid, radius of the farm, and date of HPAI identification. The data were obtained from KAHIS after data de-identification to preserve the confidentiality of farm owners’ personal information.A multilevel logistic regression model with random intercepts was used to measure the statistical association between the location of commercial poultry farms inside or outside of estimated habitats of migratory waterfowl, and HPAI outbreaks. Equation (1) was used to estimate the risk of HPAI outbreak on a poultry farm during each period.$$ \begin{aligned} & y_{ijk} \sim Binomial \left( {n_{ijk} ,\pi_{ijk} } \right) \\ & logit \left( {\pi_{ijk} } \right) = \beta_{o} + \beta_{1} X_{1ijk} + \beta_{2} X_{2ijk} + \beta_{3} X_{3ijk} + \beta_{4} X_{4ijk} + \beta_{5} X_{5ijk} \\ & \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad + \beta_{6} X_{6ijk} + \beta_{7} X_{7ijk} + \beta_{8} X_{8ijk} + \beta_{9} X_{9ijk} + \mu_{j} + \mu_{k} \\ \end{aligned} $$ (1) \({y}_{ijk}\): The HPAI outbreak in a poultry farm i located in province j at period k (0 = No /1 = Yes).

To assess a potential lag from the habitat use of wild waterfowl to HPAI outbreaks in poultry farms, the model included additional three binary predictors of whether a poultry farm i was located inside or outside of three species’ isopleths (X2, X4, and X6) at the migration period k − 1 prior to an HPAI outbreak (0 = Out /1 = In). Our study selected one predictor among 75%, 95%, and 99% of cumulative probability isopleths for the location of the poultry farm in each of three species’ habitat (X1 to X6). Goodness of fits of candidate regression models including each UD isopleth predictor were compared using Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve (Table S1). One of five poultry farm types (X7), the radius of a poultry farm (X8), the flock size of a poultry farm (X9) and their interactions were included as covariates in the model. Our model included two random effects, one for the production site ID of a poultry farm (μk) to account for the repeated measures design (i.e., four observations of HPAI within each farm, one for each period of the annual cycle of migration), and another for the province of a farm (μi) to account for spatial clustering of farms within the same province. The final model was built using backward variable selection and a final model was selected based on the lowest AIC. The final model was used to create risk prediction maps for an HPAI outbreaks in the ROK across four periods, by simple spatial smoothing methods (i.e. Kernel density). We also created uncertainty maps to present the variation of predicted probability within the risk maps. The predicted probability and Pearson residual of an HPAI outbreak around a poultry farm were estimated using Kernel density with the weight of 6 km bandwidth in ArcGIS (V 10.7, ESRI, US). All statistical analyses were performed in R studio (V 1.1.463)81,82. All methods were conducted in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations of the research authority of APQA in the ROK. ReferencesWebster, R. G., Bean, W. J., Gorman, O. T., Chambers, T.

But are his claims correct? Claim: Flu deaths are currently higherSir Rocco Forte said "at the moment now, we have more people dying of influenza and pneumonia than we have of Covid".According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), between January and August there were 48,168 deaths due to the coronavirus, compared with 13,619 due to pneumonia and 394 due to influenza.In England, there are currently 10,308 people being treated in hospital for Covid-19, whereas last week there were only two people admitted to hospital with influenza.According to William Irving, a professor of virology at the University of Nottingham, "we've seen very few influenza cases thus far"."We get winter epidemics of influenza every year, the timing does vary - could happen anytime from October through to February - but we've definitely not started one yet this winter."Covid deaths three times higher than flu and pneumoniaCovid: How worried should we be?Claim: Covid-19 excess deaths are the same as 2017-18 winter flu seasonSir Rocco compared excess deaths from Covid-19 and winter flu three years ago, saying in the "2017-18 flu epidemic, there were 50,000 excess deaths... you've had the same number of excess deaths during this pandemic".He is confusing excess deaths (the number of deaths in a particular period compared with the average number for that period over the past five years) with winter excess deaths (the number of deaths in the whole of the winter compared with the number in summer).Over the winter of 2017-18 there were about 50,000 winter excess deaths in England and Wales, but only about half that number of excess deaths - that's because you expect more people to die in the winter than the summer for various reasons, one of which is flu.Sir Rocco's comparison also doesn't account for the public health measures in place during the coronavirus pandemic."Restrictions put in place in March prevented hundreds of thousands of additional deaths, by contrast with flu where restrictions were not put in place," said Dr Deepti Gurdasani, an epidemiologist at Queen Mary University of London."This is because SARS-CoV-2 spreads more rapidly than the flu, and is several fold deadlier when it causes infection."Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, there have been 66,599 excess deaths in the UK.Claim: Epidemiologists forecast 500,000 Covid-19 deaths in UKSir Rocco accused the government of panicking "on the basis of a forecast of 500,000 deaths". He went on to say "we're now seeing [a] new forecast done by the same people who made the mistakes last time round forecasting Armageddon".Back in March a report by Prof Neil Ferguson, who worked as a government adviser in the early stages of the pandemic, predicted that 500,000 could die if the government did not take action.The modelling predicted very high numbers of deaths for both the UK and the US, but only "in the (unlikely) absence of any control measures or spontaneous changes in individual behaviour".Shortly after the UK went into lockdown Prof Ferguson said he was "reasonably confident" the UK death toll would not exceed 20,000. Dr Gurdasani said the Imperial model was "widely accepted as an estimate of the likely death toll from unmitigated spread due to coronavirus, if no action was taken to control it".She added: "The government didn't overreact, but rather underreacted. Evidence suggests that waiting on lockdown in March cost tens of thousands of lives."Claim: Scientists suggested a third of the population would dieSir Rocco said the virus is "not the killer it was thought to be at the beginning", adding that "they were talking about a bubonic-type plague with a third of the population dying"."No credible scientist, or scientific publication has ever suggested that a third of the population will die from Covid-19," said Dr Gurdasani in response to Mr Forte's claim. "To suggest that scientists and modellers have been claiming this is false. We know the overall infection fatality rate is approximately 1% and varies with age."Reporting by Oliver Barnes, Anthony Reuben & Nicholas BarrettA SIMPLE GUIDE: How do I protect myself?AVOIDING CONTACT: The rules on self-isolation and exerciseWHAT WE DON'T KNOW How to understand the death toll TESTING: Can I get tested for coronavirus?LOOK-UP TOOL: Check cases in your areaWhat claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

View: Text | PDF Commentary Prolonged adaptive immune activation in COVID-19: implications for maintenance of long-term immunity? Text PDF Abstract Ongoing observational clinical research has prioritized understanding the human immune response to SARS-CoV-2 during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Several recent studies suggest that immune dysregulation with early and prolonged adaptive immune system activation can result in cellular exhaustion. In this issue of the JCI, Files et al. compared cellular immune phenotypes during the first two months of COVID-19 in hospitalized and less severe, non-hospitalized patients. The authors utilized flow cytometry to analyze circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Both patient cohorts maintained B and T cell phenotypes consistent with activation and cellular exhaustion throughout the first two months of infection. Additionally, follow-up samples from the non-hospitalized patient cohort showed that activation markers and cellular exhaustion increased over time. These findings illustrate the persistent nature of the adaptive immune system changes that have been noted in COVID-19 and suggest longer term effects that may shape the maintenance of immunity to SARS-CoV-2.

Options: View larger image (or click on image) Download as PowerPoint (A) In a typical influenza infection, symptoms and viral replication peak within a few days and resolve after the first week; serologic response peaks within the first two weeks and remains high. Notably, with influenza, the cellular immune activation peaks at week one and resolves by week three. (B) In contrast, with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the cellular immune system remains activated despite viral clearance. The persistence of viral antigens, development of T cell exhaustion, and increased risk of secondary infections set SARS-CoV-2 infection apart from other viral respiratory infections.

A man gets an influenza vaccine at a branch of the Korea Association of Health Promotion in Seoul, South Korea, October 23, 2020. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/File Photo Singapore has temporarily halted the use of two flu shots after about 59 people who received them in South Korea died. South Korea, on the other hand, indicated they would continue their state-run vaccination program because they did not find a direct link between the deaths and the vaccinations. No deaths linked to the vaccination have been reported in Singapore. The two influenza vaccinations are the SKYCellflu Quadrivalent, manufactured by South Korea’s SK Bioscience, and VaxigripTetra, manufactured by Paris-based Sanofi. The SKYCellflu shot is distributed locally by AJ Biologics, while the VaxigripTetra is distributed locally by Sanofi Aventis. Singapore has imported two other flu vaccines for the Northern Hemisphere 2020-21 flu season. South Korea urged its citizens to get the flu shots to decrease the odds of an outbreak while they are still battling the COVID-19 pandemic. Not surprisingly, public anxiety increased after the deaths, and last month, according to the South China Morning Post, almost 5 million doses were thrown out after not being stored at the appropriate temperatures. “Vaccination offers far greater benefits compared to side effects, and both the WHO and domestic and overseas experts agree,” stated Park Neung-hoo, South Korea’s Health Minister. According to the South Korean government, more than 1,500 elderly individuals died within seven days of receiving flu vaccines last year, but the deaths were not linked to the vaccines. This year, the country ordered 20% more flu vaccines over concerns about a so-called “twindemic,” of major flu and COVID-19 during the winter. Since South Korea’s vaccination program began in September, more than 9.4 million people have been inoculated, while only 1,154 have reported adverse reactions. South Korea’s vaccine program includes seven different influenza vaccines. The only two also available in Singapore are the SKYCellflu Quadrivalent and VaxigripTetra. The two others being ordered in Singapore are not currently being distributed in South Korea. Reports indicate the fatalities are mostly in people in their 70s and 80s. Sanofi issued a statement to Fierce Pharma, emphasizing the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (IDAC)’s investigations and the lack of a link between the deaths and the vaccines. South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in stated, “Do trust the health authorities’ conclusion … reached after a review with experts. There is a need to expand the influenza vaccination this year not only to prevent the flu, but also to ward off concurrent infection and spread of flu and COVID-19.” According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the most common flu vaccines administered in the U.S. are Afluria Quadrivalent, Fluarix Quadrivalent, FluLaval Quadrivalent, Fluzone Quadrivalent, Flucelvax Quadrivalent (for people four years and older), Flublok Quadrivalent (for people 18 years and older), Fluzone HighDose (licensed for people 65 years and older), FluMist Quadrivalent (given intranasally, approved for people 2 through 49 years of age). The CDC indicates it takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop against the virus. There is no evidence that the flu vaccine increases your risk of sickness from a coronavirus, such as the one that causes COVID-19. Few, if any, vaccines work 100% of the time, meaning that it’s possible that if you get a flu vaccine, you will still get the flu. It varies from year to year. The CDC notes, however, “flu vaccination has been shown in some studies to reduce severity of illness in people who get vaccinated but still get sick. A 2017 study showed that flu vaccination reduced deaths, intensive care unit (KCU) admissions, ICU length of stay, and overall duration of hospitalization among hospitalized adults with flu.” Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Email Print People Asia Mark Terry LATEST Alzheimer’s Leqembi, Kisunla and Beyond: The Next Wave of Alzheimer’s at CTAD 2024 November 11, 2024 · 6 min read · Kate Goodwin Huntington’s After Decades of Failure, First Disease-Modifying Huntington’s Treatment on the Horizon November 11, 2024 · 7 min read · Heather McKenzie Opinion Drugs Are Becoming “Smarter.” Here’s How November 11, 2024 · 6 min read · David Benshoof Klein Huntington’s 5 Huntington’s Therapies to Watch November 11, 2024 · 5 min read · Kate Goodwin Alzheimer’s disease Eisai Cuts Fiscal 2024 Guidance for Biogen-Partnered Leqembi as Sales Disappoint Analysts November 8, 2024 · 2 min read · Tristan Manalac FEATURED STORIES Editorial Lilly vs. Novo: The ‘He Said, She Said’ Row About Catalent’s GLP-1 Work November 8, 2024 · 4 min read · Greg Slabodkin Funding Navigating a Biotech Exit in a Rebounding Market November 6, 2024 · 8 min read · Ana Mulero Job trends Cell Therapy Biotechs Hunt for Autoimmune Expertise in Pivot From Oncology November 6, 2024 · 6 min read · Annalee Armstrong Business Lacks Family Lawsuits Seek Share of Profits Stemming from HeLa Cells November 5, 2024 · 7 min read · Sanjukta Mondal CAR T CAR T and Related Therapies Home In on Autoimmune Disease November 4, 2024 · 9 min read · Shawna Williams MORE ON THIS TOPIC China AstraZeneca’s China Head Taken Into Custody by Chinese Authorities: Reports November 8, 2024 · 2 min read · Tristan Manalac China Pfizer Makes $1B Commitment in China to Boost Innovation, Targets Chinese Market November 8, 2024 · 2 min read · Tristan Manalac Layoff Tracker Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Will Lay Off 45% of Employees November 7, 2024 · 176 min read · BioSpace Editorial Staff Layoffs Viracta Therapeutics Cuts 42% of Staff as Part of Resource Reprioritization November 7, 2024 · 2 min read · Angela Gabriel BioSpace is the digital hub for life science news and jobs.

The government is aiming to inoculate 19 million people – it is mostly targeting the elderly and younger people, the most vulnerable age groups – to avoid a feared twin epidemic of both Covid-19 and seasonal influenza. Over the past month, some 10 million Koreans have received flu shots.The authorities said the deaths have been coincidental to the vaccinations.“Following examinations, the KDCA has come to a conclusion that there is little causality between the recently increased report of deaths and anti-influenza vaccination”, the agency said in a statement on Thursday.It noted that the vaccines involved were not from any particular companies or batches of product, that the injections were made at many different medical facilities and that the deaths mostly occurred among the elderly aged 70 or older with pre-existing health conditions.AdvertisementThe Korea Medical Association issued a directive to its members to resume flu jabs on Friday after a week-long suspension it had earlier recommended on vaccine safety fears. The free vaccines are supplied by six South Korean companies and France‘s Sanofi, while privately supplied flu vaccines are manufactured locally by two South Korean companies and in Germany by UK-based multinational company GlaxoSmithKline.AdvertisementThe flu, a cold, allergies or COVID-19?

How to decipher symptoms Physician offers tips, stresses importance of getting the flu vaccine this year October 27, 2020 | By Kristin Samuelson COVID-19 Feinberg School of Medicine Global Health Let’s say you have a runny nose, headache and cough. Are they signs of COVID-19 or just a run-of-the-mill common cold? Northwestern University epidemiologist Dr. Sadiya Khan breaks down the symptoms for COVID-19 and how they compare to typical seasonal viruses and allergies, while also stressing the importance of getting a flu vaccine this year — something the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is recommending people do by October 31.“By getting a flu vaccine, you not only protect yourself, you boost your own immune system and protect others from the flu as well as a more severe illness if you were to contract both influenza and COVID-19,” said Dr. Khan, assistant professor of medicine and epidemiology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. “Getting vaccinated is especially important if you are pregnant or immunocompromised or have direct contact with someone who is.”Unlike allergies, the common cold, flu and COVID-19 are caused by infectious viruses that are contagious, Khan said."There are many symptoms of a ‘common cold,’ flu and COVID-19 that overlap, including fever, sneezing, cough and fatigue,” Khan said. “One symptom that seems to be unique to COVID-19 is a loss of sense of smell or taste. However, none of these symptoms are perfect to diagnose the cause of ‘cold-like’ symptoms, and the only way to know for sure is to get tested.”Allergies"While seasonal allergies can also sometimes cause overlapping symptoms, they are not infectious or contagious and don’t cause a fever. It also is highly likely that people experiencing allergy symptoms are familiar with them, as they likely have the same symptoms every fall and spring." Common symptoms include:Runny or stuffy nose Sneezing Itchy/scratchy throat Itchy eyes and Postnasal drainage Common cold"The common cold is caused by many different respiratory viruses. Some of these can be dangerous in young children, such as respiratory syncytial virus, and lead to hospitalization, but often cause mild symptoms in older children or adults lasting about two to three days. In contrast to the flu and COVID-19, the common cold is usually a mild illness." Common symptoms include:Runny or stuffy nose Sneezing Sore throat Cough Sinus congestion and Postnasal drainage The ‘flu’ “The ‘flu’ is caused by an influenza virus, which can cause mild to severe illness or even death." Common symptoms include:High fevers Sore throat Cough Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Muscle aches or weakness Fatigue and Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea COVID-19“COVID-19 is caused by a new virus called SARS-CoV-2 and can be asymptomatic or cause mild to severe illness and has contributed to more than 200,000 United States deaths this year. The best way to protect yourself from COVID-19 is to wear a mask outside your home, practice physical distancing and wash hands frequently."

The drive-up flu shot clinic is taking place at the high school, and families are encouraged to go online to www.bpsma.org/flushot to schedule appointments for their children.Linda Cahill, supervisor of nurses for the Brockton Public Schools, served as the interim executive health officer for the city amid the coronavirus pandemic this past spring and summer, witnessing first-hand the devastation it has caused in the community. Cahill said she's worried about the combined impact of this flu season and coronavirus pandemic. Brockton is currently classified in the "red" category on the state's color-coded coronavirus risk assessment map, with average daily cases nearing 15, and with a total of 5,160 COVID-19 cases since the pandemic began and 298 deaths."We need to work together to prevent twin pandemics and keep everyone safe and healthy,” Cahill said. “We know that for some of our families, this may be the first time their child will receive the flu shot and we understand that can be daunting. As both medical professionals and members of the Brockton Public Schools community, our multilingual nursing staff wants to be a source of information and support."We can deliver news just like this directly to your inbox.

It's customized to your preferences -- and it'll only take a few seconds.The Brockton school district said it already has 162 students booked for flu shot appointments at the drive-up clinic ahead of the first week of immunizations.The flu clinic is open on weekdays 10 a.m. through 6 p.m., and 8 a.m. through 4 p.m. on Saturdays. People can call Cahill for more information at 508-580-7470, and nurses who speak other languages are available, including French, Haitian Creole, Portuguese, Spanish and Cape Verdean Creole.CVS said it was happy to make sure the students of Brockton get flu shot. The initiative will help the city comply with an Aug. 19 announcement from state public health officials and Gov. Charlie Baker mandating influenza immunization by Dec. 31 for all children six months of age or older who are attending Massachusetts child care, pre-school, K-12, colleges and universities.The Baker administration said all students are expected to get the shot to attend classes unless either a medical or religious exemption is provided. The school district told parents that if they are seeking an exemption they should call their student's principal or school nurse.“Getting the shot protects both the individual and those around them who may be more vulnerable to serious complications from the flu," said Jon Wolowicz, district leader for CVS Pharmacy. “We’re pleased to be part of this effort to help the students of the Brockton school district get a flu shot."Families are asked to bring health insurance cards for their children to their appointments at the clinic, with no fee assessed for many healthcare plans. Those without insurance coverage will have to pay a bill to CVS, the school district said.The school district called the drive-up clinic a "quick and efficient way to get the immunization," encouraging every family to take advantage of the offer in order to help prevent a dark, deadly winter of the coronavirus combined with the flu."Every year, we have students and staff members who are out sick for days with a bad case of the flu," Cahill said. "But this year presents it's own challenges. We need to work together as a community to prevent twin pandemics."Staff writer Marc Larocque can be reached at mlarocque@enterprisenews.com.

Oct 28 Oct 28 Jane Phillips: Kinston and the Spanish Flu pandemic - 1918-1919 Jane Phillips Columns I’ve read that 1918 was one of the worst years throughout recorded history. The First World War was raging in Europe while an unseen enemy, the Spanish Flu, was spreading across the earth. The illness began in the spring and seemed to subside during the summer months. It lasted until late 1919 and consisted of “waves” of varying intensity. World War I claimed an estimated 16 million lives. According to the CDC website, it is estimated that about 500 million people or one-third of the world’s population became infected with this virus. The number of deaths was estimated to be at least 50 million worldwide with about 675,000 occurring in the United States.Initially, there was just very little dependable information. The general public felt that officials were not being forthcoming about the severity of the situation. But the leaders really knew so little about the virus. They just didn’t know for sure what to say. But many precautions were put on place including wearing a face mask.The Spanish Flu hit hard and health systems were simply overrun. There were shortages of beds, supplies, doctors and especially nurses. Since there was no vaccine or cure, the most effective course of treatment was isolation and bed-rest. In many communities’ bodies literally piled up with no place to put them, and some families were forced to live for a while with deceased relatives still in the home. It was learned Influenza spread when people were in close contact, so local health officers moved swiftly to close public schools and colleges, churches, theaters, fairs, bars, dance halls and public meetings. Stores, textile mills, and other businesses also closed. Employees were either sick, afraid of getting sick, or at home taking care of the sick. Few communities escaped the pandemic, and even fewer had the resources to care for the sick. Hospitals were not large enough to handle all the patients, so temporary hospitals opened in churches, schools, and armories. Doctors were so busy they could not answer all of the calls of those affected, especially in farming communities. Many people in those days had no indoor plumbing. Health authorities told everyone to, “bury everything as deep as possible in the ground." During its peak in October 1918, it’s been said there were only two kinds of people in the state—those who were sick with influenza and those who were trying to save them. The illness sometimes lasted seven to ten days. It hit suddenly with chills, a high fever, upset stomach, weakness, and other symptoms. Influenza struck without regard to class or race, but the majority of victims were young adults between the ages of twenty and forty. Pregnant women had an especially hard time. I have found no source that Kinston experienced any effect during the first wave of the flu. The second wave of the virus was much more deadly and struck with a vengeance. The first victim of the Spanish Flu Pandemic I have found in Kinston was in late summer 1918. The victim was State Sen. William Durward Pollock. William was married to the lovely daughter of the late Gen. Robert Hoke who by the end of the Civil War had become one of General Lee’s favored generals. Pollock was a 56-year-old attorney, legislator, political leader, writer and renowned as an orator. He was well known around town as well as the state. Mr. Pollock had traveled on “the Mullet Line,” officially the Atlantic and North Carolina Railroad, to Morehead City, a small fishing port at the time, to address a Liberty Loan rally. Upon returning home, he came down with a high fever. He was treated by his brother and brother-in-law, both prominent physicians. He had been so sick that when he died, he did not know about his newborn daughter. He is buried in Maplewood Cemetery. In October the height of the Spanish Flu Pandemic was in full swing in Kinston. Three died that first week. There were some days when 15 to 20 victims died. Dr. Bud Hyatt set up an emergency hospital in the old Kinston High School on N. East Street near Vernon Avenue. All schools closed because of the flu. Each issue of the Free Press listed names of citizens who had died since the last issue. By mid-October over 2700 cases had been reported in Lenoir County.Oct. 12, 1918: Dr. James Parrott Of Parrott Memorial Hospital opened that private institution to influenza sufferers and stated that all doctors were invited to send patients there. This move was a public-spirited one and elicited a complimentary comment from the town’s other physicians. One physician said he had over 100 cases on his list. North Carolina’s medical facilities typically “were overwhelmed by the masses of sick and dying.” The Kinston Daily Free Press article, Oct. 14, 1918, at the height of the Spanish Flu Pandemic of 1918 gave good advice and it is still good advice today, “BE CALM! It is true we, along with the Nation at large, are facing a serious situation. Our hearts are torn because of the many sad bereavements in our midst. But this is no time to show the "white feather" or become panicky. Let us be brave, looking to our Heavenly Father for guidance and strength. For He alone can give succor and comfort in a time like this. Let us not give up hope because the epidemic reaches us. Proper precaution has proven most effective in producing quick recoveries.Let's be careful, calm and cooperative until the dark cloud passes.” By the end of the third week, the white undertaker and his assistant were overcome by the flu and exhaustion. They had tended the bodies and buried dozens over the past three weeks. When they could go on no longer the colored undertaker volunteered at the white establishment and managed until the white undertaker was better. By the end of the month, almost 150 were dead. The deaths were now beginning to slow down. A letter written by Evaline Hill in Snow Hill (located about 15 miles from Kinston) to her daughter on October 16, 1918. “I have never known the like in my life - so many sick folks.” Throughout the letter she refers to many friends, neighbors and family members being sick with the flu or had died with the flu. Among some of the names were.; Harrison, Wooten, Jones, Hardy, Sullivan and Sutton. Evaline tells of many taken Johnson’s Chill Tonic.Members of my family that lived in nearby Jones County became very ill with the flu. Mama Jarman went to help her sick sister. A short time after she returned to her home she and her children came down with the flu. A kind neighbor would bring pots of soup and other food for them and leave it on a fence post. Papa Jarman was the only one that did not get sick while Mama Jarman almost died. Finally, Mama Jarman and the children recovered and the memory of that time lived with them for the rest of their lives. By early November the second and worse wave of the flu in Kinston had passed. As lethal as the second wave was, mercifully it was short-lived. Approximately 20% of the infected victims contracted a mild case and recovered without much problem.December saw another wave of the Spanish Flu as it made another visit throughout Lenoir County. Over 60% of the 200 residents of Caswell Training School were taken ill and many died. During the Christmas season illness and death had again spread about the community. There was a sadness that covered the town. Finally, by the end of December, the outbreak slowly improved. There had been several hundred cases bur fewer deaths than in October. By the close of 1918, the worst months of the pandemic had passed. North Carolina soldiers in France had carefully followed reports of the flu at home through letters and newspapers. Many soldiers who faced death daily at the front mourned relatives who had died an ocean away from the war. In April 1919, Dr. William Rankin, the Secretary of the State Board of Health and a noted proponent of health education, reported the death of over 13,600 North Carolinians from influenza and estimated that approximately 1,000,000 of North Carolina's 2.5 million inhabitants had caught the disease. Nationally, the disease killed almost 700,000, and some estimates suggest anywhere from 50 to 100 million died worldwide.The tremendous death toll and sick victims of the Spanish Flu was a major factor in the need to update and modernize health services. Many new hospitals were built and health education became very important.SOURCES: www.archives.gov/exhibits/influenza-epidemic/Job Jarman Family HistoryEveline Hill LetterKinston Free Press (numerous articles)Influenza Outbreak of 1918-1919 by Steve Case, revised by Lisa Gregory, 2010 Public Health; Infectious Diseases; Influenza outbreak of 1918-1919; NC and Influenza (WWI); Public Health; Infectious Diseases WWI: North Carolina and Influenza by Tom BeltonNorth Carolina.

October 29, 2020 Clinical Contributors to this story: Thomas Bader, M.D. Updated 09/28/23 The best way to lower your risk of getting influenza is going for a flu shot before flu season begins. We talked to Thomas Bader, M.D., vice president of medical quality at Hackensack Meridian Health about when it’s the right time to get a flu shot. Here’s what he had to say: Timing Your Flu Shot The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that all adults and children older than 6 months in age should get flu shots annually. The timing is important: September and October are generally good times to be vaccinated against flu. Ideally, everyone should be vaccinated by the end of October. Cases of the flu typically peak between December and February, but the influenza virus spreads differently every year, usually beginning in November, sometimes going as late as April or May. Going for a flu shot too early – may backfire, because it may not protect you for the entire flu season. However, it isn’t too late to get a flu shot after October, if the month comes and goes and you don’t get vaccinated. A belated flu shot offers protection for the remainder of the flu season. Why to Get a Flu Shot Early in the Fall It’s better to get vaccinated during early fall than later in the season, because the longer you wait, the more likely you are to be exposed to the virus without having the vaccine in your system. Getting vaccinated doesn’t provide you with instant protection. Your immune system needs about two weeks to develop antibodies to the flu shot, which help to protect you from the flu. Roughly two weeks after you receive your flu shot, your immune system should be prepared to face off the flu for roughly four to six months. “A flu shot may offer some protection if you’re exposed to the flu during the first few days after your vaccination, but it will be most protective after your body has time to develop antibodies,” says Dr. Bader. You can get a flu shot at several locations, including: your doctor’s office a walk-in clinic at work (some employers may offer this onsite) a local flu shot clinic Why to Get a Flu Shot & COVID Vaccine COVID-19 cases are expected to continue to rise during the cold-weather months, which coincides with flu season. By getting a flu shot and COVID vaccine, you’ll lower your chances of getting severely ill from these viruses.

(Photo by Terry Pierson, The Press-Enterprise/SCNG) By Allyson Vergara | avergara@scng.comUPDATED: October 30, 2020 at 7:41 PM PSTNearly 40 burros, or wild donkeys, have died from an equine influenza outbreak in Riverside County, the county’s Department of Animal Services said Friday, Oct. 30.The deaths, first seen in mid-October, occurred mostly in the Reche Canyon area, near Moreno Valley and Colton. About six deaths occurred in Moreno Valley, in the foothills along Pigeon Pass Road, Heacock Street/Reche Vista Drive and Redlands Boulevard, a county news release states.Most of the deaths are young burros, said John Welsh, spokesman for the Department of Animal Services. The burros are more susceptible to illnesses such as influenza because they are not vaccinated, Welsh said.San Bernardino County officials did not report any cases, officials said. That count is expected to rise, the release states.Equine influenza, an upper-respiratory viral infection found in horses and members of the horse family — including burros, mules and donkeys — is one of the most contagious infections, spread rapidly through aerosolized droplets and by coughing, according to the American Association of Equine Practitioners.DonkeyLand, a rescue center near Colton, tends Friday, Oct. 30, 2020, to burros suffering from equine influenza.

As of Friday, most have been released.“I’ve witnessed at least 50 free-roaming wild burros coughing. These burros are from various herds in the wild,” said DonkeyLand founder Amber-LeVonne Cheatham, who helps rescue and rehabilitate many of the sick and dying animals.Cheatham, whose facility can take about 100 of the animals, said the priority is separating sick burros from healthy ones. Animal Services officials said it was uncertain how many burros live in the hills between Riverside and San Bernardino counties, but estimate there are roughly 500.

County experts said that clinical signs are more common and severe in younger horses — ages 1 to 5 — and possibly more severe in donkeys and mules. Older horses usually have milder disease.The virus, they said, does not affect humans or other animal species.Dr. Alisha Olmstead, a veterinarian with the California Department of Food and Agriculture in Ontario, said in the news release that influenza is one of the most common infectious diseases of the respiratory tract of horses, and there are vaccines on the market.Dr. Paul Wan, a veterinarian with the SoCal Equine Hospital in Norco, said “the viral infection in their lungs get so bad, and they die from pneumonia and suffocate.”Wan, who also works with the ailing burros at DonkeyLand, said that there isn’t a “flu season” for equine animals, but that these outbreaks happen in cycles.When wild animals gather and get pushed together, especially in limited undeveloped areas, “high spikes of diseases” occur.“Most of the time (it affects) the young ones, because their immune system is not as well developed,” he said.

He suggested that horse owners should be aware of their animals’ temperature.Riverside County, state, and animal department officials monitoring the outbreak urged horse owners to move their animals away from fence lines, especially if they are in areas where burros frequent, and to consult their veterinarians. If possible, they should get booster vaccines for previously vaccinated horses, not let guests near a horse and avoid travel if a horse may have been exposed. This will help avoid transmission of the virus on clothing, equipment, brushes, shared water buckets, hands, the release states.A Riverside County ordinance bars the public from feeding the burros.The county is receiving help from California Department of Food and Agriculture veterinarians, DonkeyLand Rescue, Moreno Valley Animal Services, and San Bernardino County Animal Care & Control.

In this time of uncertainty, their leadership is a shining example of the actions that are needed to keep our community safe.” Each year Peterborough Public Health produces a report on health care worker flu immunization rates focusing on those who work in long-term care facilities (LTCF), retirement residences, and at Peterborough Regional Health Centre (PRHC). For the 2019-2020 flu season, the median rate of flu shot uptake by staff at LTCF increased 3.1% over the previous year. The staff immunization rate at PRHC also showed a significant gain last year, growing by 8.8%, bringing their cumulative increase over the past two influenza seasons to 18.5%. Dr. Salvaterra noted this impressive jump in immunizations rates is a result of PRHC’s effective coordination of several internal programs plus incentivizing staff to get their flu shot. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) considers the provision of influenza vaccination to be an essential component of the standard of care for all HCWs for the protection of their patients. During the 2019-2020 season there were three influenza outbreaks in total reported in LTCFs, retirement residences, and at PRHC, compared to 10 total influenza outbreaks in these settings the previous season. This year’s flu vaccine has already been made available to health care workers and is currently publicly available through pharmacies and health care providers. Please see the chart below for a comparison of influenza immunization rates by local long-term care facility and retirement home. LTCF and hospitals are required by the Ministry of Health to report these rates annually to local public health agencies; this is optional for retirement residences. Peterborough Public Health provides support to facilities who experienced a decrease in influenza immunization rates and is exploring strategies to address this.

Herbert Taylor was 23 when a dangerous flu spread through soldier ranks during World War I, nearly a century ago, and wiped out thousands a day. The Southern Jewish Archives of the William Breman Jewish Heritage Museum records the history of the 92-year-old Atlanta native, recalling his service during the war and his encounter with what became a global pandemic. Taylor was training at Camp McLellan in Alabama and was supposed to head to Camp Dix in New Jersey when the “flu” broke out. “We lost 2,000 men a day to the flu. When the flu was over, we didn’t have enough men left … So they sent us back to Camp Gordon” in Atlanta, according to an interview conducted in 1987 through the Cuba Family Archives. The history captured by the Atlanta museum, along with national Jewish organizations and public health records, bears an uncanny resemblance to what the Jewish community and the world is experiencing today. It helps to put our present global health crisis in perspective to read about the pandemic that occurred soon after the turn of the 20th century. Get The AJT Newsletter by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up In a footnote of the transcript from the Taylor interview, the flu of that time was further defined as the 1918/1919 flu pandemic or the Spanish flu. “In the U.S. it first appeared in a military camp in Kansas. Ironically the close concentration of large numbers of soldiers in training camps for World War I hastened the pandemic and increased the transmission of it. It returned in a second wave in 1918, which proved even deadlier than the first.” Photos courtesy of the Breman Jewish Heritage Museum // Gisela Meyer Spielberg Family Papers // Heinrich (Henry) Meyer, second from right, standing, as a German soldier in World War I. Circa 1918-19. The pandemic raged from January 1918 to December 1920, according to the transcript footnote. “It was one of the deadliest natural disasters in human history. Ultimately it infected 500 million people worldwide, of which some 50 million … died. It was especially fatal to young adults,” according to the transcript footnotes. Those figures are a far cry from the latest figures from 2020, showing nearly 43.5 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide and 1.2 million deaths. Still, some of the reports from 1918 are eerily familiar to what is occurring in 2020. From the archives of the JDC (Joint Distribution Committee), a Jewish relief agency, we learn that fundraising had to be suspended due to the restrictions of the health care authorities concerning “an unusually deadly influenza pandemic that affected JDC operations domestically and overseas as well.” On Oct. 8, 1918, JDC admitted that on account of “the epidemic of Spanish Influenza . . . it would be impossible to get together the crowd at the meeting scheduled in New York.” The Epstein School was among schools that reopened for the fall after being closed and operating virtually for several months during the pandemic. On Dec. 11, 1918, Harry Plous, a member of the Upper Peninsula Organizing Committee, informed JDC’s Secretary Albert Lucas, “We are getting ready for that great relief campaign, but on account of the Spanish Influenza, we are going to make a big stop in this work. It is not allowed to hold, not only mass meetings but not even four persons can assemble.” Elsewhere around the country in 1918, the Spanish flu was also wreaking havoc in the Jewish community. The National Institutes of Health reported in a 2010 article entitled, “Immigration, Ethnicity, and the Pandemic,” that the “Spanish influenza epidemic of 1918” was arousing fears of anti-Semitism within the Jewish immigrant community. “History had taught Jewish spokespeople that they must at all costs deflect blame for the pandemic away from Jewish immigrants less they trigger the sort of medicalized anti-Semitism they had left Eastern Europe to escape,” Alan Kraut, who had a doctorate from the American University history department, wrote in the NIH report. “At the same time, the health and safety of the people had to be protected by discussing disease prevention in every available public forum. In Denver, public health officers praised the Jewish community for its compliance.” That praise came despite the high cost of medical care at the time. “Although physicians held a place of great admiration and respect among Eastern European Jews, physician care was a luxury that few could afford,” according to Kraut’s reporting. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention // The Boston Red Cross during the pandemic. What would happen in communities with higher concentrations of Eastern European Jewish immigrants? In the fall of 1918, a primary task of the 20-year-old Jewish Daily Forward newspaper, New York’s Yiddish-language daily also known as Forverts, was to explain the illness to the Jewish immigrant community and why cases must be reported. Kraut wrote, “The paper warned, ‘Influenza is often the prelude to pneumonia, which ends very often with death.’ Noting that previously flu need not be reported, the article emphasized, ‘The Health Commissioner has ordered that from now on, doctors should report on every case of influenza and pneumonia, exactly as they do for [other] contagious illnesses.’ Likewise, the Forward kept its readers apprised of the epidemic’s spread.” On Sept. 21, the Forward “informed readers that 47 new cases had been reported to the New York Board of Health, but that the Commissioner had been reassuring nevertheless and explained that meetings were being held to prevent the flu’s transmission. Meanwhile, the Forward advised readers to ‘be cautious; if anyone should sneeze, he should not sneeze into someone’s face, but into a handkerchief.’ Such advice did not consider the obvious. For impoverished immigrants, many from rural villages, standards of etiquette and urban hygiene were still lessons to be learned. Not everyone owned a handkerchief.” Tony Dejak, Associated Press // Testing for COVID-19 in Ohio in mid-March. Cases continued to mount and almost every issue of the Forward included new rules on flu prevention, Kraut wrote. The paper “advised readers to not use hand towels in public places and not to drink from cups that others had used. Knowing the popularity of candy stores and soda fountains in immigrant neighborhoods, Yiddish-speaking Jews were reminded, ‘Above all you should in particular be careful in ice-cream soda places: do not drink if the glass has not been completely and appropriately cleaned.’ There were warnings against public spitting and using ‘any napkins, handkerchiefs, clothes or bedding that an ill person has used.’ In a community where many smoked, pipe smokers were reminded, ‘Do not smoke from a pipe that has been in another’s mouth.’ While few Jewish immigrant households in this era had their own telephones, many used public phones and were reminded, ‘When you speak on the telephone, keep your mouth farther from the receiver.’ “These were familiar words of advice, not unlike reminders designed to avoid transmission of tuberculosis, the bane of impoverished immigrants. Children were of special concern and readers were cautioned, ‘Do not let your child play with things that belong to other children.’” In October 1918, all stores except food stores were ordered to close no later than 4 p.m., Kraut’s NIH report continued. The Board of Health ordered that landlords were legally required to provide heat to tenants by Nov. 1. “Each home in the city must now be heated. It is a danger for people who are recovering from influenza and pneumonia to be in cold houses. Cold residences also encourage the development of the sickness,” the order stated, as reported by Kraut. While the Forward was skeptical of the government response to the pandemic, the Jewish community, known for being self-sufficient, particularly in the face of anti-Semitism, mobilized to help their own, according to Kraut. “At the time of the influenza epidemic, New York’s Jewish community had formed a kehillah, a communal organization to govern itself. … Although it only lasted from 1908 to 1922, the New York Kehillah published the names of 65 Jewish organizations in New York where help and information were available during the influenza epidemic. One such organization, the Workmen’s Circle or Arbeiter Ring, offered medical assistance to its members and their families. Getty Images // Like today, people wore face masks to work in 1918 to protect against the spread of influenza. “Funerals were an equally important matter. Observant Jews must be buried in sacred ground separate from non-Jews. In the fall of 1918, the Workmen’s Circle appointed its first funeral director to watch over the growing number of funerals of flu-stricken members in the Greater New York area wanting to be buried in Workmen Circle cemeteries. During the height of the epidemic, there were 14 to 16 funerals a day among Circle members, an unprecedented daily toll. “Religious organizations in the immigrant communities also sought to protect their communities. Many churches agreed to remain closed during the epidemic or increased the number of masses to spread out the congregation and prevent opportunities for infection. In the Jewish community, the head of the rabbinic court or Beis Din of New York announced that Jews in mourning who must sit shiva ‘can and must be lenient with regard to the laws of mourning.’ Mourners were required by Jewish law to stay at home, do no work or domestic tasks, or even change clothes or bathe. However, because of the flu, mourners were told, ‘He who lives in narrow rooms or such a one who must have fresh air may go around outside for a few hours each day on account of health.’ The bereaved were told they could buy food and need not go barefoot, ‘even at home, but wear shoes in order not to catch a cold. God forbid.’” Towards the end of the pandemic, in October 1920, JDC medical advisor Dr. Harry Plotz prepared a report about his trip to Eastern Europe in which he visited and inspected health conditions of cities, orphanages, schools and refuge camps in Poland, Lithuania and Ukraine. “The presence of an epidemic in one region is a menace to the world, as the influenza epidemic has already taught us,” Plotz wrote in a letter recorded in the JDC Archives. He was speaking specifically about the control and eradication of typhus fever, which he believed “would be accomplished by worldwide cooperation, a plan which I hardly think feasible at this time.” After months of delaying and rescheduling simchas, some resumed by taking health precautions such as being held outdoors or requiring masks. Arthur Oysgelt and Alyse Finkel surrounded by family June 14 in Congregation B’nai Torah’s garden. If today’s health battles seem daunting, consider that back some 100 years ago, the “Spanish influenza” was just one of a string of maladies afflicting the globe. For instance, a report of the activities of the American Zionist Medical Unit between 1918 and 1920, significantly subsidized by JDC, presented a desperate situation in Palestine, according to its archives. “Shortly after arrival of the Unit in Palestine a cholera epidemic broke out in Tiberias,” the report to the JDC stated. “The military authorities took hold of the situation energetically … There were at the time about 7,500 people in Tiberias, 4,000 resident Jews, 1,100 Jewish refugees from Jaffe, 2,000 Muslims and 3,000 Christians. To meet the needs of this population afflicted with endemic meningitis, Spanish influenza, malaria, dysentery and other gastro-intestinal disturbances, and the usual eye diseases, a polyclinic was opened.” And we think we have a massive global health crisis today. read more: William Breman Jewish Heritage Museum Camp Dix Camp McLellan jewish community history World War I Herbert Taylor COVID-19 Corona Coronavirus Upper Peninsula Organizing Committee Albert Lucas Spanish Flu Joint Distribution Committee Center for Disease Control and Prevention CDC pandemic Facebook Twitter email Print comments November 11, 2024 Right Now Education How to Reprogram Kids Away from Electronics By Marcia Caller Jaffe Dr. Pip Spandorfer coaches parents on methods to implement healthy digital habits and reduce overall family anxiety.

YonhapBy Bahk Eun-jiPublic fear surrounding the seasonal flu vaccine is prompting more consumers look for imported flu shots in anticipation that these would be safer than ones produced by local pharmaceutical companies. As a result, local news outlets are reporting that there is now a shortage of imported vaccines. Seventy deaths have been reported among those getting free influenza vaccinations, but despite the government announcing that there was no proof that these were caused by the flu shots, public concern about the safety of the vaccines hasn't subsided. Out of 12 flu vaccines available in Korea, 10 are made by Korean companies and two by foreign ones. Those used in the government's free shot program were from LG Chemical, Boryung Biopharma, GC Pharma, Korea Vaccine, SK Bioscience and Sanofi Pasteur.These companies have joined the free vaccination program despite an anticipated loss ― although the government is paying 60 percent of the market price. On the other hand, GSK and Dong-A ST did not participate in the vaccination program ― GSK is a foreign pharmaceutical company.Experts and officials in the pharmaceutical industry say there is no difference in safety and efficacy between domestic and imported vaccines. The ingredients and distribution processes are all similar."Although participation in the government's free vaccination program is not profitable, we took part in the program this year for the sake of public health," an official from a domestic pharmaceutical company was quoted as saying by Newsis. "As more people received free vaccinations, the chances of the vaccine being killed have increased. Nevertheless, I am worried that some people think that only GSK products or imported vaccines are safe."Another official from the pharmaceutical industry said, "In particular, Boryung Biopharma imports the undiluted solution of the vaccine from Sanofi. The raw material itself is an imported vaccine," he said. "It does not make sense to specify safety and effectiveness by dividing it into domestic products and imported ones."The causal relationship between death and vaccine is also judged to be low. On Oct. 29, the Korea Disease Prevention and Control Agency announced that the number of people who died after getting a flu shot this year increased to 70, but there was no causality linked to the vaccination. Among the deaths, 86.1% of the people were in their 70s or older.The official expressed regret that the government's announcement of the deaths played a part in raising the fear of the flu vaccine."The government has announced every time there are reports of death that the association between the deaths and vaccination has not been identified. In the process, the public had no choice but to believe that it was a serious accident after watching the news," he said. "If there was a real problem with the vaccine, it would not have been administered for nearly 70 years. Similar adverse reactions were found in many patients who received the vaccine, leading to death," he continued."Every year, thousands of people die from the flu. We are worried that people will not be inoculated in the prescribed period due to such excessive fear, which will have a negative impact on public health." ejb@koreatimes.co.kr More articles by this reporter Most Read in National 12 umbrella unions stage large-scale rallies in Seoul 2Korea to launch economic consultative bodies to brace for Trump 2.0 3Concerns grow over AI textbooks as digital dependence increases among students 4Yoon grapples with growing unpopularity at halfway mark 5Fire erupts at POSCO Pohang plant; 1 worker injured Top 10 Stories 1Have you ever been to a Korean wedding? 2Korea to launch economic consultative bodies to brace for Trump 2.0 3SK chief wins chance to challenge $986 mil. divorce settlement 4Concerns grow over AI textbooks as digital dependence increases among students 5Korean essay on 'ramyeon' to be published in UK 6Lotte, Shinsegae in limelight after Trump win 7Putin finalizes N.

REUTERS A patient getting an influenza vaccination at a hospital in Seoul, South Korea, on Oct 21, 2020. Published October 31, 2020 Updated November 1, 2020 Bookmark Bookmark Share WhatsApp Telegram Facebook Twitter Email LinkedIn SINGAPORE — Healthcare providers and medical practitioners can resume the use of two influenza vaccines – SKYCellflu Quadrivalent and VaxigripTetra – said the Ministry of Health on Saturday (Oct 31). The MOH said that these vaccines have been assessed to be safe for use following a “thorough review of the information” from South Korean health authorities as well as Singapore’s Health Sciences Authority’s (HSA). On Oct 25, the MOH had issued an advisory to medical practitioners to temporarily cease the use of these two vaccines, which were among seven brands of influenza vaccines linked to nine deaths in South Korea. In its statement on Saturday, MOH said that based on information release by South Korean health authorities on Oct 29, the likelihood of a causal link between influenza vaccination and the deaths reported was determined to be low. Investigations revealed that the causes of death for 71 of the 72 deaths reported were highly likely due to underlying diseases while the remaining case is pending investigations. The South Korean health authorities also found that no vaccine from any particular manufacturer was associated with higher rates of reported deaths than the others, said MOH.It added that HSA has also reviewed the reports of patients locally having adverse reactions, as well as the global safety data of the two vaccines. Several patients in Singapore who were given the vaccines experienced mild symptoms, such as nausea or rash, after receiving the jab.“The reported adverse events for the two vaccines are consistent with the known safety profile of influenza vaccines,” said MOH. “In addition, HSA has reviewed the test reports of all batches of the two vaccines supplied in Singapore and based on the available data, the two vaccines distributed in Singapore meet the quality standards.”It added that like any medicine, vaccines can have side effects. Common side effects from influenza vaccination may include soreness and redness at the injection site, fever, headaches, muscle aches, fatigue and nausea. These side effects are generally mild and resolve on their own, it said. In rare instances, an individual may experience high fever or allergic reactions such as breathing difficulty, wheezing and swelling around the eyes.Immediate medical attention should be sought in these instances, said MOH. It also strongly advised vulnerable groups such as the elderly, the young, pregnant women and those with certain pre-existing medical conditions, to receive their influenza vaccinations for their health and well-being. In a statement on Nov 1, Sanofi Pasteur, the manufacturer of VaxigripTetra, said it has always stood by its influenza vaccine."All batches of VaxigripTetra are manufactured in full compliance with high-quality international standards and processes of Sanofi Pasteur; they all undergo rigorous internal quality control testing and are controlled in France by an independent Official Medicine Control Laboratory acting on behalf of the European Medicines Agency before importation to Singapore," the company said.

They stopped using the vaccine following an advisory from the Ministry of Health (MOH), which also advised temporarily ceasing use of a second vaccine.While some doctors have checked in on their patients or received inquiries from those concerned about possible complications, others are waiting for more information from MOH, various clinics told TODAY on Tuesday (Oct 27).MOH issued an advisory on Sunday to healthcare providers and medical practitioners to temporarily stop the use of SkyCellflu Quadrivalent, manufactured by SK Bioscience and locally distributed by AJ Biologics, and VaxigripTetra, manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur and locally distributed by Sanofi Aventis.According to the South Korean health authorities, these two brands of vaccines, along with five others not available in Singapore, were administered to individuals who died there.Eight out of 14 doctors with whom TODAY spoke said that they do not use either of the vaccines.Six of them said that they had administered Vaxigrip Tetra previously — although only three had done so recently. No patients have reported side effects from the vaccine. None of the 14 doctors has used SkyCellflu Quadrivalent.Dr Ong Eng Keow from the International Child and Adolescent Clinic at Mount Alvernia Hospital said that the clinic had administered about 50 Vaxigrip Tetra vaccines since Oct 4.“We contacted all our patients to check on their condition and they are all well,” he said on Monday, adding that he had been most concerned about patients who got the jab recently.Dr Choo Kay Wee, from A Life Clinic at Novena Medical Centre, has administered fewer than 10 Vaxigrip Tetra vaccines in the last six months.Dr Sunil Kumar Joseph, who runs Tayka Medical Family Clinic in Jurong, said he had also administered fewer than 10 shots of the vaccine in the first half of this year, but none since then.Neither doctor has seen patients coming back with complications.Dr Joseph said he has not reached out to patients to inform them about the MOH temporary cessation advisory of the two vaccines as he is still waiting for more information from MOH.“MOH is investigating the situation to see whether this is really warranted, or were there other issues that were not linked to the vaccine that may have caused those deaths (in Korea),” Dr Joseph added. “Let people investigate first before we alarm the patients.”Some doctors said they have received inquiries from concerned patients since Monday.Dr Lim Kien Sin from Clarion Medical Clinic in Ang Mo Kio said that the clinic received inquiries from patients even though it only started vaccinating last week — using different brands — and does not use either of the two vaccines that are the subject of the MOH advisory."The same few patients that we vaccinated gave us a call. We reassured them, and they were still quite all right," said Dr Lim.TODAY contacted two private hospitals, Farrer Park Hospital and Thomson Medical Centre, which both said that they do not administer the two vaccines.COMMON SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE SWELLING, MILD PAINThe doctors said there are several common side effects from vaccinations, such as mild pain at the injection site, swelling, rashes, mild body aches and fatigue.Dr Lim said patients may also develop mild cough and cold symptoms, but this reaction usually resolves itself quickly.“Most importantly, we look out for fever within the first 24 to 48 hours,” he said, adding that this is another common side effect of vaccinations.Some patients may develop allergic reactions, the doctors said.Dr Elaine Chua from Bedok Medical Centre said side effects such as rashes must be assessed in case the recipient of the vaccine has allergies to it.Dr Lee Joon Loong from Paddington Medical Clinic in Bedok said that in severe cases, allergies can result in an anaphylactic shock — where their blood pressure suddenly drops and airways narrow, possibly blocking normal breathing.In some cases, patients may feel numbness in their hands and feet after they are vaccinated, which can progressively move to more limbs, said Dr Chua.This rare complication is called the Guillain-Barre syndrome, said Mount Alvernia’s Dr Ong, adding that patients may feel a weakness of muscles in response to influenza vaccines.Referring to the various side effects that might be expected following a vaccination, Dr Chua said pain that is made tolerable with mild over-the-counter painkillers, such as pain on the injection site, is acceptable.However, patients who develop more painful symptoms must be assessed by a doctor.“Apart from the common side effects, the healthcare provider who administered the vaccine should be alerted to everything else,” said Dr Chua. She added that the healthcare provider must examine the patient to determine whether the side effect will progress and, if so, alert the Health Sciences Authority.TODAY has sought comment from MOH.

MOH had earlier called for the temporary cessation of the use of the vaccines after people who received them in South Korea died. In a release on Saturday, MOH said that based on information released by the South Korean health authorities on Oct 29, the likelihood that the vaccines had caused the deaths was low. Rather, the causes of death for 71 of the 72 people who died were highly likely due to underlying diseases, while the last case is still under investigation. The South Korean health authorities also found that no vaccine from any particular manufacturer was associated with higher rates of reported deaths than the others. In the statement, MOH said that the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) here had reviewed local adverse event reports as well as global safety data of the two vaccines and found them consistent with the known safety profile of influenza vaccines in general. HSA also reviewed the test reports of all batches of the two vaccines supplied in Singapore and found that they meet quality standards. MOH said that healthcare providers here have already been told that they can continue to offer these vaccines, as well as other vaccines available here for the Northern Hemisphere 2020-2021 influenza season. However, the ministry acknowledged that like any medicine, influenza vaccines can have side effects.

Back to the topBonn: pharmacies run out of flu vaccine General-Anzeiger Bonn Hauptmenü Bonn Region News Sport Freizeit Ratgeber Kultur Newsletter ePaper Abo Abo StartseiteGA-EnglishNewsBonn: pharmacies run out of flu vaccine Delivery bottlenecks Bonn pharmacies run out of flu vaccine Bonn · Bonn is running out of flu vaccine. Many pharmacies in the city have long waiting lists - with up to 40 customers in some cases. The North Rhine Pharmacists' Association sees "very large bottlenecks". 27.10.2020 , 10:01 Uhr The vaccine is difficult to obtain, confirms Ute Schneider-Jacobs from the Burg-Apotheke pharmacy in Bad Godesberg. Photo: Benjamin Westhoff Foto: Benjamin Westhoff Besides corona, it is an additional danger for the elderly, chronically ill and pregnant women: the flu. At a press event about a fortnight ago, Health Minister Jens Spahn had been vaccinated against it and said afterwards that 26 million doses had been ordered - more than ever before. However, they would not be available all at once, which could lead to local supply bottlenecks. "But we have no supply bottlenecks", said Spahn. "We no longer have any vaccine doses against influenza," said the owner of a pharmacy in downtown Bonn. She has 40 people on the waiting list. She could not say when new vaccine doses would arrive. "Supposedly in mid or late November.“ Hospitals in Bonn and the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis are expanding their isolation areas Intensive care beds in the region Hospitals in Bonn and the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis are expanding their isolation areas Maria Di Rosa-Ponert and her husband have also not yet been able to get vaccinated against flu. She writes to the GA: "We had ourselves put on the waiting list at the beginning of October. Last Saturday, she asked again at the pharmacy. "They could not tell me when the vaccine would arrive. But it will be processed according to the list and risk groups. Like the pharmacy in the city centre, many people are feeling the same. Only recently, in a survey of 400 pharmacies, the North Rhine-Westphalian Pharmacists' Association stated that there were "very serious bottlenecks" with the vaccine. Almost all of the pharmacies surveyed had indicated availability as "poor" or "very poor". Ute Schneider-Jacobs is the Bonn press spokesperson for the association and runs a pharmacy in Bad Godesberg. She can confirm for Bonn what the Association found in its survey. A survey by the GA of pharmacies in Bonn confirms this. Almost all of them reply: "The vaccine doses are out. Another pharmacy reports to the GA that there are "many customer enquiries". More than 30 are on the waiting list. "Two weeks ago, we got doses delivered," the pharmacist says on the phone. And he has already ordered more. "But we don't know when and how much we will get. In a pharmacy a few streets away a parcel with new doses had arrived. "We've just received some again," says the pharmacist on the phone. 130 doses of vaccine. But even with them, the waiting list is long. "About 40 people are currently on it. A pharmacist from Dransdorf is also waiting for new doses. "At the beginning of the year we had ordered for the doctors," she says. The doses have also arrived and have all been delivered in the meantime. In September, she reordered for the private patients. "Some of them have already arrived," she says, "but the wholesaler we order from had already informed us that it might take a little longer. The pharmacist suspects that the coming flu season might not be too violent. Because the current regulations such as wearing a mask or keeping a distance would protect people against virus transmission anyway. There is still no sign of a shortage of vaccine doses at the Mücke family doctor's surgery. "For people in the risk group and chronically ill people, we still have enough vaccine doses in stock," says Christina Agne, who is a trainee there. The pharmacy from which they received the vaccine doses will contact them again as soon as a new delivery arrives. "When the time comes, they will ask if there is a need.“ Agne can confirm that the rush for flu shots has increased this year. "It is definitely higher than in previous years," she says. And not only among the over-60s. She suspects that this also has to do with the fact that Health Minister Spahn recently called for vaccination. For the time being, however, the practice does not feel an excessive rush: "For us, it is still feasible in terms of time," says Agne. In response to a Facebook call from the GA, most readers replied that they had already been vaccinated. One user wrote: "It's quite unproblematic. She went to her family doctor and was vaccinated directly. Another user: "I had made an appointment with my family doctor and got the vaccination.“ But some people had to wait a long time for their vaccination: "First with a prescription for the vaccine, now it is there after two weeks, and now it takes another two weeks to see the doctor. Everything was off to a bumpy start at first, but it turned out to be something after all. Yet some people wrote that they had not yet been vaccinated.

TD Neale Richmond said, “As we battle against the Covid pandemic, it is vital that every step is taken to reduce the threat of the annual flu season. “The Government is expanding the provision of vaccination without charge to all of those in the at-risk groups, including healthcare workers, and to all children aged from 2 to 12. “Information provided to me shows that the HSE has placed orders for 1.35 million doses of the Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV) for the forthcoming winter. This vaccine will be made available to all persons in an at-risk group from 6 months up.“The HSE has also ordered 600,000 doses of the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV), which is delivered via nasal drops rather than by injection and will be made available to all children aged from 2 to 12 years old inclusive. “The first delivery cycle of QIV influenza vaccines to all sites (GPs, pharmacists, nursing homes etc.) started on 17th September, with deliveries continuing to all sites every two weeks. “By the end of the second cycle of deliveries last week, approximately 800,000 doses of influenza vaccine were delivered to over 3,000 sites across the country. “This represents an increase of 25% in quantities of vaccine delivered when compared with 2019. “To date all sites have received 75% of the quantity used last season, and the allowance for the third delivery which began from 15th October will increase this to 90%. Further stocks will be available for the fourth round of deliveries. “Deliveries of the children’s flu vaccine started on the 28th of September, and all of the total order of 600,000 doses is expected by mid-October, as planned.“However, this is not the end of it. Those not covered by the public vaccination programme can avail of influenza vaccination from GPs and pharmacists on a private basis. “There are ample stocks and I am urging everyone to speak with their GPS and pharmacists about getting the flu jab. I’m booked in for my jab, are you?,” Deputy Richmond concluded. Sarah Brooks Sarah has worked in marketing and content creation for many years.
